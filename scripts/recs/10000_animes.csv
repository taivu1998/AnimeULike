An animated film describing the bullying of a Japanese child.,5.37,5,9999,9206,1755,9,"                              so, I'm not quite sure at all what they were trying to do with this movie but to me it feels totally disjointed and without coherence for the most part. it also feels like a mind-control device at times,with all of the flashing and propaganda. storywise, (SPOILERS) it claims to be about a boy who get's bullied; a boy does get bullied but this isn't necessarily the focus, as this feels secondary to the anti-modernization of Japan statements and imagery. Artwise, this at times, looks striking and has very interesting animation style, but at other times, the art leaves something to be desired and the          
                              Wow.  This is a really rough show to watch.  I will say up front that it is not very good, but its importance definitely outweighs its quality.  
                              This is f * cked up movie, to be completely honest with you guys.
                              People saying this isn't worth your time just have no taste in avant-garde art, so if you do like surrealist and experimental stuff definitely give this a watch. The first song that plays should be more than enough to engage you.

                              What in the actual f*ck did I just watched, I mean not that this is the weirdest anime I've seen, but it is the most incoherent."
