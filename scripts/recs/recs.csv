5114,11061,89,"Both are the best shounen in the world to me! They start off with adventures of a brave main character and go on into darker themes. Love the way the character opens and evolves throughout the story. 
Both series have an innovative and entertaining argument. The characters are so real; they are not the typical kick ass character. For that reason, the strategies are the most important at the moment of fight. 
Both have 'magic', alchemy and and aura, except with the former the source is external, latter internal. Alchemy is based off medieval historical musings, aura is modern parapsychology, but it also seems derived from Chinese Chi. In contrast, though, FM's antagonists follow the cardinal sins' tropes, which results in predictable behaviour based on past performance, whereas HxH has more unpredictable personalities and antagonists do not necessarily antagonize, although there is a central commonality in the origin of both when it comes to how they came to be. FM is more action-oriented, HxH more psychological. 
Both are remakes of two of the greatest shounen anime out there. What makes these two shows stand out from the majority of the shounen genre is that they have well developed characters along with a consistent plot. Also, there are absolutely no fillers in either of them. 
These two is an example how the shounen anime should be..Borrowing a quote from one of review I saw in MAL, the shounen animes should be like these, intelligent but exciting ... 
Both FMA: Brotherhood and Hunter x Hunter (2011) are series that have great story plots involving many characters. The characters themselves are well developed as each episode progresses. Additionally, there are themes of vengeance, friendship, honor, and pride that are explored many times throughout both series.The main male protagonist from both series has a cheery attitude but is always willing to help others in need by putting themselves in danger to protect in what they believe in. There is also a fictional dangerous group in both series who serves as primary antagonists. Among those antagonists are characters who have diverse personalities.These two series are considered shounens but are presented in a different way that is appealing and holds strong sense of value through its plot development. There is also great humor, catchy scenes/dialogues, and emotional moments that are memorable.  read more 
Both are shounen with darker, more mature themes. In both stories, the main characters are on a journey to find something and meet many different (interesting) kinds of people along the way. 
Both are about friendships and brotherhood (duh), are actually are very, very good shonens (some of the best anime overall), and don't have many typical/cliche moments.Oh and one more things: Characters actually die! 
Both are remakes that don't have fillers or meaningless fighting and rely more on strategy and wits. 
Great story with no cliche stuff. Both similar as they talk about friendship/brotherhood.Equivalent exchange is an important aspect of the story.  
I found the suspense, character development, and driving story that are very similar to each other kept me glued to both the whole time. You definitely need to watch them both to understand. 
Being both not-just-regular shounen, they're pretty much similar in the way they use the element of suspense, which is marvelous in both of them. Also alike is the use of comedy. They also resemble each other in the way they treat of matters such as values and life itself, and each of their corresponding main characters have a particular personal goal. Oh, and they've both had a previous animation work before they had even ended (Fullmetal Alchemist) or gone far ahead of the script (Hunter x Hunter).Personally, this are my two favorite shounen. 
They're both the most mature and clever shonens out there. It's not all about fighting,and that's why Fma and HxH are completely different from the regular shonens. The character development is amazing. Hunter x Hunter 2011 character's design seems childish,but the plot is dark,serious and full of suspense,just like Fma. They're both remake with no fillers. One more thing: characters actually DIE! without resurrection bulls*it. 
Both anime incorporate strategies and tactics into their fight scenes. Characters are similar as they travel and take their journey in order to reach their goals while becoming stronger along the way. Lively, bright, optimistic characters with supernatural powers. Two very brilliant animes that will not disappoint.  
Both series are top grade battle shonen that are plot driven, have no fillers and have a great cast of characters to boot! If you are a fan of good  storytelling and fights that focus more on brains and less of brawns, then you definitely can't go wrong with HxH 2011 or FMAB. 
The characters in both of these anime are trying to become stronger and have a goal they are trying to reach. 
Hunter x Hunter and FMAB are both very smart series and set themselves apart from most of the Shounen genre. They both share similar principles such as the infamous equivalent exchange and to gain you must give. The fights in both of these series also aren't just about who's the strongest or has the most will power and the one who's smarter and uses the best tactics  will usually win.  
Two of the greatest shounen anime; both of them are really addictive. Both consist of a unique superpower: alchemy in FMA and nen in HxH. The difference is that HxH's antagonists are more likable than FMA's. 
The two shounens to be built in a mature way make the viewer is caught in strong and very beautiful plot, besides the production of the two animes are equivalent, if you're a fan of one, is sure to be another fan :)) 
Detailed, tactical fights that need brain and brawn. 
They are not the typical shonen where you win through the power of friendship and struggles not good draw strength for a final attack and always beat the bad guys. These two are more realistic shonen. 
Both Anime have well-polished story, action, bunch of emotions, character progression in MCs as well as in side characters. They explain how things work in their ""worlds"" leaving annoying plot-holes away. If you enjoy action and adventure anime you should watch these!  
The anime has both protagonist that are badasses. Both shows are really good that makes you smile. And protagonists are really strong at a really young age ( both are fast learners ). 
If you have something, keep it, or someone more tactful will get it from you.Remakes that will change your point of view from typical relationships (I mean the brother relationship and friendship.) They will open your eyes at the things you have to know at every situation and one more thing, BOTH THEM HAVE PERSISTENT MAIN CHARACTERS that will never give up.  
Both have similar qualities, like both are Coming of Age type stories, but both take place in a world that is alive with other characters. Both involve the protagonist having to get a certification allowing them to pursue their MacGuffin, and during/after their acquisition of the certification, they uncover a plot or scheme. It's fairly good. 
One of the best shounen/action anime with great plot and reasons behind wvery battle. Great animation and the battles are strategic instead of pure fighting. Also there's almost no fillers 
- Both of them are masterpiece- They've got great, original story- Both of them contain great fighting scenes 
As these two are both shounen series, they are both exciting and makes the audience engage with its amount of elements hidden. These two series provide character depth and their storytelling are both well-made and helps move the story along. 
Both series are heavy on both character development and the relationships between said characters. 
Two of the best damn shows I've ever seen, with large casts of complex characters and stories that put the journey before the destination.  
Both anime tackle similar themes- typically intelligent and dark ones. Both anime as well focus more on battle tactics, rather than just full-out attacking. Both main characters have lost something they want to get back: Edward Elric wants to get his and his brother's bodies back, while Gon wants to find his father, and this makes both protagonists to carry on trying to find what they wish to find. Both anime are remakes, and many characters actually die. 
These are two of the best anime ever made. Both are very epic Shounen anime with lovable characters and captivating powers. Both anime are remakes and leave little room for fillers.  
Amazing and relatable characters, beautiful animation and sountracks, and too many moments of happiness, tranqulity, fear, anguish and sadness, all of this in two exceptional and well-written stories. 
Hunter x Hunter (2011) and Fullmetal Alchemist:Brotherhood may not have many similarities when you first look at the two, but to me I have to say they are incredible and if you've seen one, you must see the other.Hunter x Hunter (2011) is the story of Gon Freecss trying to find his father, while Fullmetal Alchemist:Brotherhood is the story of Edward Elric trying to find a mythical stone. Both have simple and slightly selfish ordeals for their own benefits, but as the stories progress and the characters grow up the plot advances and both Gon and Edward become the center of an alliance that are fighting against a world threatening entity. (I can not say too much due to spoilers). Gon and Edward are the main characters, as well as their partner, Gon's being Killua and Edward's being his brother Alphonse. This is a partner that never leave's their side. The stories have several other similarities, all that are the subject of spoilers and so will not be mentioned. The overall enjoyment from these two series was extremely equal, the climax of the series was extremely fun to watch and in both series every character is written beautifully and is given the perfect amount of time to become likable and evolve. To anyone who has seen Hunter x Hunter (2011), you should definitely consider Fullmetal Alchemist:Brotherhood. To anyone who as seen Fullmetal Alchemist:Brotherhood, I highly recommend Hunter x Hunter (2011).If you give both the series a shot as  I am fully shore you will enjoy which ever you chose to watch respectively.  read more 
Both are shounen packed full of suspense, action and emotion. While HxH is longer it had more of a open ending than FMAB, which had a more definitive ending to its story. These animes will make you laugh and cry, and at the end of it all you'll be simply awestruck.Both anime have great art and music, features two MCs and depict a massive crisis in their own way. One you start watching, you just can't stop!! 
Both series are well writen (not like this recommendation), well animated, great songs and great caracters. Probably one of the best shows you can find if you like action with well thought fights and great arcs. 
Both series have a great evolving long story about winning with not just only power but also with strategy. the anime's both have monsters in them and are some good  high rated' anime's. 
Okat this isn't exactly the same as Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood but really close when it comes to a good story telling. The characters Gon and Killua reminds me of Ed and Al, Gon and Killua also go through many hardships together and they make many sacrifices along the way. Abit longer than Fullmetal but worth it. 
Both are outstanding animes in all categories. The art is impressive, just like the storyline. In my opinion, they are a ""must watch"". Don't let the lenght fool you, Hunter x Hunter will get you hyped even after you finish it (just like Fullmetal) 
Both are not your typical shounen fighting superpowers. Both main characters have some sort of major influence from their father. Both have similar characters, themes, and can overall be an emotional experience. 
If you have watched one of this two masterpieces I'll tell you why you have to watch the other:*Incredible storytelling*Deep emotions*Charachters that you won't forget*Very beautiful animation*Great soundtrackIn short, both animes have everything that a good anime should have(action, drama, comedy,...) 
Well both involve relatively large worlds being discovered by the two main male characters (though HxH's is more colourful imo) and both have a large cast that get developed throughout the course of both shows (though certain characters may not be as developed as much as you'd want them too) and both crescendo in large scale battles that involve most of the cast ending with half (or an entire episode in FmaB case) where they give us a 'where are they now' segment.  
FMAB is slightly darker, but both anime share the same adventure style and comedy with a similar sort of style. They both involve a young, male protagonist, and their determination for their individual goals. Lots of interesting/ slightly odd characters and creatures that feature in both. 
I consider these two anime masterpieces. Both have great characters, development ( both that of character and story), interesting fights , great music themes, ops and eds. I thought that Fmab and hxh would be the typical shounen, blabla, bright adventure etc: I was fucking wrong, both can be dark at times. The protagonists aren't overpowered. One thing you wouldn't like in hxh though: Unfinished :S 
Both are very serious stories with MANY characters who are all fleshed-out, many amazing arcs, great animation, and a very good soundtrack to back everything up. 
I've seen anime with more similarities between each other, but these two definitely share common traits. First of all, they can both make you extremely furious regarding all the death happening around, even though most dying characters are supporting characters. With that said, I would say Hunter x Hunter was better in many ways, especially by concealing its true nature. The main characters also have this, well, to say, a ""childish"" goal of either finding or restoring something regarding their own family member. Along with that, both of their fathers are ""big shots"", and their sons are young, unique talents who inherited those traits from their fathers. Also, the makers both know how to make the last battle long, showing everything happening with every individual involved. You get pretty tense and even exhausted. Not only that, but in both cases the characters have to plan things out so carefully that you get scared of what'll happen. Both are worth a watch! read more 
 Both anime revolve around a protagonist in search for something and going out to an adventure, involving magic, action sequences and darker themes, which become a bigger part of the story in later episodes. 
Well i dont know any anime fan who hasnt watch any one the 2 both are incredibly good but hunter x hunter will probably never be completed since the mangaka stop writing but the anime in this case is still awesome and fullmetal alchemist brotherhood is a must watch u never get boring watching it at least i didnt. Enjoy 
Well developed and realistic characters, expertly crafted storyline, very focused plot, no filler and minimal fanservice. Where FMA follows two brothers on their quest to reclaim what is lost, HxH focuses on four individuals in their search for what is dear to them. Both series follow the adage: what's learnt on the journey holds more value than that which you search for. This is neatly summarised in HxH's final dialogue: ""you should enjoy the little detours to the fullest, because that's where you'll find the things more important than what you want."" Both series will rip your heart out and affect you in ways you least expect, guaranteed.  read more 
Two of of fav animes ever, both adventures that you will get hooked on within the first few eps :D. 
Standing Ovation to both productions! 5 out of 5 stars. 10 out of 10, A+, 100%Both shows being two of my favorites on MAL, I consider them not just adventure stories, but odysseys. Edward and Alphonse are on an odyssey to recover their bodies, Gon is on an odyssey to meet his father. As I am a proud adoptee, I love that not only are the main characters adopted, but that there are so many older characters who try to take Ed and Al and Gon respectively under their wing as their sons (Mae Hughes and Roy Mustang with the Elrics, Leorio and Kite and Morel with Gon Freecs). Kudos to those characters!Everyone has already mentioned the similarity between both series' main characters, I completely agree. Al acts as Ed's foil, Killua acts as Gon's foil. I also love the fact that not only did my fav voice actor Keiji Fujiwara voice Leorio and Col Mae Hughes, but those two look so alike with the tall, dangly, be speckled, cool guy look. So cool! I thought most of the similarities to each show happened during H x H Chimera Ant arc because both arcs are coincidentally similar length (about 65 episodes), both coincidentally share voice actors such as Roy Mustang and Knov, but also these are the most famous arcs in anime repertoire. Both massive arcs explore in their own writing what it means to be human by outlining examples of what it means to not be human. The Chimera ants are humanoid and quite complex, but are not humans (they seemed beyond the humans in power). The Homunculi are also not humans though they blend in so well, and they like Chimera ants look down at humans in power. The climaxes of both arcs comes after waiting 30 episodes and boy do they deliver. Fights are all cerebral, not just flashy visuals. This trope is probably influenced by Jojo's Bizarre Adventure fighting mechanics. This keeps all the battles psychological, and unpredictable to the audiences. In other words, both series take to heart that Power level alone does not guarantee victory, it is always the most intelligent fighter that wins. Music is phenomenal and memorable in both series. Much like how Jojo's or DBZ aged so well as anime and manga that they later inspired or influenced later generations of anime writers (coincidentally, these productions were influenced!), I see that it is only a matter of time for these two shows to age ten or twenty years before they influence the next generation of writers.To sum up both series in an adjective that gives the shows justice has failed me. I think good adjectives might be magical, inspiring, masterpieces. read more 
This anime is similar to Hunter x Hunter, but not as good as HxH, anyway I recommend it to you guys. The climax of both are very similar, the production is excellent and the plot is also great. 
Primarily it's amazing how both shows slowly get darker and darker, smoothly becomes what it doesn't seem from the cover. Both shows have brilliant character development, it's really really surprising how good it actually is. There are more similarities, but for the sake of your potential upcoming experience with the show...my recommendation will refrain from spoiling. 
Both series have a similar stories to tell. Where one puts in a world of alchemy, the other puts you in the world of nun, which has its own rules and restrictions. Both series are well received by the community for good reason, and I highly recommend you check the other out if you haven't yet. 
Along with these powers can come a strong darkness. Where is the line drawn as to how far these powers will be used for selfish conducts? Is being the most powerful being what is important?Both anime are adventurous. They start off on a similar note as to starting an adventure. It is for the search of something, FMA to a philosopher's stone and HxH to Gon finding his father. Both have overpowered supporting characters. 
Very similar feel to the world, and the aesthetic is mildly similar between the two. A pair of teenagers wander the world in service to an objective that becomes murky over time as they are swept into a grander plot with the fate of the world at stake. They are both spectacular shows as well, as seen in their MAL aggregates. 
A young prodigy leaves his hometown in order to achieve his goals. During his trip he meets allies and enemies with unique personalities and habilities and he will struggle to become stronger. The final FMA:B arc is somehow similar to the Chimera Ant arc from HxH. Action scenes where tactics are more important than power, drama and casual comedy in both. 
- Both Battle Shounen Anime- Both are about Friends and teamwork- Dark stories- Suspense and character Buildup are similar 
These anime got great animation and what the good of these both anime is the story, the fighting is so good, and the adventure is totally amazing and intense. The Hunter X Hunter is about finding the father of the main character who become a legendary hunter and the Fullmetal is two alchemist seeking for philospher's stone for a certain reason (i will not spoil the anime of course...) 
First recommendation so i'm keeping this short. ~Both deal with Main Protagonist having a goal they want to achieve~Both anime has intense battles along the way~Both anime's storyline is amazing Edward wants to get his body back While GON wants to Find his father and become a hunter. 
Two wonderful works that perfectly fit the definition of ""genre deconstruction"", both being considered as shounen animes, but delivering much more than that. 
Both are the best shounen in the world to me! They start off with adventures of a brave main character and go on into darker themes. Love the way the character opens and evolves throughout the story. 
The way the two animes work the series of events and how they explain everything that happens in relation to the powers and they do not keep hiding facts and creating things of nothing like other animes that exist by there ... At last they are also a type of anime that Should be taken seriously that impact scenes should be caused at the correct time and not just the lack of a plotSugerir uma edição 
Both feature excellent power systems (Nen/Alchemy), enjoyable and somewhat dark plots, excellent character development, and both sides have an incredible sense of adventure. The characters on both sides are excellent. If you want another nerve-wracking adventure series like HxH, FMA: Brotherhood is the go-to anime. Overall, however, HxH is more touching and has better world-building, while FMA: Brotherhood hits a perfectly good storyline in a lesser number of episodes. 
When it comes to consistency of episodes, quality of writing, the premise of the characters, and the majority of episodes that relate to the story intself, these two anime are shounen anime when done right. With the fights being logical as they both have unique power systems, it really shows out compared to some of the more popular shounen anime out there. The characters for both series all have understandable issues, and both series treat their characters right. Overall, these two may not seem that relatable, but when it comes to quality of writing and consistently, these two show a majority of that.   
They are both really good TV shows. If I had to pick between Hunter x Hunter and FullMetal Alchemist: Brotherhood to put in #1 so far on a top 50 list, I would have a really hard time. Definitely check out Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood if you like Hunter x Hunter 
The story at the beginning is light then as time goes by the plot is getting serious. Both MC has a title in the community like an Alchemist or a Hunter. Powerful villains and side characters. Fun to watch. 
Both have great main charactersAlso searching for something 
Both series have depth in their characters without leaving the plot 
- Both anime embark on a grand adventure- Main Characters of both are generally comedic, but get serious when necessary- Both have extremely well animated and meaningful action scenes- Both have disturbing and tearjerking moments- Both push the limits of the shounen genre 
FmaB and Hxh 2011 both tackle darker themes and subvert shonen tropes. In both shows the characters go on a long journey to find something important and on their way encounter interesting viallins. Also in both shows strategy and comparability is way more important in combat than raw strength. 
Both are different from generic shounens with a unique storyline and good character development. 
Both are shounen anime that could be classified as seinen (IMO) because of how deep the story is. Both animes are rare masterpieces from the mediocre sea of anime. A must watch would definitely raise your standardsP.S Before watching both of these anime, I find Naruto ""ok"". After watching these anime  I find Naruto garbage 
Both are well written and have superb entertainment all the way. 
Both have young male protagonists that have had fathers absent from their lives for a very long time. The main battle system does not just consist of punching people really hard, most of the time. Having both nen and alchemy being some of the best battle systems in the genre.  
Both are the peak shonens. They don’t have a similar story in fact they’re so different but I have enjoyed them the same and both are rare shonens that I gave 10/10. 
Both are about two youngs boys that are going through adventure that eventually becomes dark and dangerous. And both are simply the best shounen anime ever made! (At least for me) 
Out of all the anime I've ever watched, two have always stood out- Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, my 2nd favorite, as well as Hunter x Hunter (2011), my all-time favorite. These masterpieces both have an astonishing, unpredictable plot line, extremely well-developed characters,  and will both suck you in as well as leave you sad after finishing. (Plus, their soundtracks are pretty dang amazing). If you liked Hunter x Hunter OR Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, I can almost guarantee you'll like the other one- and not just because they're kind of similar. 
Masterpiece dos shounens 
Calidad, género y trama buenísima 
FMA Brotherhood I'd say is similar to HxH because of the genre both the series are in. Anyways, both shows executed with excellence would recommend watching before you start with others. (Just to get a taste of high quality y'know lol) 
Both are as dark as it gets and also two of the most flawless and well written very very engaging stories, with everything from ops/eds to osts to voice acting as good as it gets 
The same type of Shounen, with an interesting story and good characters 
these are both good in many ways such as fighting,story,plots and both have good pace both have good in depth characters, i would recommend this to any on that have started watching like me  
Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is without a doubt one of the greatest shonen of all time. It touches on deep themes just like hxh. In my opinion hxh is the greatest shonen and FMAB and OP are the only others that come close. 
These two are similar because they both have epic fights scenes, great characters and a good plot they both have powers, Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood has the power of alchemy and Hunter X Hunter has the nen power,both are great animes! 
Shounen and super powers are commmon in both of them, though HxH wins when you start judging on the basis of character depth. FMAB is good, but not as good as HxH, just watch it bruh 
Starts off kind of light-hearted but progrssively gets darker in absolutely perfect way. 
both are great shows with deep themes and fantastic characters and similar(ish) tone "
5114,16498,35,"Revenge, Suffering, Agony and Redemption...Shingeki no Kyojin has a feeling of FMA Brotherhood in which a kid who lived a peaceful life gets thrown into a dark grim life full of tragedy and agony due to losing someone important to them. However, both main characters refused to move on and dedicated their lives for revenge and redemption.If you enjoy a full packed action dramatic plot you'll love both of these series. 
There's a reason they have both become such a hit. Because they were brilliantly epic! If you intend to make your tv show life worthwhile, watch this show next. Strong plot, strong character, strong music. All in one made a show the best. 
The loss of mothers plays a significant roll in shaping the characteristics of the protagonists of these two shows. The main characters are enrolled in some kind of military because of personal reasons and are fighting against supernatural enemies. The setting is an alternative steampunk-ish world with the similar use of tools and weapons. Both are considered shounen anime but tend to look like a seinen because they feature above-average violent situations and epic fights but also deep conversations and some philosophy about the human mentality. The animation is not really that similar but the coloring is, using earthy and dusty color almost always.  
FMA brotherhood is my favorite tv anime, but shingeki kyojin has the potential to top that which i thought was impossible. Both protagonists have an incredibly tragic beginning which opens up into an amazing story that is based off of this tragic event.warning fma brotherhood leans more on the shounen side, while shingeki no kyojin has a lot of gore and a a good amount of ""what the fuck moments"". 見てください！このアニメわすげい楽しいですから見て！ 
- Kids used to live in a peacefull city- The main characters are siblings + childhood friend- The 'trigger' is the death of the mother (and wow, they look similiar and they even have the same Voice Actor)- Even though the father is alive, he seems to be absent in the beginning. Both dads have a similar appearance and they seem to be involved in the 'mystery' (titans/alchemy)- There's a focus on military- Almost the same amount of blood/violence/gore- There are also some strong female characters, without fanservice- Both live in a westernized world 
Well, there's certainly a similar vibe in terms of family loss based on the two main characters of the series. In fact, Eren & Mikasa from SnK/Edward & Alphonse from FMA: Brotherhood lost family members after tragedies. These left emotional scars in themselves and made a strong impact throughout their lives. However, they are able to stay alive and take back what's theirs through determination and instinct.There is a focus of military in both series although for very different reasons. The main characters gets involved directly with the military for their own reasons as well. Throughout the series, their skills increase as they fight for what they believe in. Both series contain plenty of chances for drama, action, and emotional moments. There are occasional comedic moments as well (more so in FMA: Brotherhood). Both series also contains tragic scenes that has left painful memories into the characters of their worlds. read more 
Now plot-wise these two share little similarities other than the fact that each anime's main protagonist is a younger male who loses his mother in the beginning of the story. The reason for my recommendation is the incredible quality these two (mature) anime share. Both have incredible stories, with numerous plot twists. Both are very action-heavy and don't hold back any punches with gore and mature themes. If you enjoy one of these, then I'm certain you will enjoy the other. 
*Also similar to the 2003, but Brotherhood was better*There's a thing that makes the main character different from the rest, a special power of some sort. Their parents play a key role in the plot, and both the daddies are mysterious fellows. The stories themselves are amazing, and also pretty dark and gory. To top it off, the soundtracks for both are phenomenal.  
The main characters are both thrust into the epic battles after losing their mothers. The enemies on both series tend of get their body parts blown off a lot, but they just regenerate themselves. The orchestrated soundtracks are really good and fitting for the situations they're used in, and battles tend to span multiple episodes. 
Both feature Teen's boy with terrible home-live, fighting to protect humanity, alone with their sibling and Blonde sidekick. Have very engaging stories, with actual character development and plot-twist a plenty.Both are very famous in the Anime Community, so you really should watch both  
- Eren and Ed both lose their mother and this changes their lives for ever.- Both mothers happen to be voiced by Yoshino Takamori. Coincidence? I think not.- Similar amount of gore- Stories that never fail to leave you guessing- Easily breaking all 'typical' shounen story cliches- Lots of thought provoking underlying messages- NO blatant fanservice and weak female 'damsel in distress' characters- LOTS of badassery- High quality animation, AMAZING OSTs and faithful-to-the-manga adaptions- Historical settingsThe two anime have similar underlying themes but are different in terms of actual plot so it's easy to compare them without feeling like one is ripped off from the other. If you like one you should definitely watch the other. read more 
Both set in the past but with some form of futuristic technology. Both protagonists start off as young children and the story is about them maturing and becoming strong. Both have dark themes and good action sequences. 
While both series are basically not comparable to anything else ever created i think they have similarities in the realism of characters in there reactions to situations.  
Both series involve main characters who face through extremely difficult situations from loss, revenge, sadness, pain, and suffering. Edward Elric and Eren Jaeger have a strong drive that motivates them to achieve their goals as Edward wants to recover his body back from committing a taboo while Eren wants to not only adventure outside the walls, but also wants to kill all Titans. They also want to protect their friends no matter what the cost is.There are many plot twists and many moments within both series where you don't know what the outcome will be. They have a lot of suspense and have very intriguing stories. However, the story in Attack on Titan is darker than FMA.Both series have a vast array of characters who all serve a purpose to the main story. You really come to love some of these characters as you see them develop or change and some have unique personalities. However, you never know which characters will survive until the end.Both series involve the protagonists facing enemies who seem almost invincible and must use their skills and wit to outmatch them. They also have plenty of beautifully animated action scenes and powerful soundtracks with orchestras that draw you into the story even more. read more 
Both protagonists from Shingeki no Kyojin and FMA:B (Eren and Edward repectively) have lost their mothers and both their fathers are missing. Both protagonists are arguably of European descent and live in a westernized world. They are both determined to make things right in a cruel world but they quickly realize the dream they are chasing concerns not only themselves and the people the hold dear but the rest of the world too. All the while, they try to figure out the enigma that is the world they live in and reconcile themselves with the cruelty of such a world and a sense of helplessness that it engenders. Both protagonists aim to reach their goal but in order to do so they must join the military, not knowing where it will take them.  read more 
Both main characters have a goal to pursue. Both animes are full of light-hearted, dark and serious moments and both have plot twists which will leave you speechless. 
Let me start off with how both anime are complete masterpieces. You will notice some anime have good stories but aren't well told. These, however, are on godly levels.The most enjoyable anime are the intense ones, and fullmetal alchemist delivers. I wasn't kidding when I said that it is on a godly level. Not like in dbz where goku surpassed god in the first series, but to the point where the main villian in the show must sacrifice the entire world to gain the literal earth-shattering power to kill the god people admire so much. And only then will he unlock the true secrets of the universe.

Both are about a main character that lived a normal life but one day their life turns dark and grim, full of tragedy and agony due to losing someone close to them, both main characters refuse to move on from their past which makes them want redemption and revenge  
Revenge, Suffering, Agony and Redemption...Shingeki no Kyojin has a feeling of FMA Brotherhood in which a kid who lived a peaceful life gets thrown into a dark grim life full of tragedy and agony due to losing someone important to them. However, both main characters refused to move on and dedicated their lives for revenge and redemption.If you enjoy a full packed action dramatic plot you'll love both of these series.  
These anime series share the same formula, you can see other recommendations where people already mentioned those similarities. FMA has a little more light and funny tone with cheesy jokes and funny characters, while AoT is much more brutal and gives a lot of sad and dramatic moments, giving a taste of despair. Despite those differences they are very similar and the plot is quite intriguing. I enjoyed both, FMA is my favorite and AoT is the second favorite, but it may change when the story of AoT will be finished. 
Similar settings: vaguely fantastic medieval Europe in the throes of unstable governance. 
Fullmetal Alchemist (FA) has super humans or homunculus that preys on humans. Shingeki no Kyojin has Titans doing the same thing. Both anime is about the survival of human against a stronger species. Both are packed with action.Both anime have protagonists aging about 15-16 years old.Both have characters having European names.Both anime belong to the Military genre. 
A lot of fans have drawn similarities between the plot and the characters - Edward and Eren have very similar goals, character arcs, and backstories. The plot is also very similar - tragic childhood (Eren's mother was devoured by a Titan before his father went missing, and Edward's mother died due to an epidemic after his father went AWOL - he and Alphonse later attempted the sin of human transmutation in an attempt to resurrect her), etc. Both have a ton of action, feels, and great characters. Just watch out for the fandoms. 
Both are in the action and adventure genre, and both have this intense level of suspense that keeps you on your toes throughout the whole series. Both also have wonderful character development. 
Two legendary animes you must watch before you die Similarities:The loss of mothers plays a significant roll in shaping the characteristics of the protagonists of these two shows.The main characters are siblings + childhood friendAlmost the same amount of blood/violence/goreThere are also some strong female characters, without fan service 
Revenge, Suffering, Agony and Redemption...Shingeki no Kyojin has a feeling of FMA Brotherhood in which a kid who lived a peaceful life gets thrown into a dark grim life full of tragedy and agony due to losing someone important to them.

Like shingeki no kyojin, Fullmetal alchemist: Brotherhood no have mercy with they characters, it`s a ""realistic shounen"" and the history is well planned. You will never be disappointed with animation here, this show have a great production and the fight are very credible.For much people this anime are the best and i not i don`t agree but this thoght is very understandable. Have fun! ;} 
Both have amazing action scenes with a great story and characters 
Since Shingeki no Kyojin writer, Isayama Hajime announced that SNK anime and manga both end at the same time, I can only think of one anime that is as same as it, Fullmetal Alchemist : Brotherhood.Spoilers:They share many similarities.Characters, e.g.Edward = Eren Alphonse = ArminWinry = MikasaGrisha = Van Hohenheim Carla = TrishaRoy Mustang = LeviThey have some great fighting scenes and background music. It makes me enjoy. Most importantly, they are both great shows not because of popularity  but quality. They show some significant issues like equivalent exchange and freedom. Therefore, I would like to recommend these two of the all-time great shows. 
Both series gets darker and more interesting as the series progresses.Both series have interesting fighting system though Attack on titan, as shown in the series always had a disadvantage with the human side as their nature bothers them.Both series uses their military and government aspects very well and both series were pretty strategic/intelligent. 
Both are insanely overrated,mostly 2 of this are very enjoyable,snk is splitted to a season while fmab is a long paced anime(64 ep)Take snk if u want enjoyment and thrill,take fmab if u want story 
Attack on Titan is known for its tightly woven plot and standout story, and Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is the only show I've seen that not only meets the high quality of AOT, but surpasses it. If your favorite parts of Attack on Titan were its cast of characters, the mystery presented, and the many layers of the story, then Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is the best show to watch to get more of this! "
5114,1575,16,"The main characters both gain powers and sacraficed parts of themselves to gain something. Both have a lot of daddy issues. 
Superpowers, ancient evil conspiracies, awesome fight scenes, and a fast-paced story with tons of jokes thrown in. 
Suspense, great power, great characters, militar strategies and war. Code Geass has less of a plot and undeveloped secondary characters comparing to FMA Brotherhood but its story manages to keep you on your seat nevertheless. 
Code Geass and FMA: Brotherhood both combine great action sequences with superb plotlines that explore subjects such as immortality, government oppression, and genocide. 
Both series are based around a group fighting against an much bigger portion of society. Both involve high amounts of military action, political affairs, violence against citizens, and unnatural powers. Some of characters traits can be retaliated when comparing these shows and both have something to do with the destruction of a once powerful country. 
Both have the main character go on a very perilous journey which will effect the world.Both end up having to get help from other people along the way.Both deal with aspects of loyalty, friendship, hardship, trust, etcBoth have great story lines, that have great character development.Both have great fight scenes.Code Geass revolves more around mechas. I was not a huge mecha fan however I loved Code Geass.Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood (FMAB) revolves more around magic. I did not have any preconceived notions of what to expect from FMAB and I loved the anime.If you are on the fence watch the first 5-10 episodes. If you liked one of these anime I can almost guarantee that you will be hooked. I love both of these anime and if you like one, you will almost with out a doubt like the other. read more 
While these series are very different they are also very alike. There is a certain percentage of people that like one and not the other but the vast majority of people will like both a lot. The main difference is that Code Geass has some plot holes while Fullmetal Alchemist is basically flawless in that regard. However these are both shounens which offer a little more than just fighting. Code Geass is both dumber and smarter while Fullmetal Alchemist is way more serious as well as slower. That doesn't change the fact that these are both excellent series and I recommend watching both of them if you like shounens or if you like the world at war concept from either Fullmetal (the whole ishbalan plot) or Code Geass (Britannia ruling the world). read more 
Both have conspiracy by the governers and supernatural aspect. They are about same length as a series. They both are non-filer and doesn't contain unnecessary scenes in order to keep story fluesnt. Action scenes are similarly attractive as FMA:B combat's are based on alchemy and Code Gaeass combat's are mecha echol but not your typical lame fight scenes 
Both are animes that deserve the adjective epic, in every sense.To be more specific, both feature a really great plot, great characters and amazing action scenes. In CG mechas and strategy are the stars in action scenes, while in FMA:B that rol belongs to alchemy (and a bit of strategy too). Both animes have a really great ending and you will be rating them with a 9 or 10 before the end. 
Both anime's are about a country and it's politics and main character being really involved with it, also both main characters have a special 'power'. 
Even though it doesn't have the technology and mechs, Alchemy is a pretty good replacement, and some hardcore alchemy would be a replacement to Geass. However, the main thing about Code Geass is the complex plot, involving politics and human relations, with interesting twists. And you can find all these things on Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. A very intelligent anime.  
Honestly, if you're a fan of brotherhood, you're going to enjoy Code Geass. Heck, you're going to love Code Geass whether you liked Brotherhood or not (unless you're some anime fan poser, but I have no idea where that'll get you in life - probably the same place the real anime fans end up - nowhere)I'm really bad at this so..... PASTA!!!!!!!!Anyway, check out Code Geass if you want to see the world in a different light and yes, Lelouch is the smartest character in all of anime. This is a must watch for any fan.  
1) Has the same kind of plot. Both MC want to rebuild their country. Lelouch to rebuild Britannia, meanwhile Edward & gangs to rebuild Amestris.  
Both involve a main with an extraordinary power that they use to change the government and achieve their goals. Additionally, both have a plot with many twists that keep you interested. 
Here's a military drama with great narrative pacing, brilliant voice acting, amazing action sequences, and a fantastic script for the majority, if not all, of characters involved. Honestly as one of the best anime ever made. 
Both FMAB and Code Geass has a protagonist who loves his sibling, owning a powerful ability, lost of politics, war, goverment supression againts a certain race, genocide, horrors of war, and a main antagonist with a world-changing goal. "
5114,2251,14,"Surely both series do share a big part together which is the alchemy.Alchemy and all its related things: immortal beings, legends, immortality elisir/philosophical stone and so on.Both stories evolve around the same epoch (first years of 1900) and share amazing main characters.Even if, the style to tell the stories is very different, they both still share a very good music theme as well.If you enjoyed one I'm sure you'll like the other too! I can definitely affirm that both of them are masterpieces. 
Both deal with immortality, an all-cure elixir, and alchemy. Both are great anime with unique and wonderful characters, great animation, very well done fights, and violence & blood scenes. The first thing that comes to my mind when I watch Baccano! is FMA brotherhood. ;) 
Both involve people using alchemy in order to perpetuate their existence, as well as having some crazy stuff thrown in. 
Baccano is more similar to FMAB then any other anime, whenever I watch it I think of FMAB, D. Gray man might have one or two aspects but baccano has dozens of aspects that are similar to FMAB, if you like FMAB you will like baccano, it is stupid that people say you will like Blue Exorcist if you liked FMAB just cause both the main characters have brothers. That doesn't mean it is similar! just one little thing that won't affect your liking of a series! Baccano is a must watch if you if you like FMAB. 
I found them similar because both of them have things about alchemy, but Baccano is a bit more mature and has some gore in it. 
If you liked the whole mystery and conspiracy feeling in Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, than you will like Baccano!Also, both anime have beautiful fight scenes with lots of blood, and extremely badass characters which add a massive amount of excitement to the show.Not to mention both have alchemists, immortals, homunculi, and are based around the same time era of the 1930s.So if you liked one of these anime, I highly recommend trying the other. 
Τhey are both about alchemy ,they both have a huge amount of great characters and great production values too .For a first eye they dont look alike but if you think it a bit they have many things in common 
Large cast of likable characters plus alchemy. Plus both have hilarious comic relief seamlessly woven in-between the serious scenes. 
Both animes share a big part which is alchemy: immortality, legends, elixirs etc. Both of them have amazing characters(main and supporting), a stunning plot/story and of course, spectacular animation/soundtracks. Each and every episode is a huge mystery and it's impossible for you to stop watching. Finally, these two series are some of the masterpieces Japan has to offer. 
both series deals with the concept of alchemy and immortality. both series are extremely epic. 
If you're interested in alchemy or homunculi these are both must watch anime. If you liked one chances are you'll enjoy the other as well although they are quite different in a lot of aspects.  
Similarities:- Both deal with immortality- Baccano has alchemy in it also- Homunculus exists for both- Mystery element- Alot of work with the plot- Violence- has comedic moments and serious momentsDifferences:- Baccano story is scrambled- Full Metal story is more straight foward in terms of plot- Characters are pretty different, no similar ones 
There's a reason why FMA:B and Baccono! are my two favorite series. I'm a sucker for a good story and it is done so so well with both of them. How? Well:-Continuity! Every plot point is relevant, characters are not thrown away, and there are no ass-pulls. The plot is well thought out, with tons of twists and turns that are surprising, yet understandable when you look back on the clues.-Alchemy also plays an important role in Baccano! with an event in the 1700's acting as a catalyst to the main story. Not gunna say more cuz spoilers.-Both involve weird immortality.-BADASS characters.-Brings up interesting philosophical issues.Also, if you like the setting in FMA:B:-It is similar to Baccano! (although Baccano! jumps around a lot chronologically, it mainly takes place in the early 1930's) with similar technology.  read more

5114,38000,11,"Both are Epic Adventures that are about two sibings that go on a journey after there family members died, on this journey the older sibing is looking for a way to turn his younger sibing back to normal, this Journey is also not easy because the sibings must fight many strong many strong monsters. 
-Both include protagonists that are motivated by the goal of saving a sibling that they care deeply for.-The main antagonist is one that is not known to the public eye.-There are lighthearted moments of affection shown in occasional scenes of both fmab and kny.-The siblings in both anime have great disabilities, but they are not helpless at all. They make up for their disadvantages in other ways like brute strength or toughness.-The protagonists have survived tragic backstories.-In both fmab and kny, the protagonists are sent to different locations on their journey to save their siblings, giving the shows a nice, adventurous feel. 
-Both see the protagonist losing their family early in the story-Both protagonists aim to heal their sibling from the traumatic transformation they undergo, and have them traveling all around the world to find a cure-Both involve the protagonist joining some sort of organization to further this goal-Both have similar comedic attributes 
Both helps his brother or his sister back to human.Tanjiro helps his sister Nezuko demon back to human and Edward Elric helps his brother Alphonse to bring his body back. 
When you watch either, then you are likely drawn in by the very concept of the main character's drive. To right the wrong done to their family as they explore an intriguing world with concepts you will come to understand. Both series ends up challenging these stalwart characters on their quest to find the solution to a seemingly hopeless situation.Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood takes a more loose approach, giving these characters time to explore this world and try to understand exactly what it is they are trying to find: the philosopher stone.Demon Slayer takes a more methodical approach giving the solution very clearly, but a most difficult task. Having the main antagonist, the final boss, reverse the issue. Thus, the main character trains to face off his underlings to eventually reach the final boss.While the concepts do differ, their approach to the concept has many similarities due to these main characters.* There is a goon squad under the main enemy.* Their quest is a seemingly hopeless one.* There are various superpower concepts to learn as the story progresses.* They face hardship due to the issue that caused the characters to go on a quest.* Silly things happen sometimes to humanize the main characters, i.e. they aren't aloof robotic edgelords.So, with these in mind, you'll be able to find yourself drawn into each for the same reasons. read more 
Both series have an older brother, who goes to hell and back to save their younger sibling turn back to a human. They also have a strong focus on character and share a similar tone.  
Both series follow 2 siblings after tragedy strikes, struggling to reassemble their lives. They both have a darker somewhat realistic tone to your typical shounen with fairly intelligent likable leads.One thing I find quite striking are these little moments of empathy the protagonists shares with their enemies due to their similarities with the protagonist's sibling.In both series, the elder brother works for a government like organization. As a result, they must travel all over the country as they look for the cure to return their siblings to how they once were. 
Both stories are centered on two brothers. The goals of both animes aim at the recovery of the younger brothers, in the FMAB the body of Alphonse and in Demon Slayer the humanity of Nezuko.There are incredible battles and powerful villains, as well as a lot of blood in the fights. In both anime, the villain who creates all the opponents found during the anime. 
Stories of two siblings finding a way to get their human bodies back 
Both of the Main Characters embark on a journey to seek answer's how to turn their siblings into human again. Both anime are fun to watch! 
Both having funny moment before and after fightingboth anime have the same story,to make mc brother(fma) sibling(kny)return back to human.Both anime using elements to attack like wind,fire,water. The Differences are fma using some pole to create magic while kny only needs a swordtake fma if you want story,take kny if you want graphics :D "
5114,38691,6,"Both feature their own take on science heavily. Dr. stone's science if more grounded in realism whereas FMA:B's alchemy is more exaggerated for it's fictional world. Both science's and the young genius main characters who use it, shape the world around them. Both are exhilarating series with great OST's, plots & characters. 
Remarkably similar show in feel and in concept. Just science instead of alchemy. 
-Both have a focus on creating and making things through science-Both have a similar style of slapstick comedy-Both shine some light on each and every character, so even the minor ones feel like they are part of the crew and not just add-ons 
Science rules the world in these series. Also the main protagonists have amazing hair 
There is something inspiring about full metal alchemist that's hard to explain. You want the characters to succeed and seeing the Elric brothers grow is what makes the show so endearing. Dr. Stone is a series that has that same feel and it's one of the few shows that's on par to FMA with characters and story. If you see FMA as your favourite of all time then Dr.Stone might be a close second. Hell, it might even take the top spot.  
If you are into science and alchemy, these are one of the very best "
5114,10087,6,"Set in a different world, where magic/alchemy is common. They are both fully packed with action, and are likely to leave you on the edge of your seat by the end of every episode. Whether you are looking for something with a similar plot, similar fights or something epic with that dark feel to it; Look up the other if you haven't watched it yet. 
Both are mature action series that have a great set of characters, a good plot, and amazing art. Definitely recommended for action lovers who find Bleach/Naruto/One Piece too childish. 
I can't see anyone liking one and disliking the other.Both animes feature an outstanding plot and really great characters in a world of magic. Maybe Fate Zero is a bit slower, but some conversations between characters are simply remarkable, and I think that some characters (and voice actors) simply surpass FMA ones. But FMA is longer, and it's really epic. 
Ok, this is going to be hard to explain, but first, I will and never compare brotherhood to a crap series. this series is good. Magic (Alchemy), well developed characters, world domination and survive of the fittest. Fate zero put in challenge the skills of their characters, fighting each other to achieve one goal. Same with brotherhood, where the alchemist, using their skill at their full, must uncover all the mysteries behind the ongoing events. Filled with mystery, thriller and action, these both anime wouldn't disappoint you. 
Both series involve some mystical element whether that be full on magic users or a scientific form of modification known as transmutation. These series are, in my opinion, some of the best anime ever created with beautiful animation, compelling characters (both heroes and villains), with an excellent story. If you want to just laugh or chill then these series are not for you, with so many twists & turns these anime offer insightful questions about the essence of humanity. I simply cannot recommend both of these series enough because they are required viewing for anyone who enjoys great stories.  
Both series use a non-medieval and interesting take with magic. Although, while FMA is in the 20s/30s, Zero is set in the 90s. The Battle for the Holy Grail is much like the search for the philosopher stone except that it's more of a no holds barred tournament with very few rules.Fate Zero's main difference is that it expands on the idea of kingship brought up in FMA Brotherhood and the cynical contrast to FMA's optimism. "
5114,30,6,"Although as a genre, they are different but deconstruct them they are truly very similar. Both supposedly anime that are aimed for boys, both transcend their genre by providing plot narratives that tackle universal issues that slowly become personal as the both series progress. 
They're bouth about a force that goes to God, but Neon Genesis is about mecha and FMA is about alchemy... 
FMA Brotherhood and Evangelion have a lot of common discussions through their development: the value of human life, human communication, the confrontation with god, moral and ethics, life and death... Both are great works of art that have humanistic messages and deep philosofical thoughts, and, for that, both are a must see 
Both have symbolisms and philosophies. 
Both, with religious symbolism and humanistic philosophies, are anime with a lot of plot twists and small personal problems raised to huge conflicts of great scale, one through mecha, and the other through alchemy.  
Both are anime full of action and epic scenes, while at the same time dealing with philosophical themes. Both series also share similar symbolism and characters. "
5114,2001,4,"These are both over-the-top anime series that keep you on the edge of your seat. They both contain non-stop action that just keeps getting crazier and crazier. Both of these anime revolve around limitless resilience, hope, and friendship. 
Both very awesome ""action-packed"" anime. Great storyline, very original, balanced characters, and good animation. (I recommend watching the first FMA.) 
Both anime have lovable characters, epic fight scenes, teach a valuable moral lesson and overall just kick ass.  
This is one of the best anime in history, mix of shounen and romance and several epic fights (my opinion) perfect. "
5114,18115,4,"Magi is like a combination of One Piece and FMA, it takes the best of those two and it's a really great shounen. You have to watch the prequel named Labyrinth of Magic first.FMA shares some rather dark themes with Magi, political and socials. 
The best way to put this (without giving anything away) is that magi is the spiritual successor to FMA Brotherhood. Really similar vibe as neither is a typical shounen anime. 
The main characters are very endearing, they have their own personality and are not very similar to those in FMAB. However, the main story are likely, especially the end.It's two world of ""magic"", but in a different kind. FMAB is more based on, close to science where as Magi is more a fantasy world, which reminds me a little of Harry Potter, because we're discovering it at the same time as the characters.To my mind, it's very psychological, there's a lot of moral, friendship and a main goal. There is a lot excellent fight too, very well presented, and it's also pretty fun too.The two anime is very likely but also different, because of theirs large topics which each of anime is focused on.In to my opinion, i have not any preference between this two, because even if the story is kind of similar, the main emotion which we can feel is a little different.I felt more pain, struggle, strong feeling in FMAB in every single episode where as in Magi, it was more hope, joy, a little fear and a lot of compassion but in the whole anime.But if I had to choose one of them, i'd probably chose FMAB because it's maybe more dynamic for me, intense emotionally. read more

5114,34599,4,"Adventure world very original. Both gave two kids trying to find a parent and answers about themselves. There is even a tragic experiment story in both of them. 
Both are fantasy and adventure anime with a strong underlying plot and world, focusing on the fantasy and mysteries of their respective worlds.Both have outstanding storytelling and world building, along with the following similarities:- Both have children as their protagonists- Both of these protagonists are extremely knowledgeable and burdened relative to their age- Both stories start because the protagonist want to help their family, who's in a dangerous and mysterious place- Both stories have their dramatic and somber moments, while being relative lighthearted otherwise 
Instead of just listing in dot points what similar, I'm just going to say one thing.What both these stories have is a similar sense of adventure. Both have a group of characters working towards one goal. Not only are the character from both stories lovable and have in depth backstory, but the adventure it's is fascinating. The worlds they are both set in have lore that is not only explained extremely well but itself is just so damn intriguing. You know the world building is good when you as the audience can imaging thousands of other stories that can be told in the same universe.Any way if all that sounds to vague and doesn't convince you, here's my last point.  After finishing FMA:B, it's always hard to go back to watching other shows without thinking ""This new show it good but...it just didn't have that FEEL FMA:B had"".Well let me tell you...Made In Abyss has that FEEL, and you'll love it. read more

Lots of digging and unfolding, tons of twists, great character development. "
5114,1535,3,"The ""chained"" events is a common feature in both of the animes and do drive you to think. They share Tragedy and happiness moments that are somehow alike (it's like a projection from the world of fullmetal into the world of death note). 
They are both methodical. They make you think and try and figure things out as you go.  You never know what will happen next. 
Both stories are well-written and neither feel the need to fall back on fanservice or raw action to keep the viewer's attention. Though Fullmetal Alchemist has much more action than Death Note, I'd recommend the two to any fan of deep, enthralling story-lines "
5114,6114,3,"Both plots focus on the ""brotherhood"". There are dark settings and suitable music for every part of the story. Both highly recommended if you like mature anime! 
Both series have self reliance in common. FMA shows you the darker side of life and 2 brothers overcoming it. Then there is this series. Be warned it not for the light hearted. I was forced to drop this series after episode 2 because I could not take my heart strings being abused like that.Deep emotions will be felt. You must be ready for them. 
They teach you a lesson why familiy and friends are important, they both have some cruel scenes. "

Rurouni Kenshin and FMA: Brotherhood may have entirely different settings and stories, but the pace and character development in these two shows could not be more similar. Both shows strongly emphasize character development, fully developing the main cast as well as the side characters and villains so the viewer can fully understand all their perspectives. Also, the soundtracks of both shows are flawless.

5114,33352,2,"Violet evergarden has an anchorage similar to fullmetal alchemist, remembered in ancient europe, besides both protagonists lose their arms, and have a warlike climate throughout history, I highly recommend. 
This might seem like an odd recommendation, but I believe both Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood and Violet Evergarden have a lot of similar story elements and themes, with the main difference being that FMA:B is an action-adventure series and Violet Evergarden is a drama.Both series take place in a quasi-steampunk world based on early 20th century Europe, in the aftermath of a devastating war. Many characters in both series struggle to find meaning in their lives after the war is over, and there is a strong undercurrent of loss and redemption. Both series have incredible animation and music, strong character development, great action (although Violet's action is much less prominent in the story), and lots of tear-jerking moments. And to top it off, main characters Edward and Violet both have blonde hair and mechanical limbs.If you love FMA for the fights and fantastical elements, you might want to check out another shonen series like Hunter x Hunter or Shingeki no Kyojin (Attack on Titan). But if you love FMA's deep themes and character drama, you should absolutely give Violet Evergarden a shot. You won't regret it. read more "

Action scenes are similarly attractive as FMA:B combat's are based on alchemy and Code Gaeass combat's are mecha echol but not your typical lame fight scenes "
40028,820,3,"War, political intrigue, and morally ambiguous sides are defining features for LotGH and AoT's Final Season.  Both anime, especially LotGH, focus on every side of the conflict to give a complete picture of the war and blur which side is truly right or wrong. The two series also have a very similar fear of killing off characters (or rather, a lack thereof) with many important character deaths seen throughout both shows. Lastly, they share similarly large casts that continue to make contributions to the plot throughout.Be warned: although Legend of the Galactic Heroes' grand and complex story and character writing is just as good as Attack on Titan's (if not arguably better), the series is much slower paced, less visually interesting, and not an adrenaline rush of constant hype like AoT. read more 
Both are about a war where you get to see both sides and no one can be labelled a good guy or bad guyBoth have a lot of politics and a large cast that all get fleshed out and have importance to the large scale plot  
These anime follow both sides of their respective wars and show both the good and bad parts of them. Neither side is shown to be clearly superior to the other morally-speaking.For example, this similarity can be summed up perfectly in a quote from one of the main characters on the Alliance's side from Legend of the Galactic Heroes:""There are no such things as 'wars between absolute good and absolute evil' in human history. Instead, there exist wars between one subjective good and another subjective good, and conflicts between one righteous faith and another righteous faith. In the case of a unilateral war of aggression, the aggressor would believe in its own righteousness. That is why wars have never ceased. As long as humans believe in God and in righteousness, there is no way conflicts would ever disappear.""- Yang Wenli read more "
40028,5114,2,"Both are about philosophy morals etc, both have an amazing cast of characters and great female characters which unfortunately isn't much present in anime. 
Both are Shonen/Seinen series with incredibly rich writing, world-building and story-telling. They are modern classics and I would argue that they are both top 3 anime of all time. Everything, down to the smallest details, is connected/explained by these shows and they do not fail to deliver. The music, animation and art style are also really good. Must watches in my opinion. "

9253,31043,111,"When someone you hold dear is met the fate of losing their life, and you have the ability to go back in time to that moment to try and save them, do you have what it takes to do it? In Steins;Gate, science is used to create a time a machine, rewinding the clock and changing the course of fate and time by saving the one life (or two) In Erased, it is a slightly more chaotic as there is no science involved, only a lingering sense of guilt and the ability to rewind the clock before a drastic event occurs.These parallel lines were what drew me to Erased, and I wasn't disappointed. It did remind me of Steins;Gate with the aspect of time traveling to save a loved one. Changing the course of the present and time itself by making that one change and saving this one life, no matter the outcome. Hence, if you have enjoyed those elements in one of those anime shows, you will definitely enjoy watching the other. read more 
Boku dake ga Inai Machi like Steins Gate is about the main guy who has the ability to time-travel to the past to save someone dear to him. He ends up also having to save another girl from a tragic fate which he has romantic feelings for. Both anime start with a light mood and change drastically to a darker tone, dealing with the constant struggle of the hero endlessly trying to change the outcome of the future by changing the past. Also, If you watch Steins Gate the movie, you will find extra similarities with BDGIM. Really enjoyable animes with lot of mystery, great soundtrack and voice acting that will keep you interested from the beggining to the end. If you're a fan of Time-Travel both are a must watch and you'll definitely like one if you liked the other. read more 
Both of them are in a Dark theme with a wish to save someone in the past, To Fix a problem that happened in either present or past. 
I suppose its tiny bit of a spoiler, but both shows deal with time travel a fair bit. In particular, the main hero of both shows travels to the past for a chance to save the life of someone dear to him, while unraveling the mystery of what is happening around him. Both shows also contain elements of romance.The pacing of the shows is a bit different, as Boku Dake goes a bit faster, and the methods of time travel are different as well. S;G has more slice of lifey moments, and the main characters are fairly different. Theyre both outcasts of a sort, but S;G's protagonist could be seen as more immature.That said, both shows are very solid and if you like one, theres a decent chance youll like the other. read more 
I found that when I first started watching this anime, it instantly reminded me of Steins;Gate. The concept of going back in time and altering the past, and also with the incidents involving the protagonists I found were similar in a sense. Both have the male protagonist going back in time. This leads them to the future to see how what they have changed in the past has affected future events. However, I believe that Erased is more emotional and much shorter than Steins;Gate. 
Travels back in time to save dear ones and the plot makes you grip for more. 
Both involve time travel and heavily feature attempting to change the past for a better outcome. Erased focuses more on mystery and the changes Satoru makes as he relives his life while Steins;Gate centres more around the close relationships between Okabe and his lab assistants.   
Both of the stories revolve around time traveling concept. Both of the MCs are people who want to fix his past mistakes into creating a new timeline where the happy ending exists. 
-Both features the theme of time travel. -Both has the same plot of trying to prevent deaths by changing the future. -Both protagonist act as the leader of a group.-Both protagonist have special time-travelling ability.  
Both animes consist in saving important people to the main character, it is done in a way to make them understand better the mechanics of their ability to time travel.In each anime is presented a mystery about the murder, they unravel the mystery throughout the anime presenting new characters and linking the pieces of the puzzle together.They have extremely amazing history and direction, worth watching and recommending even for non-anime fans, the only bummer for non anime-watchers would be Okarin's personality (Steins;Gate main character) who is an outgoing character that yells and make jokes most commonly observed in japanese midia. 
Both shows involve similar time travel mystery.They are similar in many more ways that I cannot describe, yet I can assure you that you won't regret watching Steins;Gate if you liked Boku dake ga Inai Machi.Don't let the first 6-8 episodes of S;G let you down, it gets better, trust me. 
Dude goes back in time to save chick.Erased has a very visual novel-like atmosphere which is why people are reminded of Steins;Gate, an anime actually based on a VN. The colours used in both shows are quite drab and dark, with a similar atmosphere of desperation. Both shows have an adult cast.Aside from the main point re: time travel and chick-saving; the characters, their interactions, and the themes are all very different. 
- time travelling- save people to prevent serious matters- fight their biggest enemies- Good OP- smart MC- has their own unique artstyle 
-both main character goes back in time to try to change the story and only they are aware of it. 
Steins;Gate and Boku dake ga Inai Machi (Erased) both contain elements of time travel (Steins;Gate more than Erased). Both have really good characters and animation, both have a very interesting and engaging story and really get you invested in whats going on. I highly recommend this! 
This show is frail in comparison to the time travel in steins;gate. In stiens;gate the main character has a personality while retaining the basic urge to save his friends and loved ones. Yeah, you can do that with a personality. Also the time travel itself is the premise and the plot. In Erased time travel is just a tool the main character uses to attempt to capture the killer. In stiens;gate the killer is not obvious and it's very hard to tell when the plot twist will be. Meanwhile in Erased it was so obvious who was  the killer. In fact I didn't think the person could be the killer because it was too obvious. Anyway basically Steins;Gate>ERASED because Erased just wasn't written as cleverly.   read more 
- Very smart main character...- ...who has to get back in time to prevent someone's suffering/death- Clean visuals, catchy soundtrack- Amazing storytelling 
A Series about time Travel and Correcting the past much like Boku dake ga Inai Machi. Light Comedy and a thrilling emotional Story.  
Time travel & try to change destiny 
ON the surface these shows are very similar. There is time travel and the goal of saving people. One of these shows is consistent with its plot and characters (Steins Gate) and one is not (ERASED). One hints at things slowly and one clumsily hits you with blunt clues. I could make this list forever. But at the end of the day I recommend Steins Gate for fans of Erased and not the other way around. 
Steins;Gate and Boku dake ga Inai Machi revolve around the central idea of trying to save a life of someone dear to you by going back in time, only to find out that more problems and challenges have arisen. Steins;Gate explores more in depth into the time-travel theory and where the ability to time travel came from, thus the longer than usual 24 episodes while Boku dake ga Inai Machi takes are more simpler and easy-to-digest approach; just 12 episodes, on the time travel theme to take preventative measures to resolve a death and change the future. 
In both anime the main character has to go back in time to save someone he holds dear 
It's time travel, my dudes. Both are a part of ""good taste starter pack"", both are really good - and both share the main theme. 
Time travel...  
MC experiences time loops. There's an energetic, cute female with a distinct presence. They both start very excited and have a thrilling, creepy vibe to them. 
Both shows give the same feeling, the Main Character in both shows go back in time to prevent something horrible that will happen in the future 
Steins;Gate is also about time travel, the consequences of changing the past and dealing with it's given repercussions. Both show also deal with a lot of mystery that affect both the past and present.If you want more, Robotics;Notes is set in the same ""universe"" as Steins;Gate, albeit a very different type of anime yet 'affected' by the events of Steins;Gate.While we're at it, check out Chaos;Head as well.These three in chronological order are:Chaos;headSteins;GateRobotics;NotesTake it or leave it, your call.Either way, I've personally enjoyed these selections. 
Both anime shows have a complex plot line. Both ERASED and Steins;Gate involve time travelling to prevent something bad from happening. In my opinion, both animes are very similar and both shows are a must watch. 
Time travelers, butterfly effect, grandfather paradox...Steins; Gates is, above all, an incredible story about friendship. Boku take ga Inai Machi shares the framework, the main idea and goal: change the future from the past. 
Both consist of the protagonist having to time travel back to save someone he cares for. Only Steins;Gate  does it better in my opinion and actually has a solid explaination for the time travel mechanism. 
Both show are about time travel. 
Revival=Reading Steiner   ;) Both contain epic time travel. Brace yourselves. 
Both have a relation with time travel and both play with your mind. Moreover, you do not know what's going to happen in any of them. 
Both animes series are based on the ''Time travelling'' subject.    In both of the series the main character is trying to save someone dear to him.  There are major differences in the two animes , like Steins;Gate has a comedy side too and it's not as serious as BDGIM.  BDGIM is more emotional and dramatic.  Both of the series are worth watching , If you liked one of them you will like the other one for sure. 
Both include the theme of time travel, only difference being Boku dake ga Inai Machi is based on supernatural, whereas Steins;Gate is based on science. Boku dake ga Inai Machi is currently airing, showing another theme of having to go back in time to save someone. 
Eccentric MCTime travelAbove Standard AnimationOnly difference is Steins gate did everything else better but took longer to develop it plot.....hence why its above Boku dake on MAL. So if you watched boku dake, go watch this classic. 
Main character in both series are able to time-travel from the present to the past. The story centres itself with the theme of good versus evil with the main character having to make each and every small decision which can greatly affect the future depending on the actions done from the past. 
Same kind of story: time travel, destiny, a bit romantic, friends. 
Both have extremely well and tastefully written plots and characters, are thrilling and galvanizing. They conjure up intense feels and deal with time leaps. 
- Both revolve around the same idea of someone trying to change the future to prevent a murder- Both have protagonists that originally look bland but are actually great characters- Both have quirky looking, realistic characters- The biggest difference is that Boku Dake gets going much faster than Steins; Gate, but even this little detail has made some people think these series are very different 
Similar time travel concepts and psychological elements, and the main characters of both series have very similar experiences. Both series also have a fantastic story and good character development too. 
-Both shows have a time travel setting.-Both shows have lovable characters.-Both shows have the main character trying to save someone.Here's some advice: make sure to watch them back to back. I did that and it was amazing. 
-time travel-trying to save a person changing things on the past-Both have really good plot and drama. 
--In both animes MC go back in the past to change their fate..Though in Steins;Gate, the repeated failure can make you cry... :'(--In both animes... The MC go back in the time to save their beloved ones..--Both of them start off with a light start and then paces up....--And of course, How can I forget about THEM... The cliffhangers in both are just...OTHERWORDLY...(Keep an eye out when watching them, U might actually DIE!)Steins;Gates is a more Sci-Fi based anime...and makes use of time travel theories which actually exists...While Erased does not make any use real life theories and is a bit more Supernatural...But, No Doubt, Both are a MUST WATCH! read more 
Time Travel? Changing the Past? Both of these got it. Plus a whole deal with the psychological effect. Also, each MC has a smart person that figures out that something is up and tries to help. I don't want to spoil either of these series, so just watch it 
Traveling back and forth to the past, to prevent nasty things from happening to the protagonists. Both anime contain few good times too, however. 
Both shows focus on a male main protagonist that has a time-travel ability, that they use to save someone dear to them. 
Both animes are about time travel. Fujinuma Satoru and Okabe Rintarou time travel to past to save someone. Both endure failure and had to travel through time in several times to achieve their goal. This allows them to experience multiple timelines. 
Both series feature spirited protagonists, that might feel isolated from those around them, but are determined to the right thing and fix their mistakes - this may sound clichéd, but they both have enough quirks and enough charm to keep them interesting. From a genre perspective - both feature time travel and the idea of alternate worlds and realities, and the idea of preserving relationships across these boundaries. The artwork, particularly the backgrounds, is something definitely worth noting, as there as some stunning scenes throughout. Steins;Gate has more ""lighter"" moments, perhaps due to the added length, but both series definitely have plenty of suspenseful moments that'll have you moving onto the next episode as quickly as you can. And they both feature ambiguously-gendered boys. :P  read more 
Both of the anime's main character has the abillity to travel in time to save beloved people. Both are breath taking, If you're looking something similar then here it is! Loved it! 
Time travelers, butterfly effect, grandfather paradox...Steins; Gates is, above all, an incredible story about friendship. Boku take ga Inai Machi shares the framework, the main idea and goal: change the future from the past. Rintaro –Steins; Gate– and Satoru –Erased–, are in charge of it. The characters share more than it could seem.  
-Both anime tell about time time travel (especially back to the past).-Both main character try to save someone that important to them. 
they're both about time travel ""kind of"". and they're both really good... that was enough reason for me to watch it xD 
Both stories involve time travel used for the purposes of preventing a terrible eventBoth stories have a murder mystery and friendship as central plot pointsBoth have light romantic undertonesBoth stories have a deep emotional impact and are overall quite touchingIn general, there is a very similar thematic feel between these two animes, and if you like one then you will most likely enjoy the other. 
Both anime series involve a male protagonist going back in time to prevent a death. The difference is that one involves the use of technology to intentionally time travel and in the other, time travel is a super natural ability that the protagonist has little control over. I highly recommend both series and am confident you will enjoy both series' unique approach to stories involving time travel. 
Changing the future by fixing the mistakes done in the past plays a huge part in both series. In both anime, the main character tries to save someone important to them by traveling to the past. Both shows also keep you at the edge of your seat as you follow the protagonist on their mission and see the consequences of the actions and mistakes done by them. 
Both animes are related to time travel and the problems that accompany it.Characters are tested in difficult situations and will face difficult decisions to save their loved ones. 
is about the main guy who has the ability to time-travel to the past to save someone near him. 
This anime series is really similar of steins gate. Bouth are about time travel. 
Steins;Gate and Boku dake ga Inai Machi revolve around the concept of the butterfly effect, where one action causes a chain effect into the future. Both protagonists continually travel back in time to fix the main cause and to fix their futures from something both Okabe and Satoru don't want to have. Both are great fiction animes with Steins;Gate more on a technical, machine level and Boku dake ga Inai Machi with a simple ability. 
If you enjoyed the idea and usage of time travel and manipulation aspect of Erased, you will definitely love Steins;Gate as it expands upon it in almost every way. 
Both involve time-travel, emotions and mystery. Both has main characters in the age range 20-30 (Although, boku dake ga inai machi has the childhood past of the main character where he is a boy). Also, both has some romantic moments. 
Why? because they both have deep emotional story lines. Though both have a slow start if you get past the first few episodes, you will be entering a battlefield of emotions. I cried watching both, and so will you. Enough said! 
The way the protagonist has to go through time and solve his problems  
Another time-travel theory is present in this series, though compared to Steins;gate, Boku dake ga Inai Machi's time-travel occurs as a natural phenomenon instead of actually (and specifically) manipulating time.Both protagonists are on a quest to change the future by saving their loved ones, and their journey of fighting the evil ones (Criminal in ERASED, Organization in S;g) from being successful in their evil deeds. 
Boku dake ga Inai Machi is a very confusing anime and it isn't very easy to figure out whats going on,similar to Steins;Gate where your mind gets blown when the main character discovers something important. This isn't the only reason it is similar to Steins;Gate as the main character in Boku dake ga Inai Machi gets sent backwards in time,with his previous memories when a death or negative things happen around that he has to prevent. 
A powerful and pur love story! This affirmation is perfect for those anime.Like in ,,Stein;Gate"", ,,Boku dake inai machi has a unique way to tell a story by breaking time and help the protagonist to protect his lover and his friends.Those anime are REALLY similar but they stil have their original and exciting story involving time traveling and friendship. 
Both animes have time travels and they need to solve one problem in the past for get a better future. The main characters need to rescue a girl for being murdered, even if their life becomes more dangerous... 
-Both series are based on time travelling-While in 'Erased' its the main character's ability to do so, 'Steins;Gate' tries to put it in a scientific and logical way-In both anime, the main character time travels to save the ones close to them specifically females-Both seem very boring in the first parts of the anime but get excellent later-Erased focuses on the main character most of the time when but steins;gate puts the characters in groups and give an overall view of whats happening not just the main character's thoughts-Both have some great plot twists and one of them revolving around a character-Both have the main character having some psychological conflicts later in the seriesWhile I think Erased fans will love steins;gate, i can not say the opposite because some say steins;gate has that 'Masterpiece' element but everyone has different views so feel free to try read more 
Time travel can become interesting when coupled with great plots, if you look for it in another anime in this story line Steins; Gate was made for you. 
Both features the ability to time travel. They also bring up the subject of tragedy and sadness of attempting to go back in time to save loved ones. Steins;Gate does go on a more scientific route when it comes to time traveling while Erased tends to gear towards the subject of crime and mystery.  
Steins;Gate and Erased share a lot of similar traits:- both involve time travel (though it's explained more thoroughly in Steins;Gate)- MC travels back in time to save a loved one- both have a similar atmosphere/feel- intriguing plot and keeps you on edgeEven though Erased is more of a mystery anime than Steins;Gate, I found myself frequently drawing similarities between the two shows. If you liked the feel and premise of one anime, you will most likely enjoy the other 
ERASED had a potential that was unfortunately never utilized to its full potential, with its conclusion failing to wrap up things as satisfyingly as it should have been. This may have been recommended time and time again, but Steins;Gate is the epitome of time-travel anime, after all, with its science fiction elements fully explored within the course of its whole run and a deeper and darker feeling...that ERASED should've had, mind you, if it was only ever expanded upon aside from being a mere plot device. 
Both anime focus on the male protags travelling through time to save the girls most important to them. However, SG focuses more on the science aspect of the story, while Erased's focus is more on solving a mystery, as well as the protag's feelings about the ""new"" set of people around him.In my opinion, SG is far better because it does not have one tenth the number of plot holes that Erased does, but then again, others will have a different opinion. 
In both cases the protagonist returns to the past, trying to stop something from happening in the future, while struggling to cope with the fact that he is the only one that knows of this future event. Both protagonists are also seemingly helpless when it comes to action, so their struggle is completely intellectual. 
Both involve going back into time to change the future and avoid a terrible fate for a particular character. 
Both of the shows are based on the chaos theory called ""The Butterfly Effect"" which is quite interesting to watch - because I, myself am a big fan of the theory.Both of them have likable characters!Both of them are serious but still have humor in them, even though ""Boku dake ga Inai Machi"" is more serious and much shorter than the epic ""Steins; Gate"" 
Both series involve going back through time. I don't want to reveal too much so I'll leave it like this. Both are great anime for sure. :) 
Both got time travel fantasy on it.Both got alot of drama and plot twists within it. Steins Gate talking about the consicuinces of changing the past. While boku dake ga inai machi changing the past for better future. 
The main character has Time travel manipulation powers which is able to assist him in saving the ones he cares about. 
The MC went back in time to save a girl. Romance is pretty good. Entertaining to watch. Same dark vibe, in my opinion. 
These are both great shows. Both main characters go through similar struggles and repeatedly re-do events for a different outcome. The setting albeit differ from one another still make for very similar shows. Both are great thrillers. I love them both. 
They both focus on a basic concept of time travel(of sorts) and focus on saving a loved one by altering past actions.High on suspense and moments that could give you goosebumps no matter how many times you watch them...Great Stories...Highly recommended. 
Both revolve around time travel to erase past mistakes and fight for a better future. They have really good characters (with similar main characters) and animation, both have a very interesting and engaging story and you really get invested in whats going on. 
Both impossible love storyBoth male lead doing time travelBoth this is best saddnest anime ever 
Both shows feature lovable MC's and heartwarming characters. Both shows also deal with Time travel in similar but unique ways. 
-TIME TRAVEL/THRILLER best combo-GOOD OP-Well written plot (especially S;G)-SMART MC (yes okabe 200IQ confirm)-Both characters are a leader of their group of friend-Both characters got a special time related power-Both characters trying to save their partner 
Fairly dark and psychological time travel shows with interesting art styles and presentation, though with stories that go on different directions. 
Time travel anime about preventing certain events from occurring. 
In both animes the main character travels trough time to save someone they care about. 
Same Plot, but ERASED is a simplified version 
The concept of time travel is very similar and if you watched one of them you'll probably like the other. 
Erased draws the easy comparison to Steins;Gate in that they're both time travel anime. Running the connection a little deeper, Erased is also home to its own set of likable characters and time travel consequences. 
-Tells the story of the male main character who saves the person that he loves-Using time travel concept (Time loop)-bring us about emotional and depressional psychotics complex 
Similar kinda story but you'll get much more different between 'em. Boku Dake ga Inai Matchi has a great story with the MC.s supernatural ability to go to the past and the desire to save his classmate from a kidnapper.I am sure you'll enjoy it. 😊😊      
Both animes have interesting time travel tramas and both characters travel through time to save their dear friends! If you liked Steins;Gate you might like Erased as well. 
Both about time travel and saving someone 
Same ""return to past mechanics"" and very intricate and interesting plot. Just like Steins; Gate, is very fond of the characters. 
IF you like time travelling related animes you will like both of these animes.They are both about time travelling and changing the past. 
both are about time travelling and will surely make you loose your breathe 
Both MCs try to make changes the past occurrences in order to save the girl's life.They both a have an opportunities of traveling to the past, even though in different ways. 
-Both anime revolve around time travel-similar if not same concepts -the main characters spend the entirety(mostly)saving others but in an completely different manner-Awesome ops 
If you like such a masterpiece as steins gate, then you may also like Boku dake ga inai machi, in both anime titles the main character moves in time, into the past in order to change the future, to prevent someone's death or change the future in a good way ... In steins gate, science is used, a time machine, in Boku dake ga inai machi there is no science, the main character has the ability to travel to the past if some bad event occurs. I advise you to watch Boku dake ga inai machi, good anime, that's for sure, you'll love it! I'm sure :) read more 
If you loved the time travel aspect OR the characters of Steins;Gate, Erased should be your next stop. A short anime that features both time travel and lovable characters, it is almost able to match the intensity and depth of Steins;Gate even as it spends most of the story focused on elementary school children. 
Both are great animes. In ERASED there is no scientific logic for the revival but the theme is somewhat similar to that of steins gate. However, steins gate will still be the best. 
They are similar due to the time travelling mechanic both animes possess.But Boku dake ga Inai Machi uses the time travelling mechanic in a kind of different way than Steins;Gate.If you like Steins;Gate's plot I can almost guarantee, that you will love the story of Erased. 
1) Both of them involved a travel back-and-forth between the past and future and the effort to change it2) Both of the characters are a man who want to change certain event to change the whole sequence of the future3) Both of the series involves an intense story and real-life interraction just like your typical daily activities 
-Thriller Anime with Heavy Emotional Beats- Great soundtrack- intriguing mystery elements 
These two go well together because they deal with time travel and the plot twists are as shocking. The protagonists are pretty similar in the way they act which gives them the same appeal. 
Steins;gate is infinitely times better so if you liked Erased this will be amazing. Both revolve around time travel, yet only truly captures the essence of it.  
Similar to Steins;Gate, Erased asks the question ""If you could go back in time to prevent a tragedy of a loved one, would you?"" While Erased ignores science for a more supernatural explanation of time travel, it follows the same principle. Distinctly, Erased touches on the nostalgia of childhood, while teasing the audience with its engaging murder mystery throughout the series "
9253,31240,102,"Beginning with the obvious, both Re:Zero and Steins;Gate were animated by the same studio, White Fox and both main protagonists have time traveling related abilities.Now for the juicy stuff, both Okabe and Subaru are quite different from the usual anime protagonist and aren't meant to be self-inserts for viewers. They both must overcome obstacles to save the ones they love and both feature thrilling story lines and engaging characters that break the mold of most anime tropes like Tsunderes (with Steins;Gate's Kurisu) and Moé characters (Re:Zero's Rem). The authors want you to see the MCs go through very difficult (and sometimes gory) hardships in order to reach their goals. In a nutshell both are:- Animated by White Fox- Time Traveling Related- Have fresh Non-Self Insert Protagonists- Mold Breakers of Anime Tropesand both anime titles have a thing for colons and semi-colons.  read more 
Butterfly effect 
Time traveling is always a popular theme for anime.But it is risky because it can cause a lot of plot holes.Then again those two anime don't have a problem about that at all.Both mc have similar goal and reason for using time travel again and again.Steins;Gate hasn't got any real fight scenes but it has much philosophical approach about time travel.Both are done by the same studio so animation style is similar too. 
Both anime revolve mostly around an ordinary guy who does his best to protect those he cares about, no matter how many times he has to do it:- Both Guys who are suddenly caught in a spiral of disastrous events- Both have something to do with the Butterfly Effect/Travelling back in time- Both MC's are pretty powerless and non-significant at first - Both MC's will stop at nothing to save those they care about  
Essentially similar concept. Re:Zero is basically Steins;Gate meets KonoSuba. 
Similar theme of live die repeat. In case of steins gate he doesnt get to do the dying part.-Both mc's start to lose it after a while.-A romatic relationship is slowly forming with the mc in bith shows.-Steins;Gate is more of a sci fi and re zero more of a fantasy anime.-Both can be very dreadful and life draining at times.-The ending is spectacular in both shows.All and all if you enjoy the one I believe you will enjoy the other one. Steins;Gate can be difficult to watch specialy early on but dont give up. The end is what matters. 
Re:Zero and Steins;Gate featured an MC with similiar power: time travel. And the 'time travel' aspect of these series isn't just some cool sci-fi material, it has a little dark element attached to it: 'death'. Both MC tried to save people around them from the hand of the reaper, they also touched upon the psychological aspect of the MC as the only one who remember the events from before the timeline is altered. Also, both series are produced by the same studio and have fantastic, fluid animation. However, while Steins;Gate is a bit slow on the beginning, Re:Zero show its dark element right on the very first ep. read more 
well, if i tell will be a spoiler, but just knows that both are good and the ""time travel"" envolving a friend is ""similar"" 
If you like watching someone getting desperate to save everything by some kind of ""time-travel"" you would love this show instantly. 
Despite opposite settings, both of these series feature time looping as the main plot device and strong character development, plus similar themes of selflessness and looking forward rather than behind. 
Both of these animes have the same theme of going back in time to save a life, but in one the person has to die in order to change time while the other simply has to microwave a burrito. Other than that the series as a whole seems completely different. 
Unlike Re:Zero, Steins;Gate a well-written time-travel thriller. If you think Re:Zero is good, then you clearly haven't watched Steins;Gate or Madoka Magica.  
“Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu” and “Steins;Gate” have the concept of going back in time. Problems are always arising for the main characters. Whenever they think they can catch a break, something around them has to go wrong. Furthermore, their mental state will be affected from seeing the people around them suffer. With that being said, these anime can have a very dark and serious tone. While “Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu’s” storyline is set in a fantasy world, “Steins;Gate” focuses on a real life aspect. 
In Steins;Gate the mc makes a time leap machine and the plot becomes saving his friend by time leaping. In re:zero, The mc also uses time leap to save his friends. In the both series, they need to figure the way how to save people. In rezero, by triggering specific events, meanwhile in Steins;Gate by redoing his actons.  
If you've seen them both then you'll know this is an obvious comparison.Slight spoilers for story premises here, but nothing that would ruin either for you if you haven't seen them yet.Both of these Anime are by White Fox, and have more or less the same story structure and premise: The main character has the power to rewind time somehow, and this interferes with the natural order of things. As such, they lose people they care about, and end up going back again and again, growing increasingly desperate, as they try to get the perfect result.Both stories have a great deal of intrigue and mystery to them as well and are, at least in my opinion, utterly unpredictable.Both well worth watching, I highly recommend both. read more 
Both shows have a very similar concept around them. Steins;Gate and Re:Zero are both produced by the same studio, White Fox. The main protagonists of both shows can act like goofballs at times, but become serious and dependable when it comes to helping others out. I don't want to say too much as it's best to go into both of these shows blind and I definitely recommend both of them. Steins;Gate and Re:Zero are both fantastic shows produced by White Fox though Re:Zero is very controversial at times. This is only my opinion though. 
the similarities1)same studio2)same topic- time travel3)both the MC travels time to save someone.4)both the MC are goofy but when the situations calls they become serious.difference1)Steins;gate is a science fiction while Re:zero is a fantasy. 
Time travel concept, similar animation styles and made by the same studio ( white fox studio). Both also have a complex plot and interesting story. 
Both have to do with going back in time to save someone they care about. The protagonists are both funny and goofy but have a darker tragic side. However,Re:Zero has more gore and takes place in a fantasy environment and Steins;Gate is more realistic. 
Someone at White Fox be like: ""You guys remember this anime about time travel we made few years ago, that everybody loved? Let's do that again!"" 
Similar in that both main characters have the ability to travel back in time ,and that they use that power to try to save a loved one. 
A goofy, but series when the time calls protagonist gets himself into a time travel loop where he must save his closest compatriot. 
-both are related to different worldline and travelling back time-both the MC are air headed but serious in tough situations-both MC travel back time to save someone-both shows have really cute girls... and interesting plot and twist.... 
Both start happy and lighthearted but descend into madness.The main character undergoes extreme stress, due to certain events.Both involve time travel and returning to the same time.The main guys have many similarities.Both involve a romance.Both have a cat girl named F(a/e)ris and a trap. 
- Both have dimensional travel- Dark elements.However, steins;gate focuses more on time travel as Re:Zero focuses on fantasy and dimensional travel.  
The vibe from both series are very alike; intense, hilarious and much more. The main characters are also very similar; they are not afraid to speak their mind to express themselves, and they often go out of their way to help other people. What's more similar is that both series deal with time-travel where the main character is able to go back into time to make better decisions to avoid similar incidents of occurring again.  
Great plot with time travel stories.A main character tries to save the person that he loves by the time leap. 
-Both feature hilarious protagonists-Both involve... hmm... how shall we say this without giving to much away.. A way of 'resetting'-Made by the same studio, similar art style-Start slow but reveal the truth later 
They both have time travel where the main character must go back mutiple times. 
- Mayushii always suffering- The local MC always suffering too but he lived from his checkpoint- Immature MC- Cringy MC 
In both anime the main character starts from the beginning each time he fails to save his beloved person, both see them die again and again in multiple ways and that experience takes its toll, They both lose hope at one point but someone gives them the courage to not stop and continue. 
Trime travel plays a major role in both animes. Rintarou Okabe and Subaru Natsuki are able to travel backward in time in order to save someone they care about. This time travel happens multiple times throughout the anime. 
-Both anime tell about LIVE - FAIL/DIE - REPEAT sequence.-Both main character try to save someone that important to them using time machine (for Steins;Gate) and using checkpoint (for Re:Zero).-Both anime contain a lot of emotion, especially desperation, fear, and love.-Both anime have most popular waifu (Kirisu for Steins;Gate and Rem for Re:Zero). 
Made by the same studio, Re:Zero may not be as great as Steins;Gate but many elements such as time travel and a wacky main character are still present 
Both Animes follow similar time travel theme where MC can go back and still remember the other timeline to accomplish a goal. I would also mention Madoka being in the same league. P.S. this is my favorite genre 
Both the series , the guys have an ability to go back to the past , in both the series the girls are targeted for their life , in both the series the guys go back again and again to prevent the deaths of their nakama , and in both the series they reach success but by passing through a long line of pain !! 
Two incredible series about time-travelling and the absolute chaos that attempting to change the past can do to one's psyche. They're both mature series with fantastic story-telling, characters, music, and art. Steins;Gate is in my opinion the superior of the two due to its superior story-telling and cast, but Re:Zero is fantastic in its own right. 
Carismatic main character that sometimes acts like an air-headed but it's not, at least not that much. Time traveling, deaths, same studio, interesting plot. 
The two main protagonists, Okabe and Subaru, work with time whether it is through a machine or an ability (There is more similarities with this. However, I will leave it a surprise.). The story revolves around take action and changing the future, otherwise known as the Butterfly Effect. Both animes are made by the same studios and are enjoyable to watch after the first few episodes. 
The male protagonists are very alike, as they share the traits of being humorous, caring, energetic, and emotional. The female protagonist believes in the male protagonist, which is something both anime share as well. Both shows have a lot of humor now and then, and they also have mysteries that the protagonists have to solve through thorough investigation. In the end, I honestly think that if you loved Steins;Gate, you most likely will love Re: zero as well. Not only that, they are from the same studio. The only difference between the two is the setting and the difference darkness between the two anime. Re: Zero is mostly the definition of Steins;Gate and the fantasy world. My favorite of this season, as I love deep and dark psychological anime. If you love dark and psychological anime, you most definitely will like this as well. read more 
Both have the same concept about going back in time to save the one you love and you will get the same in the end 
Both have almost the same concept of time travel. A guy who travel to past to save his friends from death.The idea is: if you liked Re:Zero, you might love Steins;Gate 
Before you click away because you're thinking, 'this can't be an accurate recommendation', just hear me out. There's only one thing that these two have in common: redo parts of life to save the ones you love.  It sometimes may seem impossible to keep on going, but keep trying and don't give up - this is the core message in both. So if you like these kind of underlying messages (like I did), you won't regret watching them. 
Both have persistent MCs that travel in the time to save others suffering in the process but without surrendering and always moving forward 
Compelling portrayals of despair and the growing feeling of madness and regret over one's actions repeated over a time loop. Also, both White Fox productions. 
Both are time travel series.Both have the concept of going back in time to save someone.Hilarious protagonists that are total air heads XDBut there is a difference in the way that use to return the time back in re zero he must die and return to chikpont its more like Gamebut in steins:gate they  Using scientific ways that are more realistic 
Same animation studio, time travel elements, quirky characters, psychological impact of tragedy on the characters.  
Rather than being able to time-travel, Re:Zero gives Subaru(Main character) the ability to ""reset"" time up to a particular point as soon as he dies.Similar to Steins;Gate, the main protagonists are both thrown in the dilemma of going through trials again and again to obtain the desired result. However, this journey of trying to get the best situation affects their character and drains them of their ""Humanity"" at some point.Events will unfold as their journey continues. 
Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu is probably the most popular anime released during the summer of 2016. From watching both Steins gate and Re:zero I've noticed how both the Main Characters go back in time some how to stop current events from happening. Steins Gate is by far the most confusing anime I've every seen, even episode 1 was very confusing, but everything makes sense when they explain it around the middle part of the series. If you are looking for romance in Steins Gate, then theres not that much at the beginning but there is quite a lot of romance towards the end. Steins Gate is also one of the most ""Feels"" anime I've seen. Be sure to check it out! I'd rate Steins Gate 9/10 read more 
It reminds me a little to re: zero only that the protagonist in my opinion is better developed.really the characters will like you, as much as its history.Thanks to this, I fell in love with travel in time.It is a masterpiece.I only saw myself this season, I have to see the rest but I'm content to see that end. 
Arguably the best time travel story I have ever had the pleasure to watch, Steins;Gate offers the time traveling thriller story with genuinely interesting characters without using as much gore as portrayed in Re:Zero.  
Same ""Time-Reset"" Mechanic and psychological Elements. 
Both shows are about how time travel has consequences, and can cause emotional stress for the time traveler. Re:Zero has more fantasy than science, but if you want a show to give you similar feels to Steins;Gate, this is the show. 
Both the MC have the chance to alter the future to save someone who is precious to them. 
In both of them, there is a time travel relation 
Both have a return to previous area plot device. If you are into an anime that involves going back into time then you are in the right place. 
Both share a high level of comedy and writing. But what really links these shows are the main characters. They start off with a (seemigly) happy MC surrounded by friends they care a lot for. Then said friends die. Again. And Again. And Again. Inability to change the past leads to worsening mental states as they begin fighting not only fate, but themselves as well. In Steins;Gate this only happens in the second half of the show; in Zero, it's the whole thing. If you liked Okabe's character deconstruction and are looking for something similar, then I highly recommend this show. Just beware, it's a very dark show, despite what the first few episodes might lead you to believe. read more 
Both are made by the same studio and involve constantly going back in time to change the future and save a character. Both MCs put up a facade of confidence to hide their insecurities (even from themselves). Time traveling in mentally taxing on both characters. 
Very interesting takes on ""time travel"" 
Both were made by the same studio, basically meaning there are similarities in the animation quality.Both of the main characters face the tragedy of failing to save the people they care about over and over again.Both deal with the usage of time travel. 
Firstly both anime is produced by the same studio. MC has similar time traveling related abilities. Author represents how both mc stuggles through hardship again again to save the person they care about. Both anime have it's beautiful share of characters that are loveable. Gives of a similar vibe even though both are not from the same genre! 
Plot Heavy and Time Travel or the idea of messing with Timelines is explored!  
Both shows follow their main character through traumatic events where they end up going back in time to fix their mistakes only to make more. As they attempt to fix all of their problems, they end up suffering from the consequences of altering history. 
Both animes have the main character attempting to save what he loves the most, and they both go through a series of serious torment, confusion and desperation in order to achieve his goal while the other characters are almost clueless on why the main character is acting different all of a sudden. 
To be honest since seeing Steins;Gate I have been looking for a psychological thriller along the same lines. With that in mind, now I've seen Re:Zero it's definitively in the same ballpark. Both have lead male protagonists that travel through time to try and save their loved ones while continuing to be effected by the pain of losing them over and over. The shows also have very well fleshed out character and story development along with a broad range of emotion. Many comedic, mysterious and dark tones make the feel of the shows to be parallel.  
Both have got time travelling and a protagonist who wants to save their friends and they are truly caring about their friends and cares nothing but their friends 
They both have time travel elements. Both characters go through similar revelations and events and have huge character development. Both are thrilling and I recommend you watch it if you love this. 
these two anime have a match in terms of the storyline where the main character is stuck in the failure of the rescue of the person he loves that makes this anime may be no different is the two anime is in production by the same studio 
I don't think there's anything similar to Steins;Gate but one of those shows that made me feel at least some of the feels i have with Steins;Gate is Re:Zero. It has a totally different way of traveling back to the past, and is amazing, i totally recommend it. 
In both Anime there are main caracters who can travel through time. To save their friends they are forced to make mentally depressing experiences.  
Both series focus on the protagonist who comes into a situation where he has time travel powers. Both Subaru and Okabe go trough a lot of suffering trying to overcome the obstacles they face. As the viewer you get attached to the characters and just really want both protagonists to succeed and find happiness and get an end to all their suffering. Eventually both protagonists find friends that support them no matter what, even if they don't know everything the protagonist knows. Like that Subaru manages to get trough thanks to Rem and Emilia, while Okabe is supported by Kurisu trough all world lines.If u like character driven time travel stories you'll definitely enjoy both steins;gate and re:zero. If you liked either one I'm pretty sure you'll like the other too read more 
Both of these animes had made me scared and excited while watching. If you like steins;gate you will definitely love re:zero. Both characters possess an incredible power about time and space. 
In Re;zero, the explanations are a bit lesser than Steins;gate but both anime have a same kind of thing. They both have Time-travelling things & changing the past type option. Both are very inspirational for people who thinks to change their past or wants to change as a better version of them selves. At the starting, you might not understand it fully & might wanna quit watching but take my reccomendation & continue watching to episode 18 in Re;zero, I'm damn sure it'll become one of your favourite anime. 
same studio, both related to time, both are rollercoasters of a ride (and can get pretty dark). Both are gureto 
Despite having very different settings, both series feature a similar plot structure in which the MC finds himself repeatedly going back into time to protect those he cares about. The MCs are similar personality-wise, and both series explore the psychological ramifications of failing multiple times. 
if you want an anime with perfect character development (and that contributes to their deconstruction later), interesting plot twists that leave you stuck all the time, an intelligent anime that makes you think full of hidden messages and the best protagonists of all times, steins;gate is the right choice 
Both shows are centered around the use of some kind of time travel (such as time loops) by the protagonist to save their loved ones; Re:Zero is basically Steins;Gate in an isekai. Both shows feature some amount of suffering, and they were both animated by studio White Fox. 
Both have main characters that travel back in timeBoth have main characters that suffer a lot throughout the seriesBoth have main characters that try to protect all of there friends Both have main characters that travel back in time to save a girlBoth have main characters with Chūnibyō personalities If your looking for a main character that's similar to Hououin Kyouma or Subaru check out either one. 
Both anime has similar type MC that suffers for saving his dear peoples.Both MC's are great & Masterpiece.Highly recommended anime and also must watch for you. 
Both involve time travel (kind of) and trying to save their friends and loved ones with it. 
In both animes the plot revolves around going a few days in the past to change future events. 
Both are fantastic thriller animesInvolve changing the pastThe main character suffersMade by White Fox 
-Both anime revolve around using time travel (time looping as the main plot).-Subaru & Okabe both go through hell to save their love ones. -Both protagonist are powerless and selfless because they’ll go through lengths to save their loved ones. -Both anime are animated by White Fox and have a similar premise  Steins;Gate & Re:Zero both have that dark gloomy and eerie tone to the story. However, Re:Zero has more gore and takes place is a fantasy world. Whereas, Steins;Gate is a SCI-Fi thriller and feels more realistic due to the art style and setting. Also, the fundaments of time travel is better explored in S,G.  read more 
The main characters both travel back in time to save someone or to prevent something. ya 
The plot is very sad and exciting, exactly like S; G, also the ""return to the past"" mechanics reappears present in -Steins; Gate 
Both main protagonists have time traveling related abilities. 
Both anime main charachters go the past about a day or two and having mental problems 
Both of those anime talks about that protagonist who go back in time over and over and over, to solve some problem will happen, and save himself and his friends.  
Both are about time traveling and life saving but one is simp other is Mad  
-both have the try over again and again kind of thing going on-both feature proper waifu material 
In these anime the protagonist has to suffer through repetition of  situations where their close ones are endangered or even die. The protagonist to find a way to fix the situation. Both involve time travel. 
Both Shows have the similar concepts People trying to make it past a certain situation that they are struggling to get past, both Protagonists have a ability to remember the past, Have loveable characters and world development. 
In both title, you'll see the main character go through some real deal. The support and other MC's are also a good complement to the story. 
In Both anime the male MCs has to go in the past again and again(and suffer a lot{specially in Re:Zero}) to save their love however one is scientifically developed story and the other is fantasy, But still if you are looking for well developed time travel stories this is where you should definitely go.    
Same psychological/mystery vibe to them. Both have some episodes which end with cliffhanger or plot twist. 
Steis;Gate and Re:Zero both deal with the similar concept of time travel in their own ways.Both are made by the same top tier studio and each do a great job at adapting their novel counterparts. I recommend both these shows for any fan of psychological and philosophical thrillers. 
1) Both male MCs can initiate time travelling(with the exception of some cases occurringaccidentally)2) Both male MCs initiate time travelling to help their friends (all female)3) Both TV shows have a female character which is very supportive of respective male MCno matter which world lines they are in (although they both hate the respective maleMC at the beginning of both TV shows but end up loving them, which is a classic plot) 
TIME TRAVEL  is possible in both and only main characters can do itBoth mc have 2 cute girls O_OBoth Mc sees the person they love will die and gonna save themBoth mc have same personalityAnd you love both anime 
it's like begin something from the bottom then fail and repeat or restart 
Let’s do more screwing around with time travel! That’s pretty much what goes on in Steins;Gate, in which a bunch of psuedo-scientists stumble upon a device that allows them to communicate with the past and alter the flow of history.But the goal of the cast here isn’t to prevent some major tragedy from occurring. Not at first, anyway. Eventually, all they’re trying to do is clean up their own mess, as their meddling brings all sorts of butterfly effect consequences to bear. 
- Both are involved with time- Both main protagonist- Both have big depression- Both have those hot girls ykOne difference is that one is a fantasy world and the other is in today's world so yeah I would recommend it if you like the other :) 
Both of these animes have a protagonist who can retry his recent actions in life. They are trying their best to reach the optimal ending, where no one dies.Re:Zero is an Isekai, Steins Gate is a Slice-of-life with sci-fi elements.Both have many bishoujo characters, they are partly harem-type. "
9253,1210,18,"The idea that a secret organisation, according to the protagonist, is conspiring against him is a similarity. At the same time both series are perverted and both have a somewhat weird/special female side-character. The main characters in both series also seems a bit awkward when trying to interact with 'normal' people, yet somewhat like a leader among their own small clique/group of friends (which seems to be a coding guy and the weird girl in both series). Besides that, they also have in common that reality seems somewhat off or twisted to the protagonist. There might be more, but this is my impression after the first episode of Steins;Gate :) read more 
The protagonists in both series believe in the existence of a secret organization that is out there to get them. Both shows display a good balance between comedy and darker themes. 
Both feature main protagonists who are slightly nutty, believe in some global conspiracy, and don't like to shave. 
Both anime has an evil Organization and both Male leads is somewhat obsess to it and having delusion about it.. and the female leads also helps the male leads to overcome what's happening both anime has a funny side and serious sides..  
In both shows, the male leads suffer from the delusion that a mysterious secret organisation is conspiring against him. The female leads seem innocent and pure at the first sight, but upon closer inspection they have their own tragic stories to tell.  
They are both great, have dark psychological humor, and leave you with a strange feeling of happy depression. In any case, they are both worth watching if you haven't seen either one. 
While ""Welcome to the NHK"" and ""Steins;Gate"" aren't all similar in overarching plot nor animation style, there is something about the ""normality"" of the two shows that can't be overlooked.Both are them are set in a realistic, believable world, without over-the-top characters. Dialogue is witty and sensible, and both start off relatively harmless, but eventually delve into the psychological drama type of anime. 
The early episodes of Steins;Gate feature a lot of jokes about otaku culture that would fit right in in NHK, plus both shows feature semi-insane main characters who believe that there are secret organizations plotting against them. 
Seto and Okabe are quite alike they both made up a conspiracy theory, they are both awkward to strangers, have a bit of a wrong view on the society and they both have their group where they can be themselves. These series have something big simular in the end but guess if I tell that it is considered spoiling. and except all of this, these are just 2 big masterpieces. 
Both feature conflicted over-the-top main characters overcoming obstacles. 
Both anime have a dark tone with romance added in. Also both have very funny dubs. 
Both anime have a good balance of comedy and dark themes.Both protagonist believe in the existence of an ""organization""Both anime also have a lovely, pretty and helpful female leads that the protagonists relies on, and they both have tsundere tendencies as well.They also have sidekicks who wear glasses....and although farfetched, the protagonists are also trying to be successful in creating something ( in SG, find a way back to the Alpha world line; in NHK, to create a video game)  
Extremely similar main male leads, both believing in existence of secret organizations that are after them, and both are pretty awkward when it comes to social interactions.Both anime start out in earlier episodes mainly focused on humor, but slowly shift into darker themes. 
The whole time I was watching Steins Gate I couldn't but notice the similarities between it and Welcome to the NHK. This is due to the fact that with very few changes the main characters are identical. In Welcome to the NHK the protagonist is a young man who invents a secret organization similarly to the one in Steins Gate. The characters share the same sense of humour and act in the same overdramatic way when they are trying to conceal their feelings or when they try to act with ""normal people"". Both of them have social problems, one being a NEET and the other one having been secluded until forming his laboratory. The difference stems from the level of intelligence and interaction with other characters. But even there are other similarities. Pure-hearted Girls and Tech Geniuses. They deal with different themes but both shine because of the very good charactes. read more 
Both feature a paranoid MC thinking they were involved in some sort of conspiracy (NHK) and hunted by an evil organization (Steins Gate). Both anime also have female leads that can understand and empathize with the protagonists and at the same time help them to overcome their problem. Just like Steins;gate, NHK  also starts off rather slow and static. Only starting to pick up the pace in the latter part where things get more serious.  
Both main character's are struggling from a conspiracyBoth stories are awesome! 
The protagonists believe that they're in a conspiracy, also most of the time they're in a room and many references. A good show can offer you these series. 
Delusional otaku protagonists that believe that a secret organization is conspiring against them, with realistic colors and characters designs, and some drama and romance.  "
9253,1535,15,"Both animes are about the main characters trying to change the world through unnatural means (Death Note / time travel). The protagonists Light and Okabe are both geniuses, but while Light is a self-confident evil mastermind, Okabe is a good-hearted 'self-proclaimedly mad' scientist with a fair bunch of ridiculous inventions. Both have clever plotlines that will always keep you on attention and at the edge of your seat, wanting to learn more. 
Steins;Gate are similar in the way that they both require critical thinking and your absolute attention for a clear understanding of what is really going on. Both these anime""s are dark, though Steins;Gate starts of with a lot of humour.Also, the voice actor of the main characters are indeed the same. 
Death Note and Steins Gate are very close in nature, you got the whacked out kind of genius in both series, and both main characters love playing with fire (figuratively speaking). If you're looking for an anime that has psychological thrills and don't feel like watching all of code geass these are some good options. 
I am a big fan of animes that require intelligent thinking, whilst the plots are not even similar, they both have a large sense of mystery as well as the ability to engage your mind! Both insanely brilliant animes that you're missing out on if you haven't watched them! Highly recommend on both sides. 
Both shows have characters of great intelligence. Both have characters that mess the laws of nature. DN with a god and this Steins;gate with a time machine. Finally, both shows aren't very gory. They show blood on occasion, however it isn't everywhere and their deaths aren't shown. In my own opinion, they are very interesting shows. Each have unique characters that makes the shows what they are, and I enjoyed them.  
Both series share a unique kind of way of looking at things. 
Both take place in present-day Tokyo and the protagonists of both rely on strategic thinking in order to accomplish their goals, chiefly by discovering and exploiting the rules of their newfound devices. Both also cover similar themes, such as ""be careful what you wish for"" and the ethical implications of a human having control over supernatural powers (for Death Note, it's whether one should have control over life and death; for Steins;Gate, it's whether one should have control over time).  
Ones a little more SciFi, the other is a little more Fantasy.  Either way, chances are, if you like Death Note you will like Steins Gate.Both center around brilliant, eccentric individuals who are tasked with unraveling mysterious occurrences.Steins Gate is a little more light hearted with more lovable characters; But, both have HIGHLY engaging plots for the curious sleuth or scientist in all of us. 
Can you change or hack the world? Or self-destruction without salvation.Both have very similar atmospheres and intelligent characters. Suspenseful and heavy dialogues.Light and Okabe want to change each worlds. Because of they have definite and faith purposes. So they never give up.In DN case, social issues are main theme. Psychological battle is unfold with supernatural elements. Extremely intense.On the other hand, SG is main story for save people. Everything is exist between morality and decision. Like reasoning.It is difficult to achieve something. However, if you have strong will, you can surely change someone's future.Yes. Don't look back past. Future is bright symbol for shine earth. These are personal opinion. But I'm sure them.That's why DN and SG are masterpieces. Not to mention regarding quality, and quite interesting content.Once again, I love both of them. As a observer, I hope their stories are pass down through next generations.If you wanna watch related to DN, I definitely recommend SG. Thanks for reading my sentences. read more 
The two anime are thriller wich have a lot of suspense. 
If you like the mind game aspect of Death Note I think you'll love Steins Gate. Bear with the series. This is one serie that starts out extremely slow. But just have faith. It gets really good. The start feels horribly slow, boring and meaningless. But in the end you will get why it's buildt like that. It will all make sense if you have the patience to get through the start. And when I mean start I mean the first 7-8 episodes.  
really gets your mind going, both are thrillers if you like the genre. 
Both shows excel in making you feel smart. (Big Brain Moments)Both shows become incredibly dark fast.

There are tense moments that will keep you on the edge of your seat, and there will be light-hearted moments where you can laugh. Either way, if you watch either, be prepared for one heck of a ride!Important note:The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya is only a movie you can only fully appreciate if you have watched the previous two seasons adapted before it. 
Both of these series start of quite light and humorous, before the real plot takes place. in both stories the protagonist has to use time travel to change the world to the way it originally was. Going through a lot of mental strain and hardships. 
Both Anime deals with time-travel, and the MC time-travel many times just so he can fix/save the world/time he came from, both anime starts off normally but it turns NUTS really quick and there's a lot of twist along the way, both series have amazing soundtrack & character art.......Over all both anime is one of the best anime I ever watched 
The plot lines are extremely similar because they follow a lone protagonist struggling through alternate or distorted timelines. Both shows do a great job of portraying the main character's thoughts feelings as they experience this dilemma. Both are brilliant pieces of work and should be watched not only be fans of Steins Gate and Haruhi Suzumiya, but by any fan of anime in general. 
Both shows have time travel and really keep you on the edge of your seat!! 
Both involves time traveling in order to restore the world line with very similar scenes that will give off vibes to the other anime. 
The plot of these two anime is very similar. Both deal with time travel and while one deals with other things such as aliens and espers the plot follows remarkably a similar line. This is a movie and you have to see the whole series beforehand. But when you are going to see the movie you will inevitably think of steins gate. 
Both Kyon and okabe must bear great burden to make everythings get normal. If you like story about time travel/time leap, I recommend to watch Suzumiya Haruhi no Shoushitsu and suzumiya series too.  
These masterpiece have a lot of similarities like time traveling, and has one of the biggest plot twist that I have ever watched, if you like some sci-fi that has something to do with time then I recommend you watching this amazing shows. "
9253,38329,7,"Both Shows deal with Time Travel and Despair. One is a movie and one is a series thereby the latter making it longer to reveal the secrets behind time travel. A story about second chances. 
Since Steins;Gate is way more known, i'll just say that I definetly felt a Steins;Gate vibe in Seishun Buta Yarou wa Yumemiru Shoujo no Yume wo Minai Movie, the first season of Buta Yarou must be watched before the movie ^^If you haven't seen Steins;Gate, just go watch it 
Plot is related to time and there is romance involved in both. 
-Both of them share a similar back-drop - Going to different timelines to change or alter the protagonist's relative present-Some scenes will leave you in denial, which is a good thing when watching a show of this sort-If you enjoyed the premise of either, you'll enjoy the other show too :) 
If you like time travel and sci-fi, then you would also find Steins;Gate enjoyableBoth anime contains time traveling in order to achieve goals. In Bunny Girl Senpai, it is more focused on romance, but if you're more interested in sci-fi, technologies, and something more intense, more emotional, you should DEFINITELY watch Steins;Gate. 
It has a very similar plot line with a main character having to use time travel to save the people he cares about. Similar themes of grief and dealing with loss are touched on. Keep in mind this is a sequel and requires watching the original series. 
Without spoiling steins gate, both shows have a main character while fully being aware of the weird things that have been happening around them, they both have a female figure that supports them throughout the series, and especially in the movie they both delve into the theme of time travel o alter a tragic future... "
9253,32281,6,"Are you ready for more timeline shenanigans? Steins;Gate is a more mature series than Kimi no Na wa, but both feature organic relationships between characters - both romantic and platonic - as well as a deceptively pleasant start. 
Both has mind-blowing story full with twists and turns, comedy, and also tear-jerking. And both end with bittersweet feeling that makes you want more.  
This a romantic story where the characters switch bodies and there is time travel. It is an excellent movie. You will never forget! 
Both are time travel anime with elements of romance that transcend time. 
Steins;Gate is a 24 episode series while Kimi no Na wa is a movie, and so the common plot point of time travel is fleshed out a lot more in Steins;Gate.However, it is the relationships between the main characters across both titles that create the strong emotions that keep people coming back to these two titles.  
Steins Gate and Your Name both mainly rely on the feeling of ""longing"" the kind you feel after a particularly good dream or about the one person that ""got away"" to build tension and maximize emotional pay off.They also both start slow to capture the audience's imagination and allow time for us to attach ourselves to the small cast within the storyMakoto Shinkai's thematic exploration of ""distance"" and the romantic conflict that comes from distance shows up prominently in Steins Gate as well to build HIGH drama and lets just say Steins Gate isn't one of the highest rated anime out there for nothingand yes trains do show up to serve as a metaphor for separation as well hella worth checking out read more "
9253,4181,6,"Both have the same sort of drama and similar feel at some point 
Both have incredibly well-developed characters, and deal with parallel dimensions. NOTE: Watch Clannad before watching After Story 
These animes give a strong feeling of love between two people, as well as the love in a friendship. So strong in fact that this love makes the characters overcome obstacles with it. At the end I guess they are just both very moving. 
firstly I just have to say you should obviously watch Clannad first before you watch the after-story.-Clannad after story and steins;gate are light- hearted and happy at the start- however they then gradually get more and more dramatic until you are practically on the floor crying your eyes out-the endings are brilliant and make you feel completely satisfied with life 
-Both have drama-Both have romance-Both have the main character thrown into serious depression because of the loss of anotherAt first this may seem like a weird recommendation, but I know a lot of Steins;Gate fans who love Clannad, and vise versa 
Clannad After Story and Steins;Gate are two anime series based on visual novels that deal with bittersweet romance. While Clannad After Story doesn't deal with time travel in the way Steins;Gate does, it does explore multiple timelines of Tomoya Okazaki's love life. In keeping with the spirit of the visual novel, the anime adaptation will show off the different ""routes"" that were available in Tomoya's life. After Story is a sequel to Clannad, however, so it won't be entirely welcoming to new audiences unless you've watched the original anime first. "
9253,13601,4,"Both anime are dark/realistc style, with good characters and some mistery.one is about time machine and the other about the mafia above the security system. 
    The worlds of Psycho-Pass and Steins;Gate are both science fiction worlds which each seems relatively realistic. They are also more serious with little or no comedy and have very good character development  
Both series are psychological thrillers that have rewarding payoffs as the series progresses. in both series, there is a greater system/organisation that has a secret that is slowly discovered as the series progresses. 
mystery oriented focus on science fiction likable cast and also unexpected plotwists "
9253,7785,4,"Both use the concept of different possibilities or realities really well.Steins;Gate is a bit more straightforward sci-fi.The Tatami Galaxy is more surreal. And strange. 
There are multiple time lines, and the main character is currently in the wrong attractor field (where the bad ending always happens) and trying to get to the right one (where he is happy). Also, the main character of Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei sort-of gets Reading Steiner. 
both are really well made, both deal with the butterfly effect and parallel worlds 
  Jumps in the time where each creates a parallel world, where the protagonist is the great affected, but their relationships are not affected by this change. They still exist despite being parallel worlds. The protagonist tries to reach his goal. In Tatami Galaxy this goal is simply to have a color pink life and in Steins;Gate, it is to stop an alleged conspiracy. The issue is how hard it is to get there by shedding their bucles or mental revelations. "
9253,38691,4,"Both have ""Mad Scientist"" MC 
Both have this science addict main character where they try to create every thing with science. 
Two mad scientists who are looking to save the world or make it a better place for everyone, both use different means to achieve this, containing rivals with completely different or opposite goals. 
- Both have a mad scientist protagonist- Throughout the story the main characters, Senkuu and Okabe respectively; attempt to change the world with their vast scientific knowledge. "
9253,13125,3,"They both have a mysterious feel to it, with a dark atmosphere and based around supernatural events.  
This might seem like a weird recommendation but both these series have the sort of story where the protagonist stumbles onward trying different things only to realize the error of his ways and the way the world works way later in the series leading to an epic finale.These two series don't feel the same but I can't help but think that if you like one you'll like the other. The pacing is similar in that it is slow at first but picks up speed constantly untill you're glued to the screen. There are even similar elements relating to memory (where one character has memories of something the others do not and is therefor isolated). The protagonists of both shows must face an overwhelming power on their own and while they have support from their friends it is not applicable to their situation some of the time.There are some people who might be bothered by how relaxed the creators of these shows are about gender roles or whatever. In Steins;Gate there is the trappiest of traps and in Shinsekai Yori there is a boy on boy kiss - something which has horrified the communtiy to no end. If this somehow disturbs you too much to be able to enjoy good anime then I recommend Mars of Destruction. read more 
Similarities : - MCs are strong mentally, and not physically ( they usually go through psychologically stressful situations)- Focused on a group of friends - Both have some romance- Interesting reflexions about the behavior of human society after a major event (time traveling/ humans with psychic powers)Differences:- Shinsekai is darker than Steins;Gate, with less humor and a heavier atmosphere (post-apocalyptic). - Both are science fiction anime, but unlike Steins, Shinsekai has this supernatural side to it.- Art & Sound are better on SY, while S;G has a better plot.For me they're both great shows, though I can't say for sure that if you liked S;G, you'll also like SY. I mean, these shows don't have a really straightforward connection, but a kind of weird, deeper one. So its possible to like only one. I'd say about 70-80% chance for someone to like the two of them, so, give it a shot ! =D read more "
9253,2904,3,"Both are very exciting anime, with lots of plot-twists, well-made and rich stories, great voice acting and lots of thrills.In Steins;Gate you get to see time-travel and all its effects on the human mind and its possibilities.While in Code Geass you see the ambition of a young man who gets the power to command anyone to do anything and manages to create an uprising against an empire (Britannia). 
Although Code Geass picks up immediately and it's engaging from the start, Steins; Gate manages to chill the viewer as you advance to the ending.  Some are relatively unaffected by the plot behind Steins Gate due to the resentment caused by some of the ""theories"", which are held to be true in the anime + they also abhor simplicity of the plot for those who are connoisseurs in the effects of altering not only the past but the future.  Nevertheless, I would think that many would enjoy how intricate the plot is - relative to most anime.  I especially enjoyed steins; gate due to its incorporation of the principle of how space-time is primarily affected by what you think, perhaps even an apparition.  The level at which the anime operates is similar to how Lelouch operates in its plots, albeit on a more profound level.  In no way am I saying that I honestly know what I'm talking about, but this is my first review, and I just wanted people who haven't started steins;gate yet to realize why it's regarded as such a good anime. read more 
Both mess with your mind and have amazing plot twists. Definitely recommend both. "
9253,1575,3,"Both share a main character blessed (or cursed) with a special power. Allowing them to change the world. Or try to... Awesome soundtrack, character development, an impossible romance, lots of plot twists, incredible seiyus (voiceovers). In the end you can't stop watching this after 4-5 episodes, you're hooked and need to finish it off =) 
Perhaps not the most obvious recommendation, those who appreciate an interesting concept spearheaded by an ultra-charismatic lead character will probably appreciate Code Geass and Steins;Gate. Both shows, while having several flaws, are probably the two best examples of an anime riding its narrative momentum to sail above their shortcomings. They are not the same in their concepts, but they are very similar in their goals regarding the impact it looks to have on the viewer. 
are two incredible anime that have a similar atmosphere. although the history is different you can easily compare the two "
9253,5081,3,"Both have extremely deep and interesting characters with many sides to their personalities. Both have elements of the unreal while keeping true to a very realistic setting. Both have great endings. Both are instant classics to viewers who are somewhat experienced in watching anime. 
Both Bakemonogatari (from the Monogatari series) and Steins;Gate are dialogue heavy and have little to no fight scenes, of which, personally, I really like. This means that you have to listen and recall a lot of what the characters say to understand the story to it's full potential, but if you are willing to do that then the payoff is pretty good.Bakemonogatari has a bit more of a darker, creepy atmosphere to it compared to Steins;Gate, which has a light and normal feel to it at first and then it slowly shifts into a darker mood.Steins;Gate is about time travel/multiple universes whilst Bakemonogatari is about apparitions and vampires. They both have a main character who is unique, and kind of crazy, and they choose to help solve other peoples problems using whatever means they can. Both of these titles are in my top 3 anime series (I gave both 10/10), which shows that I enjoy dialogue a lot. So, if you enjoy good story and dialogue, then these anime are for you. read more 
Both are works that both blend seriousness and otaku-related comedy well together. Both involve the harem relationships into the plot without making it the center focus or annoying like other harem ecchi comedies.  "
9253,2966,3,"Ookami to Koushinryou (Spice and Wolf) and Steins;Gate are similar in being both serious and humorous at times followed by the growing bond of relationships and the troubling events that follow. 
-Highly intellectual in many ways.-Intriguingly able to keep you on your toes at all times with suspense.-Both explain what's going on well so that the watcher doesn't lose track of what's going on even though things can get chaotic.-One is about time travel and the other economics, but the plot in both can get very thick. 
Spice and wolf is very good if a big part of what you liked about Stein's gate was the Romance and banter between the male and female leads and vice versa. Thier setting are very different (medieval Europe and modern Japan) as is what drives thier plot (economics or time travel) not to mention that spice & wolf more has a few very short arcs connected by the journey of it's leads than a main plot unlike Stein's gate. The banter and slow developing romance between the two leads are very charming and funny though (Spice and Wolf and Stein's gate are rivals for me for anime with best banter) and the association between the leads in both shows is reinforced to me at least by the male MC's sharing the same english voice actor (Lawrence and Okabe). Oh and a lot of the plots in the show are about medieval mercentile economics, don't worry too much if you have difficulty following that stuff as you should still enjoy it (I did). read more "
9253,30,3,"Both are mind blowers,if you want to change your perception of the world watch steins gate. 
Both shows are science-fiction supported by a strong emotional core, superb characters (some even sharing similar traits), skillful direction and visual presentation; a similar setting (by that I mean a blistering silver-white city in the summer), striking uses of color (and the lack thereof), as well as a strong emphasis on making the right choices at the right times. Both also do an excellent job of using their concept to push the themes they are attempting to convey.

9253,39587,3,"For the start, they were made in same studio (White Fox), beyond that, both have the same sadistic style; time travel (different ways in each anime) that torture them. If you liked Re: Zero, certainly you might like Steins;Gate. 
Both feature time travel elements and a protagonist that tries to find out the best route in order to save everyone he cherishes  
In a way, both anime incorporate the concept of traveling back in time, and in both cases, the protagonists use this power to try to save their loved ones. "
9253,10087,2,"Both these anime require the viewer to use their brain alot. The theme is very different but I think most people who likes one of these anime will also be a fan of the other.  
You may ask how these two anime are similar to each other. The answer isn’t very obvious. Steins;Gate same as Fate/Zero is one of my favorite anime so far. Since watching both of them. I’ve came to conclusion that issues are pretty similar. Protagonist are dealing with life existential issues. They’re looking for perfect world where they can exist without worries. Main characters are seeking for the truth that isn’t evident.For who I’d like to recommend watching Fate/Zero? Of course for people who are looking for dramatic experience based on character’s psychology. But all of you should give it a whirl. "
9253,37450,2,"quantum physics and eternal loneliness  
""Time"" is what's similar between these two. Steins;Gate is more of a science anime that focus on time travel in which the anime uses physical and supernatural means for time travel whereas Bunny Girl Senpai is more of a supernatural anime where the supernatural phenomenon and time itself, are two of the factors that build up the story. Both anime have an amazing story but Steins;Gate seems to be much more compelling objectively. They also possess emotional moments along with natural fanservice. If you're looking for compelling plots, I suggest these two anime. "

Both have very personal stories full with drama, mystery and deep philosophy. "
9253,2251,2,"While Baccano is not about time travel, I feel that people who enjoy Steins;gate should try out Baccano. It is bloodier than Steins;gate, but full of mystery and you get the thrill of understanding more and more each episode.

both are pretty confusing at the start but makes more sense as u watch it.both have supernatural theme "
9253,9989,2,"It's a surprise this isn't within the top recommendations. The art style is similar, creating an environment of surreal and  realism at the same time. Main characters are similar, with both main lead male roles fighting desperately against fate for the person they care about. Menma= MayuriDaru= HasidaAnju= Kurisu 
They are similar in that they show a look and the character's psyche/mental state. "
11061,5114,89,"Both are the best shounen in the world to me! They start off with adventures of a brave main character and go on into darker themes. Love the way the character opens and evolves throughout the story. 
Both series have an innovative and entertaining argument. The characters are so real; they are not the typical kick ass character. For that reason, the strategies are the most important at the moment of fight. 
Both have 'magic', alchemy and and aura, except with the former the source is external, latter internal. Alchemy is based off medieval historical musings, aura is modern parapsychology, but it also seems derived from Chinese Chi. In contrast, though, FM's antagonists follow the cardinal sins' tropes, which results in predictable behaviour based on past performance, whereas HxH has more unpredictable personalities and antagonists do not necessarily antagonize, although there is a central commonality in the origin of both when it comes to how they came to be. FM is more action-oriented, HxH more psychological. 
Both are remakes of two of the greatest shounen anime out there. What makes these two shows stand out from the majority of the shounen genre is that they have well developed characters along with a consistent plot. Also, there are absolutely no fillers in either of them. 
These two is an example how the shounen anime should be..Borrowing a quote from one of review I saw in MAL, the shounen animes should be like these, intelligent but exciting ... 
Both FMA: Brotherhood and Hunter x Hunter (2011) are series that have great story plots involving many characters. The characters themselves are well developed as each episode progresses. Additionally, there are themes of vengeance, friendship, honor, and pride that are explored many times throughout both series.The main male protagonist from both series has a cheery attitude but is always willing to help others in need by putting themselves in danger to protect in what they believe in. There is also a fictional dangerous group in both series who serves as primary antagonists. Among those antagonists are characters who have diverse personalities.These two series are considered shounens but are presented in a different way that is appealing and holds strong sense of value through its plot development. There is also great humor, catchy scenes/dialogues, and emotional moments that are memorable.  read more 
Both are shounen with darker, more mature themes. In both stories, the main characters are on a journey to find something and meet many different (interesting) kinds of people along the way. 
Both are about friendships and brotherhood (duh), are actually are very, very good shonens (some of the best anime overall), and don't have many typical/cliche moments.Oh and one more things: Characters actually die! 
Both are remakes that don't have fillers or meaningless fighting and rely more on strategy and wits. 
Great story with no cliche stuff. Both similar as they talk about friendship/brotherhood.Equivalent exchange is an important aspect of the story.  
I found the suspense, character development, and driving story that are very similar to each other kept me glued to both the whole time. You definitely need to watch them both to understand. 
Being both not-just-regular shounen, they're pretty much similar in the way they use the element of suspense, which is marvelous in both of them. Also alike is the use of comedy. They also resemble each other in the way they treat of matters such as values and life itself, and each of their corresponding main characters have a particular personal goal. Oh, and they've both had a previous animation work before they had even ended (Fullmetal Alchemist) or gone far ahead of the script (Hunter x Hunter).Personally, this are my two favorite shounen. 
They're both the most mature and clever shonens out there. It's not all about fighting,and that's why Fma and HxH are completely different from the regular shonens. The character development is amazing. Hunter x Hunter 2011 character's design seems childish,but the plot is dark,serious and full of suspense,just like Fma. They're both remake with no fillers. One more thing: characters actually DIE! without resurrection bulls*it. 
Both anime incorporate strategies and tactics into their fight scenes. Characters are similar as they travel and take their journey in order to reach their goals while becoming stronger along the way. Lively, bright, optimistic characters with supernatural powers. Two very brilliant animes that will not disappoint.  
Both series are top grade battle shonen that are plot driven, have no fillers and have a great cast of characters to boot! If you are a fan of good  storytelling and fights that focus more on brains and less of brawns, then you definitely can't go wrong with HxH 2011 or FMAB. 
The characters in both of these anime are trying to become stronger and have a goal they are trying to reach. 
Hunter x Hunter and FMAB are both very smart series and set themselves apart from most of the Shounen genre. They both share similar principles such as the infamous equivalent exchange and to gain you must give. The fights in both of these series also aren't just about who's the strongest or has the most will power and the one who's smarter and uses the best tactics  will usually win.  
Two of the greatest shounen anime; both of them are really addictive. Both consist of a unique superpower: alchemy in FMA and nen in HxH. The difference is that HxH's antagonists are more likable than FMA's. 
The two shounens to be built in a mature way make the viewer is caught in strong and very beautiful plot, besides the production of the two animes are equivalent, if you're a fan of one, is sure to be another fan :)) 
Detailed, tactical fights that need brain and brawn. 
They are not the typical shonen where you win through the power of friendship and struggles not good draw strength for a final attack and always beat the bad guys. These two are more realistic shonen. 
Both Anime have well-polished story, action, bunch of emotions, character progression in MCs as well as in side characters. They explain how things work in their ""worlds"" leaving annoying plot-holes away. If you enjoy action and adventure anime you should watch these!  
The anime has both protagonist that are badasses. Both shows are really good that makes you smile. And protagonists are really strong at a really young age ( both are fast learners ). 
If you have something, keep it, or someone more tactful will get it from you.Remakes that will change your point of view from typical relationships (I mean the brother relationship and friendship.) They will open your eyes at the things you have to know at every situation and one more thing, BOTH THEM HAVE PERSISTENT MAIN CHARACTERS that will never give up.  
Both have similar qualities, like both are Coming of Age type stories, but both take place in a world that is alive with other characters. Both involve the protagonist having to get a certification allowing them to pursue their MacGuffin, and during/after their acquisition of the certification, they uncover a plot or scheme. It's fairly good. 
One of the best shounen/action anime with great plot and reasons behind wvery battle. Great animation and the battles are strategic instead of pure fighting. Also there's almost no fillers 
- Both of them are masterpiece- They've got great, original story- Both of them contain great fighting scenes 
As these two are both shounen series, they are both exciting and makes the audience engage with its amount of elements hidden. These two series provide character depth and their storytelling are both well-made and helps move the story along. 
Both series are heavy on both character development and the relationships between said characters. 
Two of the best damn shows I've ever seen, with large casts of complex characters and stories that put the journey before the destination.  
Both anime tackle similar themes- typically intelligent and dark ones. Both anime as well focus more on battle tactics, rather than just full-out attacking. Both main characters have lost something they want to get back: Edward Elric wants to get his and his brother's bodies back, while Gon wants to find his father, and this makes both protagonists to carry on trying to find what they wish to find. Both anime are remakes, and many characters actually die. 
These are two of the best anime ever made. Both are very epic Shounen anime with lovable characters and captivating powers. Both anime are remakes and leave little room for fillers.  
Amazing and relatable characters, beautiful animation and sountracks, and too many moments of happiness, tranqulity, fear, anguish and sadness, all of this in two exceptional and well-written stories. 
Hunter x Hunter (2011) and Fullmetal Alchemist:Brotherhood may not have many similarities when you first look at the two, but to me I have to say they are incredible and if you've seen one, you must see the other.Hunter x Hunter (2011) is the story of Gon Freecss trying to find his father, while Fullmetal Alchemist:Brotherhood is the story of Edward Elric trying to find a mythical stone. Both have simple and slightly selfish ordeals for their own benefits, but as the stories progress and the characters grow up the plot advances and both Gon and Edward become the center of an alliance that are fighting against a world threatening entity. (I can not say too much due to spoilers). Gon and Edward are the main characters, as well as their partner, Gon's being Killua and Edward's being his brother Alphonse. This is a partner that never leave's their side. The stories have several other similarities, all that are the subject of spoilers and so will not be mentioned. The overall enjoyment from these two series was extremely equal, the climax of the series was extremely fun to watch and in both series every character is written beautifully and is given the perfect amount of time to become likable and evolve. To anyone who has seen Hunter x Hunter (2011), you should definitely consider Fullmetal Alchemist:Brotherhood. To anyone who as seen Fullmetal Alchemist:Brotherhood, I highly recommend Hunter x Hunter (2011).If you give both the series a shot as  I am fully shore you will enjoy which ever you chose to watch respectively.  read more 
Both are shounen packed full of suspense, action and emotion. While HxH is longer it had more of a open ending than FMAB, which had a more definitive ending to its story. These animes will make you laugh and cry, and at the end of it all you'll be simply awestruck.Both anime have great art and music, features two MCs and depict a massive crisis in their own way. One you start watching, you just can't stop!! 
Both series are well writen (not like this recommendation), well animated, great songs and great caracters. Probably one of the best shows you can find if you like action with well thought fights and great arcs. 
Both series have a great evolving long story about winning with not just only power but also with strategy. the anime's both have monsters in them and are some good  high rated' anime's. 
Okat this isn't exactly the same as Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood but really close when it comes to a good story telling. The characters Gon and Killua reminds me of Ed and Al, Gon and Killua also go through many hardships together and they make many sacrifices along the way. Abit longer than Fullmetal but worth it. 
Both are outstanding animes in all categories. The art is impressive, just like the storyline. In my opinion, they are a ""must watch"". Don't let the lenght fool you, Hunter x Hunter will get you hyped even after you finish it (just like Fullmetal) 
Both are not your typical shounen fighting superpowers. Both main characters have some sort of major influence from their father. Both have similar characters, themes, and can overall be an emotional experience. 
If you have watched one of this two masterpieces I'll tell you why you have to watch the other:*Incredible storytelling*Deep emotions*Charachters that you won't forget*Very beautiful animation*Great soundtrackIn short, both animes have everything that a good anime should have(action, drama, comedy,...) 
Well both involve relatively large worlds being discovered by the two main male characters (though HxH's is more colourful imo) and both have a large cast that get developed throughout the course of both shows (though certain characters may not be as developed as much as you'd want them too) and both crescendo in large scale battles that involve most of the cast ending with half (or an entire episode in FmaB case) where they give us a 'where are they now' segment.  
FMAB is slightly darker, but both anime share the same adventure style and comedy with a similar sort of style. They both involve a young, male protagonist, and their determination for their individual goals. Lots of interesting/ slightly odd characters and creatures that feature in both. 
I consider these two anime masterpieces. Both have great characters, development ( both that of character and story), interesting fights , great music themes, ops and eds. I thought that Fmab and hxh would be the typical shounen, blabla, bright adventure etc: I was fucking wrong, both can be dark at times. The protagonists aren't overpowered. One thing you wouldn't like in hxh though: Unfinished :S 
Both are very serious stories with MANY characters who are all fleshed-out, many amazing arcs, great animation, and a very good soundtrack to back everything up. 
I've seen anime with more similarities between each other, but these two definitely share common traits. First of all, they can both make you extremely furious regarding all the death happening around, even though most dying characters are supporting characters. With that said, I would say Hunter x Hunter was better in many ways, especially by concealing its true nature. The main characters also have this, well, to say, a ""childish"" goal of either finding or restoring something regarding their own family member. Along with that, both of their fathers are ""big shots"", and their sons are young, unique talents who inherited those traits from their fathers. Also, the makers both know how to make the last battle long, showing everything happening with every individual involved. You get pretty tense and even exhausted. Not only that, but in both cases the characters have to plan things out so carefully that you get scared of what'll happen. Both are worth a watch! read more 
 Both anime revolve around a protagonist in search for something and going out to an adventure, involving magic, action sequences and darker themes, which become a bigger part of the story in later episodes. 
Well i dont know any anime fan who hasnt watch any one the 2 both are incredibly good but hunter x hunter will probably never be completed since the mangaka stop writing but the anime in this case is still awesome and fullmetal alchemist brotherhood is a must watch u never get boring watching it at least i didnt. Enjoy 
Well developed and realistic characters, expertly crafted storyline, very focused plot, no filler and minimal fanservice. Where FMA follows two brothers on their quest to reclaim what is lost, HxH focuses on four individuals in their search for what is dear to them. Both series follow the adage: what's learnt on the journey holds more value than that which you search for. This is neatly summarised in HxH's final dialogue: ""you should enjoy the little detours to the fullest, because that's where you'll find the things more important than what you want."" Both series will rip your heart out and affect you in ways you least expect, guaranteed.  read more 
Two of of fav animes ever, both adventures that you will get hooked on within the first few eps :D. 
Standing Ovation to both productions! 5 out of 5 stars. 10 out of 10, A+, 100%Both shows being two of my favorites on MAL, I consider them not just adventure stories, but odysseys. Edward and Alphonse are on an odyssey to recover their bodies, Gon is on an odyssey to meet his father. As I am a proud adoptee, I love that not only are the main characters adopted, but that there are so many older characters who try to take Ed and Al and Gon respectively under their wing as their sons (Mae Hughes and Roy Mustang with the Elrics, Leorio and Kite and Morel with Gon Freecs). Kudos to those characters!Everyone has already mentioned the similarity between both series' main characters, I completely agree. Al acts as Ed's foil, Killua acts as Gon's foil. I also love the fact that not only did my fav voice actor Keiji Fujiwara voice Leorio and Col Mae Hughes, but those two look so alike with the tall, dangly, be speckled, cool guy look. So cool! I thought most of the similarities to each show happened during H x H Chimera Ant arc because both arcs are coincidentally similar length (about 65 episodes), both coincidentally share voice actors such as Roy Mustang and Knov, but also these are the most famous arcs in anime repertoire. Both massive arcs explore in their own writing what it means to be human by outlining examples of what it means to not be human. The Chimera ants are humanoid and quite complex, but are not humans (they seemed beyond the humans in power). The Homunculi are also not humans though they blend in so well, and they like Chimera ants look down at humans in power. The climaxes of both arcs comes after waiting 30 episodes and boy do they deliver. Fights are all cerebral, not just flashy visuals. This trope is probably influenced by Jojo's Bizarre Adventure fighting mechanics. This keeps all the battles psychological, and unpredictable to the audiences. In other words, both series take to heart that Power level alone does not guarantee victory, it is always the most intelligent fighter that wins. Music is phenomenal and memorable in both series. Much like how Jojo's or DBZ aged so well as anime and manga that they later inspired or influenced later generations of anime writers (coincidentally, these productions were influenced!), I see that it is only a matter of time for these two shows to age ten or twenty years before they influence the next generation of writers.To sum up both series in an adjective that gives the shows justice has failed me. I think good adjectives might be magical, inspiring, masterpieces. read more 
This anime is similar to Hunter x Hunter, but not as good as HxH, anyway I recommend it to you guys. The climax of both are very similar, the production is excellent and the plot is also great. 
Primarily it's amazing how both shows slowly get darker and darker, smoothly becomes what it doesn't seem from the cover. Both shows have brilliant character development, it's really really surprising how good it actually is. There are more similarities, but for the sake of your potential upcoming experience with the show...my recommendation will refrain from spoiling. 
Both series have a similar stories to tell. Where one puts in a world of alchemy, the other puts you in the world of nun, which has its own rules and restrictions. Both series are well received by the community for good reason, and I highly recommend you check the other out if you haven't yet. 
Along with these powers can come a strong darkness. Where is the line drawn as to how far these powers will be used for selfish conducts? Is being the most powerful being what is important?Both anime are adventurous. They start off on a similar note as to starting an adventure. It is for the search of something, FMA to a philosopher's stone and HxH to Gon finding his father. Both have overpowered supporting characters. 
Very similar feel to the world, and the aesthetic is mildly similar between the two. A pair of teenagers wander the world in service to an objective that becomes murky over time as they are swept into a grander plot with the fate of the world at stake. They are both spectacular shows as well, as seen in their MAL aggregates. 
A young prodigy leaves his hometown in order to achieve his goals. During his trip he meets allies and enemies with unique personalities and habilities and he will struggle to become stronger. The final FMA:B arc is somehow similar to the Chimera Ant arc from HxH. Action scenes where tactics are more important than power, drama and casual comedy in both. 
- Both Battle Shounen Anime- Both are about Friends and teamwork- Dark stories- Suspense and character Buildup are similar 
These anime got great animation and what the good of these both anime is the story, the fighting is so good, and the adventure is totally amazing and intense. The Hunter X Hunter is about finding the father of the main character who become a legendary hunter and the Fullmetal is two alchemist seeking for philospher's stone for a certain reason (i will not spoil the anime of course...) 
First recommendation so i'm keeping this short. ~Both deal with Main Protagonist having a goal they want to achieve~Both anime has intense battles along the way~Both anime's storyline is amazing Edward wants to get his body back While GON wants to Find his father and become a hunter. 
Two wonderful works that perfectly fit the definition of ""genre deconstruction"", both being considered as shounen animes, but delivering much more than that. 
Both are the best shounen in the world to me! They start off with adventures of a brave main character and go on into darker themes. Love the way the character opens and evolves throughout the story. 
The way the two animes work the series of events and how they explain everything that happens in relation to the powers and they do not keep hiding facts and creating things of nothing like other animes that exist by there ... At last they are also a type of anime that Should be taken seriously that impact scenes should be caused at the correct time and not just the lack of a plotSugerir uma edição 
Both feature excellent power systems (Nen/Alchemy), enjoyable and somewhat dark plots, excellent character development, and both sides have an incredible sense of adventure. The characters on both sides are excellent. If you want another nerve-wracking adventure series like HxH, FMA: Brotherhood is the go-to anime. Overall, however, HxH is more touching and has better world-building, while FMA: Brotherhood hits a perfectly good storyline in a lesser number of episodes. 
When it comes to consistency of episodes, quality of writing, the premise of the characters, and the majority of episodes that relate to the story intself, these two anime are shounen anime when done right. With the fights being logical as they both have unique power systems, it really shows out compared to some of the more popular shounen anime out there. The characters for both series all have understandable issues, and both series treat their characters right. Overall, these two may not seem that relatable, but when it comes to quality of writing and consistently, these two show a majority of that.   
They are both really good TV shows. If I had to pick between Hunter x Hunter and FullMetal Alchemist: Brotherhood to put in #1 so far on a top 50 list, I would have a really hard time. Definitely check out Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood if you like Hunter x Hunter 
The story at the beginning is light then as time goes by the plot is getting serious. Both MC has a title in the community like an Alchemist or a Hunter. Powerful villains and side characters. Fun to watch. 
Both have great main charactersAlso searching for something 
Both series have depth in their characters without leaving the plot 
- Both anime embark on a grand adventure- Main Characters of both are generally comedic, but get serious when necessary- Both have extremely well animated and meaningful action scenes- Both have disturbing and tearjerking moments- Both push the limits of the shounen genre 
FmaB and Hxh 2011 both tackle darker themes and subvert shonen tropes. In both shows the characters go on a long journey to find something important and on their way encounter interesting viallins. Also in both shows strategy and comparability is way more important in combat than raw strength. 
Both are different from generic shounens with a unique storyline and good character development. 
Both are shounen anime that could be classified as seinen (IMO) because of how deep the story is. Both animes are rare masterpieces from the mediocre sea of anime. A must watch would definitely raise your standardsP.S Before watching both of these anime, I find Naruto ""ok"". After watching these anime  I find Naruto garbage 
Both are well written and have superb entertainment all the way. 
Both have young male protagonists that have had fathers absent from their lives for a very long time. The main battle system does not just consist of punching people really hard, most of the time. Having both nen and alchemy being some of the best battle systems in the genre.  
Both are the peak shonens. They don’t have a similar story in fact they’re so different but I have enjoyed them the same and both are rare shonens that I gave 10/10. 
Both are about two youngs boys that are going through adventure that eventually becomes dark and dangerous. And both are simply the best shounen anime ever made! (At least for me) 
Out of all the anime I've ever watched, two have always stood out- Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, my 2nd favorite, as well as Hunter x Hunter (2011), my all-time favorite. These masterpieces both have an astonishing, unpredictable plot line, extremely well-developed characters,  and will both suck you in as well as leave you sad after finishing. (Plus, their soundtracks are pretty dang amazing). If you liked Hunter x Hunter OR Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, I can almost guarantee you'll like the other one- and not just because they're kind of similar. 
Masterpiece dos shounens 
Calidad, género y trama buenísima 
FMA Brotherhood I'd say is similar to HxH because of the genre both the series are in. Anyways, both shows executed with excellence would recommend watching before you start with others. (Just to get a taste of high quality y'know lol) 
Both are as dark as it gets and also two of the most flawless and well written very very engaging stories, with everything from ops/eds to osts to voice acting as good as it gets 
The same type of Shounen, with an interesting story and good characters 
these are both good in many ways such as fighting,story,plots and both have good pace both have good in depth characters, i would recommend this to any on that have started watching like me  
Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is without a doubt one of the greatest shonen of all time. It touches on deep themes just like hxh. In my opinion hxh is the greatest shonen and FMAB and OP are the only others that come close. 
These two are similar because they both have epic fights scenes, great characters and a good plot they both have powers, Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood has the power of alchemy and Hunter X Hunter has the nen power,both are great animes! 
Shounen and super powers are commmon in both of them, though HxH wins when you start judging on the basis of character depth. FMAB is good, but not as good as HxH, just watch it bruh 
Starts off kind of light-hearted but progrssively gets darker in absolutely perfect way. 
both are great shows with deep themes and fantastic characters and similar(ish) tone "
11061,21,55,"Personally i'm a huge OP fan since more than a decade and i have to say that it took me a while before actually giving a try to HxH 'cuz i wasn't sure if i would've liked it.. But. Woah against my expectations i really did like it more than i thought! Truth is that after i gave it a try, i couldn't stop watching it. The more i was seeing it and the more it was giving me the same feeling that OP gives me. They have the same vibe and have the power to let you enjoyed more and more, this way your curiousity level also grows bigger and bigger by each episode. They really share a lot in common:• first off: well, the genres, as you can see they both are Shonen, Adventure, Action, Superpowers genres.• both main charas would look the ""typical protagonists of a shonen serie"" but they actually are able to surprise you, the more you get to know about them and their personalities.• interesting enough, both protagonists' fathers seems to play a very important role (i would even dare to say ""legendary""), plus obviously are very strong and full of mystery• both stories are about dreams and all that takes to our main charas to realize them. In HxH, obviously, Gon wants to become an hunter; while in OP Luffy wants to become a pirate, but not just a normal one, he wants to become THE pirate King. In addition, their companions of both Gon and Luffy also have an ambition/purpose they want to achieve as well.• both series face the adventure with a long Journey splitted in many arcs.• still, both give a huge importance to friendship.• let's not forget to mention that both of them are quite cured, as of course, like the protagonists, also the other characters in the series are intriguingly developed for the best together with their backgrounds, their actions and personalities.• last but not least, the presence of the superpowers genre won't disappoint you either because ""from big powers come big... battles!"", yes, indeed lots of cool battles and the more you find out of the stories and the more you'll get interested by the way to fight! In HxH we have the ""Nen"" (Aura) and in OP we have the ""Haki"" (Ambition).. you'll really be amazed by the coolness of the battles!As you can see a lot of stuff is a common point for those two series.The only thing left me to say is: I seriously recommend both series, because they both worth it.If you liked one of them, you'll probably love the another as well.Because afterall, they both share one last significant thing: greatness. read more 
Gon and Luffy have similar personalities.Characters all have their own fighting style that they work on through the series, as well as their own goals. They both go through several arcs where the protagonist grows little by little. Both are on-going shounens. 
Both have a young boy leaving home to explore the world and become the best in it, they both have dreams they would sacrifice their lives for, happy positive outlooks on every situation, a selection of nakama/friends who they would do anything to protect.Both have comedy, action, fighting, adventure, challenges, friendship and a feel good vibe. If you're a one piece fan i definitely recommend hunter x hunter, and vice versa. 
An ambitious and particularly strong young boy setting on a journey in a vast mysterious world, full of unexplored lands and strange creatures. There he meets friends and face various dangers and enemies in order to fulfill his dream.I would say that One Piece is more about adventure while HxH is more about battle. Maybe HxH is a bit darker too, and OP funnier, but both are great shows. 
Both anime are similar in the themes of adventure, comedy and friendship.The main characters are also similar in personality, with Luffy being more silly than Gon. There are also lots of interesting side characters and powers presented in both shows. 
The adventure,comedy and feelings are all the same. Fighting for the nakama's by putting your life in danger. Its a must watch if you loved One Piece.Everyone have different powers like in one piece there are devil fruits.I don't know how to recommend anime's but I'm sure you will love Hunter X Hunter if you loved One Piece.  
Gon and Luffy are very similar protagonists. They go on an adventure and make many friends along the way. The feeling of adventure that One Piece conveys is also found very often in Hunter x Hunter. Both shows have a vast world that draws you in and makes you want to learn more about it. Both shows can become much darker than a traditional shonen at some points. If you like One Piece, it's almost certain you will like Hunter x Hunter. 
Both series are long running (lots of episodes) series that center around action and fighting. The main characters are very good and the stories are very profound.  Both characters have lost their families and are on a quest to become the strongest. They have to struggel and give their all to achieve this, wich is why the series is so amazing to watch as you can see them develop episode after episode. 
These are Jump's two greatest ongoing battle shonen. Both have massive worlds filled with numerous unique and like able characters. Both revolve around adventure and a charismatic MC that gains many allies along the way. If you are a fan of shonen (hell, if you are a fan of anime) then you should watch both of these. 
Both are shonen anime that each have their fair share of adventures and fights. Both series have hyper, dumb, and funny main characters that are very interesting. The art in both series is also done very well. 
While One Piece starts a lot slower than HxH (I'd recommend picking up at the Water 7 arc if you're impatient), and while its overall world and magic system is a lot more crazier and cartoony, it's definitely got the same sort of landmark effect on the heart, with tons of emotional moments, epic fights, characters that stay with you, and arcs that only get better and better as you go on.  
Both main characters (Luffy and Gon) are looking for something in particular and it is said at the beginning of the series.Side characters have somewhat similar goals. This can be seen mostly with Leori and Nami since they both want money. 
-Both shows (in my opinion) start off decent and get better and better to the point of awesomeness. -The concept of nen and haki are similar, plus both are introduced later on in the series. -They are your typical shounen anime where the protagonist protect his friends and get stronger. Both have superpowers(main characters are very strong and op, altho luffy is more op then gon) -characters aren't that similar but the relationships between characters are- Both have the friendship theme, though it's more present in one piece-both are currrently airing and prob won't end anytime soon 
Both anime are filled with adventured arcs consisting of interesting development with characters and introducing new foundations of abilities each character posses. This is a must watch! 
The best Battle Shounen already created. The best seller! Absolutely no one overcomes this One Piece. What enchants me most in this anime is a story that is exciting making you reach the point of tears. Its plot is perfect, everything connects, making their fans create several theories about the story. His universe is infinite, thus making it all happen or anything appear following its own logic.His pace is slow and it is one of the causes of many episodes, but worth every minute spent with this masterpiece. Another strong point is the comedy that will surely make you a good laugh. 
the main characters so much alike....luffy and gon they both are innocent and well their personality is extremely alike....they both are in a hunt while gon is looking for his dad,luffy is looking for the treasure,and there are awesome adventures...while luffy has a crew with their own goals in one piece,gon's friends also have their own seprate goals but somehow they get along... 
Gon, the main character, has some very strong similarities to Luffy when Luffy gets serious and the variety of powers and abilites of characters in this anime is similar to One Piece's devil fruit power variety. There are some AWESOME fights in this anime just like in One Piece and you will feel connected and cheer for the characters just like you do for the Straw Hat crew. Hunter x Hunter 2011 and One Piece are my two favorite anime. Please this anime is a great use of your time; it wont disappoint.  
After watching the masterpiece one piece the only other thing that gave me the same feel was no other than hunter x hunter. In both of the anime the protagonist is a reckless guy who goes out on a journey to gain something that they want. During the adventure both of the protagonists meet many different kinds of people and go through different experiences and learn from that. Both of the series are extremely enjoyable and are worth watching. 
Originating in shonen jump, and serialized practically a year apart, both mangas have been adapted into successful long running animes that have an excellent cast of characters, world building, and fantastic adventures.They both still have plenty of stories to tell in an ever expanding universe, while still keeping pretty consistent rules previously established, power levels, foreshadowing, never forgetting characters, and building off of the huge casts to create more amazing arcs. Most of the time, both shows are character driven.While both are shonen, both are so tonally different, yet they go in hand in hand with the way they blur the two sides of good and evil - Hunters being hunters, seeking out everything the world has to offer, and pirates, going against all odds to find what it truly means to be free. One Piece and Hunter x Hunter (2011) both are written differently, but in a way still have a lot in common. I guess the closest thing I can compare them to are Peanut & Butter haha. Anyways, give both of these stories a watch and even if they may not hook you quickly, stick with it and it'll be worth the wait. Don't skip arcs because a lot of tiny details said maybe even 50 or 100s of episodes ago usually turn up 200x more important in the long run. read more 
If you liked the odd as hell character designs and straight forward plot in One Piece then your'e prone to enjoying hunter x hunter 
Both anime create a huge world with many fantastic aspects from wild creatures/people to unusual places. Hunter x Hunter is shorter but has higher quality episodes whereas One Piece spreads itself over God knows how many more episodes but does not loose in telling a great adventure story. Both give you different emotions (joy, sadness, thrill, hope) overtime as you become part of the main crew. One Piece might be harder to start due to the number of episodes but every arc is worth it in the end. Enjoy Watching! :D 
If you are watching one piece you will really like hunter x hunter also. Both anime have incredible good characters voices and both have badazz old man that will make you cry of badass-ness xDDNETERO WHITEBEARD etc 
They are both about adventure and the main character is young boy who's a simpleton. The second main character is the cool one  who's not afraid to kill. Also the main character ,Gon, shares a lot of similarities to Goku and there's a ton of DBZ references in Hunter x Hunter. The Best part about Hunter x Hunter and the reason as to why i like it more than One Piece is that people die in HxH. 
Similar adventure style with lots of action, and mainly features around the protagonist (Gon in HXH and Luffy and his crew in One Piece). Like how Gon's goal was to become a Hunter etc, Luffy's goal is to become the pirate king, so they both have that similar sort of drive as characters. 
Both anime are shounen with super powers, fight scenes, friends and adventure.Both have funny and sad scenes.Both have a carefree and a little bit stupid protagonists.Both have badass characters and epic moments. 
Both really great animes that I love, if you like One Piece, you should definitely watch Hunter X Hunter. If you like Shounen, this is the way to go. Luffy and Gon have adventures and fun while still striving towards their goal- Pirate King and the best Hunter. Although they may seem to be fooling around, when push comes to shove they are great friends you'd definitely want watching your back. Both anime have great side characters and plots. I would totally watch Hunter X Hunter! 
-The most creative worlds in anime-Lovable characters with somewhat unattractive designs (at least different from normal)-Soundtrack gives the shows a similar feel 
Diverse world with changing settings, excellent fight scenes, and a diverse and interesting cast of characters. 
These 2 are one of the most popular long running shounen and are both really fun shows. filled with likable characters, interesting plot, and are adventurous. also my top long running shounens! 
Lighthearted anime with exciting fighting arc's (beware of filler episodes - HxH has less fillers).Innocent and ambigious main character with badass friends, interesting side characters and a lot of plot twists.In search for something very important to them. Friendship is the key.(Adventure, Action, Fantasy, Superpower, Shounen). 
HunterxHunter is very similar in terms of what you like. I love both of these series even if they are shounen. They both can be really dark in certain moments, but overall these two are really good 
Both main characters are young with high potential ! 
both of these anime have  amazing action and adventure experience and shows an unbreakable bond of friendship 
Hunter x Hunter is an amazing shonen anime about a boy named Gon who leaves his home to take on one of the toughest jobs in the world, being a hunter. No, he's not hunting deer or rabbits, he's looking for his dad, whom he hasn't seen since he was a baby. On the way, he meets Leorio, Kurapika, and Killua, who help him on his journey.I've loved this show ever since I discovered it in 2014. It's got great animation, compelling characters, and great story arcs. If you like the first Hunter Exam arc, you'll probably like the rest. 
While this is super long running, it has the same adventure vibes as HxH. Although instead of hunters, the focus is on pirates. overall, if you're into long running adventures and love to binge watch, you'll be able to get caught up with One Piece in a cinch 
Both are great shounen series.great stories.longer arcsawesome powers.great character development 
Started at kind, lovely atmosphere then it turns into more serious atmosphere. The characters want adventure and stronger as many stronger enemies will appear. 
Both are battle manga with have a focus on friendship, and the two Mcs would do anything to help their friends. 
Both are great anime that have: - Huge and great world building.- Group of friends that are going on an entertaining adventure and etcIf you like one of them you will like the other. 
Both shounen action series with intricate world building and delve into various character studies. 
Adventurous and with great story telling. Smart action and side characters have their times in the spotlight. 
-you'll love the series instantly-the main characters are great-the storyline is very interesting-amazing fights 
One piece is like the light hearted version of hunter x hunter and is highly similar to the series in terms of plot. If you enjoyed one piece and are looking for a heavier adventure hxh is for you. While if you liked hxh and are looking for a more carefree adventure the one piece is for you. 
Both are top notch shounen anime. Usually we can see that whatever the genre of an anime is there is a bit romance in the story line. But Hunter X Hunter and One piece are anime where there is no specifically romance and both of the mc are adventure lovers. They work and struggle towards their goals.Like Luffy is a boy who wants to be a pirate king and Gon is a boy who wants to be a great hunter to know why his dad abandoned him for being a hunter. That's all. Both of the anime is quite good.  
Both are adventurous and travel the world.  
- Large, open world: plenty of worldbuilding in each story- Adventure-based plot line- Wide Character Cast- Fighting isn't always just brawling: it's also about being shrewd, intelligent, calculating and deceptive- Dangerous and unique supernatural abilities- The protagonist seems naive, but has an air of mystery about them that foreshadows something about their true side 
""Hunter x Hunter"" is one of the relics of the manga and anime world, which places us under the watchful eye of Gon Freecss. This young protagonist has a goal that, like Luffy, will make him embark on a long journey. As one of the anime similar to ""One Piece"", then, we will see Gon overcoming all kinds of adversities in order to become a 'hunter', a title that receives a select group of individuals to which his father belongs, who abandoned him from Too small to become the standout of all hunters. So, those who have enjoyed moments like Luffy realizing that they were no match for Kuma, or stories like that of Sanji and the Vinsmokes, will find in ""Hunter x Hunter"" a narrative that is also the best in the whole panorama of the shounen. read more 
Similar deep themes and both have incredible antagonists. in my opinion, OP is one of only two shonen that comes close to being as good as hxh.(the other being FMAB) 
-great storylines and arcs - great battle systems- loveable characters   
They both have a good and enjoyable storyline and if you like Hunter then you will also enjoy One Piece 
Both main characters have a similar journey, and the story can be overall similar. 
The emotions in both anime hit close to the heart in a way I have yet to see in other battle shonen to the degree of talent that they are down in either of these two animes.The depth of worldbuilding in One Piece is a step above the greatness that exists in Hunter x Hunter, so there's a bonus in that regard.If you enjoyed the sense of family that exists in HxH between characters like Gon, Killua, Kurapika, and all the other loveable characters, you get that same attachment with fellow Straw Hat recruits and even what appears as minor side characters at first still manage to get you caring about them.The action in HxH is great and honestly hard to beat, but that's not to say One Piece doesn't have its fair share of action, while not on par with HxH, they are still a treat to watch and have gotten better as the anime progressed. read more 
Both contents are based on the aim of the main characters. One of them wants to see his father and other one wants to be Pirate King and both characters have strong determination to reach their aim. I'm sure that all spectators will admire their both determination. Also main characters are good-hearted, cheerful and childish for each animes. Moreover, side characters also well thought and varied for both of them. Some pieces of their lives of the side characters are being shared in both animes, with this way you might connect to the frames of mind of the almost all characters with pleasure.The only bad thing of Hunter X Hunter which is release date. New episodes are being added slow. read more 
It's also shonen, although this is longer and has way too much episodes. This will keep you up at night. The fights are really good, and if you like shonen genre then this might be the one for you too just like hunter x hunter.  
One Piece has always been great when it comes to a good challenge—especially a good fight! Another show that certainly has this element is Hunter x Hunter. To be a hunter is a huge privilege and you need to take the Hunter Exam in order to pass. The only catch? There's an extremely low success rate and it's pretty dangerous. Gon Freecss is out to become a Hunter so he can find his missing father. "
11061,34599,25,"Both of them are amazing adventure series with endlessly imaginative settings.Both of them have young and naive main characters that undergo a lot of development and go through a lot of hardships on their adventure, learning things the hard way.Both of them explore the idea of downwards vertical exploration, in Made in Abyss's case, it is the main driving force behind the story and with Hunter x Hunter it is part of one of the challenges from the first part of the series.Both of them have complex themes and dark aspects to them.Both of them aren't afraid to show how cruel the world can be.Both of them can be very psychological at points.Both of them have a main character that can smile no matter what hardship they are faced with and can remain optimistic no matter what. read more 
Adventure! The search for the unknown! Made in Abyss is quite similar to Hunter x Hunter given the fact that in both the animes, the main character goes out for adventure with his/her friends. The main character of Made in Abyss, Riko, goes into the abyss in search for her mother, whearas Gon. the main lead of HxH, adventures the vast Hunter world in search for his father. 
Both anime start with the motivation of the protagonist wanting to find his/her parent, who are considered legendary at what they do.These series start in a somewhat light tone but get progressively darker as time passes.Their settings allow for very interesting worldbuilding that makes the viewer want to know more about the world of the characters, giving a fantastic adventure feeling. 
Both have a great narrator.Both are very creative when it comes to creatures and scenery. (Made in Abyss a little more)Both have a duo with interesting chemistry.Both have great story.Both have good fights (Hunter fights are better so far though) 
-Both of them tell us about a child who wants to meet his/her parents. -The main character has an extraordinary curiosity about his/her world. -The main character has a very loyal friend who accompanies his/her adventure. -The job, either Hunter or Cave Raiders, have the same essence-Set in a world of unknown truth. -Has many mysteries that spur our curiosity.-Although both are played by a child, but the story is very worth. 
- Each MC core aspiration is a parent figure that they have never seen before but heard a lot of great things about and use that to improve themselves and conquer all obstacles to one day meet that parent figure- The main characters parent is considered a legend - Both setting are based in a fantasy world where society is run by one thing (like hunters and cave raiders) - Each have dark physiological elements and vibes occasionally throughout both anime- Both M.C are always going aganist what people tell them and doing things that they want to do out of shear curiosity with a overly optimistic outlook on the situations which sometimes makes them seem naive but are not afraid to face the harsh reality of there worlds- Both have a mystery element in each, for example; the vast unknown of the depth below there village and other hunters motive/true nature keeps you guessing-Also each have a ""villian"" that is very creepy in there own certain ways like orzen and hisoka- Both have a taboo scene(s) like hisoka can be seen as a child predator because of his obession with gon and in made in abyss the children are strung up naked when beaten  read more 
ok... the first time i look from made in abyss that similar to HXH is :1. they both anime have 2 person that close.. to each other and to protect  each other... 2. both have parent are having adventure to somewhere and wanted their children to catch them.. their parent well... are quite similar...3. the character in made in abyss like hunter x hunter... they are like rough diamond that need to be polish... and have unique ability that complete each other.. 
Two adventure anime following the paths of two kids as they explore an uncharted world in search for their mysterious parents. The universes are very different but in a way, the main characters and their circumstances are somewhat similar.Gon and Riko share this incredible positivity, determination, and the will to face adversity in order to find the truth about their parents, while Killua and Regu protect them like caring big brothers, build unbreakable bonds of friendship along the way, and overcome their limitations working as a team.The main difference consists in Hunter x Hunter (2011) being a more action and strategic fights oriented anime with a lot of physical development, while Made in Abyss focuses on world-building and the beauty and mystery of its dangerous yet beautiful unexplored world.In general, both manage to balance the cuteness of the characters and beauty of their backgrounds with a cruel and harsh reality that keeps punishing their main characters and presenting physical and psychological obstacles to be overcome in order to unveil the mysteries. read more 
Both have many things in common. A light-hearted adventure protagonized by 12-year-olds (even two characters, Reg and Killua, share voice actress), with dark tones and a bit of gore. The main characters explore different places and become, respectively, Cave Raiders and Hunters in order to meet with a familiar (Riko’s mother and Gon’s father). They’re also accompanied by other characters who have different objectives. Oh, and the antagonists are so likable, too. If you liked one of them, the other one is highly recommended 
The two protagonists of both series (Gon - HxH / Riko - Mia) are looking for their parents with the help of their friends (Killua - HxH / Reg - Mia). Childish at first, but suddenly it starts to get dark. 
A child looking for his parent in a world that looks innocent, but it can be very atmospheric and cruel. Both have an excellent adventure vibe. 
Started as a happy go themed then it turns into a dark story. The blood is also present. The story has some interesting elements. Pretty a good watch. 
>Gon is searching for his father, Riko is searching for his mother, the plot centers around it. Also, Lyza (Riko's mother) and Ging (Gon's Father) have very similar personalities.>At first, both looks childish, but suddenly becomes dark, cruel and ""creepy"".>Perfect pacing and worldbuilding. In both anime, the ""universe"" is a complete mystery to be discovered.>Good characterization for both protagonists, they become more ""human"" as the series progresses.>The way that the ""system"" of Hunters and Cavers works it's a little similar.The only significant difference, is that HxH has a thematic more focused on shounen elements, ""super powers"", ""frenetic/intelligente battles"" and  ""a plot that is separated by arcs""... Made in Abyss, on the other hand, does not have much of it. read more 
- Both have a great feel for adventure- Both have MCs who are generally positive and carefree- MCs of both anime have a parent who they look up to and try to find- Both are not afraid to go into very dark and disturbing territory- Both have an iconic duo who share their hardships 
Deceptively innocent in the beginningFollows 12 y/o protagonistsExcellent Fantasy/adventure seriesGood world-building 
Very similar setting and plot development. At first, both looks an average cliche anime, but suddenly becomes dense and dark with some ""psychological"" elements. A journey into the unknown is not only nakamas and happiness, you will find cruelty and adversities too. Both protagonist have the exact same motivation to  get on a journey. 
hunter x hunter and made in abyss are the only animes that have given me this certain feeling of adventre and the wonder what will happen next. I keep wanting to find more info about both worlds. Made in abyss has amazing visuals and some good  atmosphere. The charrecters seem alive and are all intresting in the same way as hunter x hunter. but yeah my mindless ranting about how good the anime is does not give it justice go watch it. hunter x hunter is one of my all time faivourites and i don't use that word lightly. made  in abyss is my best of 2017 if nothing better comes out and it might even be all time faivourite material for me. and i know im selling it a bit high now but go in with an open mind and  don't expect anything  read more 
Looks childish, but it takes you by surprise... Both MC are childs trying to find their parents; Gon and Killua (HxH) relationship are very similar to Riko and Reg (MiA), the ""Hunters"" and the ""Cavers"" use some similar concepts. Both HxH and MiAbyss are adventure anime that presents an interesting worldbuilding, interesting characters combined with a realistic setting; no ""friendship power"", there's no protagonist trying to be the best, no super villains trying to destroy the world etc. 
-Both MC are trying to find their parents who are very important characters in the world the story is set to.-Both are really great adventure.-Both have 2 child MC.-Both get darker as the story goes on. 
both anime are starting in a light hearted way but then develop an amazing dark plot and the story progresses from a light hearted kids anime to a dark shonen anime. 
Both series follow two young children on their quest into the wider world and becoming a part of their desired profession, for Gon and Killua it's becoming a hunter, learning Nen and finding Gon's father, and for Riko and Reg it's descending into the abyss, finding Rikos mother and learning the origins of Reg.Both series also have a very similar visual and auditorial presentation, with upbeat and forest/tribal inspired music, as well as a lot of natural landscapes and bizarre and imaginative animals.Finally, the two main characters are also fairly similar too, Riko could be likened to the upbeat and optimistic Gon, both of which are searching for their elusive parents, and Reg could be likened to Killua, the calm, levelheaded, combat proficient and occasionally tsundere partner.Of course they also have plenty of differences but if you enjoyed these aspects of HxH then i think you will like Made in Abyss. read more 
The two animes begin by showing a universe full of mysteries and places never explored, with dangerous creatures totally unknown. 
The sense of adventure and wonder and sense of the unkown is shared with HXH 
made in abyss reminds me of hunter x hunter. main character goes on an adventure with the side characters. 
Both the anime are adventure-fantasy type...In HxH, Gon goes on an adventure in search of his father and also wants to fulfill his dreams of becoming a hunter.Similarly, In Made In Abyss, Riko searches her mother and wants to go to the depths of the abyss.....  "
11061,38000,11,"I'm guessing people have made this comparison before but Muzan really reminds me of Meruem for some reason, mostly aesthetically but also Muruem when freshly hatched even seems similar personality wise.The dedication and intense training it takes to become both a Hunter and a Demon Slayer is similar.Although in HxH they're not demons they also face a lot of inhuman enemies. 
The hunter x hunter chimera ant arc from the 2011 show has alot of similarities to this show.here are some of them:- Both deal with insectlike opponents and enemies at some point.- Both shows have great battles that are well made and exciting and have somewhat the same feel to them.- Both battleshounen- Both gradually get more dark 
Two exciting and violent battle shounen anime about a group of young protagonists that have to face many brutal challenges, they have to constantly fight and deal with much much stronger opponents. Both shows have excellent production values with exciting fight scenes. 
Both got great fighting animation, got strong main character, amazing stories, and the adventure. The best from these both is the adventure and the action scenes. 
-Similar protagonist vibes and action due to them being both action shoujens-Main antagonists from both animes remind you heavily of eachother-Protagonists fighting powerful terroristic group with powerful enemies with unique abilities 
In terms of quality, both remarkable shounens stand at almost equal footing, both higher than what other shounens have done. From I can name on the top of my head...-Both protagonists are hard-headed individuals, guys who don't think before they speak but instead let their emotions do the talking for them.-Both animes have overall beautiful and riveting soundtracks, which are immensely crucial to making their scenes as impactful as it is. While they hold different styles, it would be difficult to prefer one over the other. The quality of the music are on par.-When you take all the seriousness out of the stories, both have a special kind of lightheartedness attached to the anime read more 
similarities:1- The MCs are optimists + after some training, they become VERY strong2- Good Action 3- Adventure Gore Action Group of friends4- Both MCs are on an adventure with a partner and are looking for something5- Both MCs have huge potential and are extremely strong 
Both are shounen with a good animated fights and a strong MC who has a good fighting sense  
Although this show is fairly new, even the Hunter x Hunter mangaka (Togashi) recommended reading the Kimetsu no Yaiba manga series. The anime adaptation has been great so far and as a huge fan of HxH, I've enjoyed it.  
The MCs in both of these anime have the same personality, They are very nice and lovable just like their friends. The fighting scenes are really awesome and the adventures of the characters are really cool. Both anime have such good characters, it's hard to find alot of characters that you'll hate! 
The main character is incredibly similar to GonAwesome action scenesBig family aspectAwesome side characters "
11061,30276,10,"One punch man has HERO ASSOCIATION, while hunter x hunter has HUNTER ASSOCIATIONBoth of them tells about character's unique power. 
Both animes are from the same studio. Meaning they look awesome, just AWESOME.The fights are easy to follow, look amazing and have a lot of detail.Some characters looks really remind you of another in a positive way.Both animes have a goal to aspire. Becoming a great Hunter or a great Hero.They involve different species and a complex varied world. 
Many of the characters from One Punch Man and the setting reminded me of Hunter x Hunter. If One Punch Man weren't a parody, had a lot more episodes, and if Saitama weren't OP, you would almost have a Hunter x Hunter twin-series. 
Both anime are done by Madhouse and have the same overall feel to the series - unique characters, epic battles and power-ups, etc. The ""Hero"" system in OPM and the ""Hunter"" system in HxH are very similar as well. Both are incredibly good shounen series, and while OPM is more humorous, there's a high chance you'll enjoy one if you enjoyed the other.  
Both have some of the same themes like an association of professionals (heroes/treasure hunters) with class ranks and an elite set of very strong people and the main character eventually decides to work his way up the ranks and become more well known and stronger in the process 
Both shows have an organization that the main protagonist joins to fulfill some sort of goal. The Hero Association and the Hunter Association in the two shows remind me of the other. Both have a ranking system which dictates what level of jobs you are likely to be allowed to complete. They involve a rigorous test which has a small passing rate. Also both organizations send out their heroes/hunters to battle and take care of weird creatures that could pose a threat to humanity.  Another comparison is that that main characters have a similar altruistic attitude towards helping people. All in all, these are both great shows that I would highly recommend, so if you liked one, you'll enjoy the other.  read more 
Both have equally crazy fights and whacky characters. OPM opening also parodies HxH's main character, Gon (the punch where he holds his left hand over his right before punching).Both have probably the most brilliant soundtracks ever also. You really need to experience these two. And of course, both are by Madhouse Studio. 
Both are fun and interesting takes on less conventional superheroes, though in Hunter x Hunter they're called Hunters rather than superheroes. Both have a diverse and spectacular cast of minor characters. Hunter x Hunter is more emotional, but both have great comedy and are a joy to watch. Both have a lovable main character and a lovable side-kick. 
Most of the characters share a few traits: they seem like normal human beings, but they bear very special talents that might not be recognized in the real world. If you love laughs, drama and the struggles of being “different"", then you will love this as well. 
Tournaments, different powerstyles and various heroes "
11061,16498,8,"These two anime are depressing to watch. SnK is fully depressing but HxH is like cheerful at first then becoming a psychological kind of anime at the last part. Either way, these two have bad-ass female characters. 
Shingeki no Kyojin is focusing on titans eating humans and they do this for no known reason. And even though most of hunter x hunter dosen't have people getting eaten I still think the current arc (Chimera Ant Arc) in Hunter x Hunter is similar because of how dark it is. People are getting eaten and killed, It has the same feeling of hopelessness especially later in the arc and it's just way darker than most shounens.. They are not afraid to go more mature and use more matures themes 
It's similar because it's much darker than all the popular ongoing shounens.. Even though hunter x hunter seems abit lighthearted at first don't be fooled because it's one series that is not afraid to kill of people.. And the current arc of hunter x hunter focuses on the so called Chimera Ants eating people which is very similar to shingeki no kyojin.. And it also has gives you the same feeling of hopelessness.. I've read both mangas and I know that the chimera ant arc gets really dark and makes you feel there is no hope just like shingeki no kyojin 
The Chimera ant arc of Hunter x Hunter 2011 is very similar to Shingeki no Kyojin: in Snk people are eaten by Titans,in Hunter x Hunter by Chimera Ant. Also,they're both different,darker and more mature shonens,completely different from clichè shonens like Naruto,Ao no exorcist ecc. I wonder why HxH is still rated PG-13. 
This is a shonen with dark theme, gore, monster eating human in the chimera ant arc. This isn't a cliche anime, there is the same feeling of hopelessness in the chimera ant arc and in the Phantom Troupe arc. 
Shingeki no Kyojin is a very violent anime that isn't afraid to kill off characters, and that is one of the reasons so many people love the anime. This cruelty can be seen right when you look at the promotional art from the series. Hunter x Hunter is very similar to Kyojin in the fact that death is not held back, but unlike Kyojin you cant tell that just by looking at it. Don't be fooled by the happy childish outside, HxH is brutal ride filled with death of characters you knew just long enough to fall in love with. If you like anime with a great story, characters , action, and music that doesn't hold back death, then you will LOVE HxH. read more 
The two have similar action, in the side both are not all ""fight-hard"" but more psychological action. Interesting changing plot with all full of awesome characters (a lot of cast!!).The Chimera Ant arc in Hunter x Hunter is quite similar to the whole Shingeki series, having their respectively ""human-eating"" beings.(Also, the design of some characters are SO similar you could say are the same XD) 
First of all, these 2 anime are probably anime you've heard of because its one of the popular anime. The similarities in these 2 anime are that the MC is going on a quest and fighting for their family. The difference is that the Attack on Titan MC is fighting to save his city and to also protect his family. In Hunter x Hunter the MC seeks out on an adventure where he fights and meets other people to locate his Dad and find out why his Dad left him at such a young age to become a Hunter. Attack on Titan is the short one with 59 episodes. Hunter x Hunter is the long one with 148 episodes. Hope this helped. read more "
11061,40748,7,"Both feature unique power systems and amazing world building. Both series can have a dark gritty tone but perfectly balance it with it's more lighthearted bits. 
they are both shounen and more importanly their power systems are very complex and well though out and fun to see and the two main chracters have very similar personalities beside the hype and pump of Adrenaline you get from the fights and very well done and solidly written villains. definitely recommend jujutsu kaisen If you liked hunterXhunter 
Both have similar power/magic systems, that are structured in very similar ways.Both are dark battle fantasy anime.Both have strong horror elements.Both have memorable casts of memorable characters.  
The two of them have powerful and intelligent fights, and they present great story and characters, you must read the manga and watch the anime 
Has a unique power system. 
If you like the powers and abilities unique to each character similar to Hunter x Hunter or Psyren, coupled with the strong bonds of friendship that's not cliche as naruto and one piece but kind of like how Hitman Reborn was, then this is the anime and the manga for you. Jujutsu Kaisen is malleable enough to be Shonen but has the gore and realism elements in it to also be close to some Seinen anime/manga such as Berserk (well maybe not that fucked up but you know what I mean) or Ajin. Since I have bias towards anime with unique power structures like Hunter x Hunter and Psyren where its just not the generic shout=power up or friendship-danger=instapower, the anime and the manga really speak out to me and I hope you'll pick it up and support it so that the awesome sequences in the manga will continue to be animated.  read more 
First of all, both anime are great. Both anime uses the ""magic power"" system aspect in their shows. (you know what I mean if you watch one of them). Honestly both great shounen, go watch them now. "
11061,10087,4,"Shounen battle shows that spend more time talking about ambitions, rules, and mechanics than actually fighting, making the plot and action even better since the viewer fully understands the importance and consequences of every move the characters make. 
Similar dark setting with lots of strategic battles and an equaling amount of brutality-- perfect choices for those who are fans of grey and gray morality series. Also, there are a lot of likable and interesting characters in both series-- feel free choose your favorite. 
If you're a fan of fights with strategic thinking then these two are for you. Most characters in both these anime are smart and cautious. Both anime have very good quality production. 
Both series touch on quite interesting topics. They have deep characters with whom we can be attached or hate.The most important thing is that at the time of the script, you can see that Fate / Zero is a seinen and HxH is a shounen. The second is less deep and less adult. But it can be understood since they are aimed at different audiences.It is important to emphasize the fact that Fate is a complete saga and HxH is not. "
11061,32182,4,"no one make a recommendation to HxH? okay, the similariity between these 2 animes is in the way they tend to over-expaining something narratively though MPS's was more humorous and yet it's rare to see any anime that put narration dominant in a  episode. 
The characters and setting, while very different, feels similar in the lighthearted sense. 
I love hxh and while i watched Mob reminded me the meaning of friendship, and also the battles and the uniqueness on every esper, was nice :) (especial season 2) 
It has great Mcs and Really Great actions "
11061,31933,4,"I've longed for another show similar to HxH. Diamond is Unbreakable comes the closest in the aspects I think are the most important:-Characters all have unique and extremely creative abilities-Fights are almost always won by quick thinking, clever application of your ability, or outsmarting your opponent, rather than the much more cliche ""willpower/brute strength/plot convenience"". -Both are fairly unpredictable - you may even know the direction the show will go, but will have no clue how it'll get there-Very likable main cast and interesting main villains 
- Normal people receiving random powers and using them not for any big cause, but for their own sake- There's no clear line between good and evil- Very good character development- Bright colors, beautiful art, unforgettable music- Unforgettable antagonists with deep character development and fully understandable reasons to act- Good exploration of the theme ""friendship"", with an acceptable number of clichés and tropes- Relatable characters, very likable main squad- Fights based on the smart use of the fighters' quirks, not only their brawns- Both are shonen from experienced and mature authors, and are considered for many to be their magna opera 
Jojo has amazing power system just like nen from hxh , very creative and have originality. 
Both have heavy action, amazing animation and a fenomenal story with interesting characters.Only difference is that HxH is longer but has a better way of connecting you to the characters. "

As you can notice how important the friendship and teammate elements are very important during the series. Hunter X Hunter is a must watch if you like Magi! I'm a big fan of both shows and I can tell how much they are familiar! The fighting styles are fairly similar to Magi, including the settings of the story and pretty much the artstyles as you can trust MadHouse. Though Magic is not included ((cough Hisoka cough)) in the HxH series, they are both very popular Shounen series. Both shows does also focus on side character's stories as it makes the show more intense and relaxing to watch. read more 
Both of these anime feature a charismatic and friendly protagonist who is oblivious to the malice of the world. Both of these protagonists (Aladdin in Magi and Gon in HxH) are incredibly forgiving of the transgressions of their enemies and they see the horrible world that both of them reside in through very bright lenses. They can't (or maybe don't want to) see the darkness present within others. Both of these anime involve the main characters embarking on a journey or adventure of one sort or another and both contain plenty of high-octane fights with aesthetically pleasing visuals and cool power systems. Djinn Equips(Magi) make up for their lack of creative use and specialization with sheer flair and flamboyance.  Both anime contain themes of vengeance and whether or not vengeance is truly right. There are plenty of other things, however, saying more will ultimately spoil things for you. If you liked one, you'll probably like the other. read more "
11061,45,3,"i think those two anime are alike because they both have a deep meaningful plot. overall art, story , and the imagination-world are all necessary to define a well value anime. this recommendation isn't based on just a fanboy expressions but a well belief of knowing what is great. 
As Rurouni Kenshin, the duels in Hunter x Hunter are more based in Strategy and in the psychological state of the fighters than in special powers. Also, the majority of the cast in both anime are morally ambiguous characters. Lastly, both have great arcs, Yorkshin in Hunter x Hunter and Kyoto in Rurouni, that focus in a bunch of charismatic bandits that the viewer will surprisingly support and love. 
It's very enjoyable to watch Rurouni Kenshin if you have already watched Hunter X Hunter. There is a lot of similarities between these two top tier pieces of battle shounen genre, like the construction of the impact in the major scenes, the way with which the anime induces you to empathize with the characters, and the constant explanations of special powers. "
11061,1535,3,"-Both animes have a type of ""intellectual"" battle going on. They both feature battles of wits. Even though Hunter x Hunter focuses more on action and Death Note with more psychological aspects, they still closely coincide with each other. -Both protagonists are in pursuit of a goal. Light to become God and Gon to find his father 
Both have moments of thinking/monloguing, puzzle-solving, strategy, and cat-and-mouse games. 
These two anime are directed by Madhouse studios and are composed with Yoshihisa Hirano. Funny enough, I feel that these two share a bit in common in terms of psychological depth and anguish. The Yorknew arc feels especially similar to the plot of Death Note and both tend to have a bit of religion and prophecy involved. Some seiyuus also share roles in these two anime (i.e. Mamoru Miyano with Light Yagami and Chrollo Lucilfer). "
11061,33486,3,"- Both have the similar formula of starting out weak and growing strong with experience and training- Character development- The characters are young and is focused on more than one character- The fight scenes are strategic, they thoroughly explain how to counter one another- In a way, the characters are often underestimated- Each character has specialties, just like how they have quirks- Binge-worthy, you always want to know what happens next. 
Both are great action series with plenty of good animation and likeable characters. 
Both are unpredictable and had many casts,the 1st half of mha also very similar to first arc,hunter exam "
11061,20583,2,"Apart from the obviously different themes, these two Anime pretty much share the exact same key components that make them special and great:- Consistent character-power-levels; No random jumps in strength or cheap gimmicks (à la One Piece, Dragon Ball, Kuroko no Basket)- Great focus on training and becoming more powerful over time- Just the perfect amount of quirkiness for all characters; Every character feels unique and different, but is still believable and relatable (once again, see One Piece or Kuroko no Basket for bad examples of this)- None of the characters are unbeatable or without weaknesses- Tense fights/matches that are often won through wit- Actual losses do happen, making every confrontation that more excitingSo, if you liked either show, then the other is an absolute must-watch in my opinion.  read more 
Before you say ""I don't like Sports Anime"" just hear me out. While it may seem weird to recommend Hunter x Hunter to Haikyuu, I have good reason.

Both shows have protagonists that at the beginning of the show seem invincible but still likeable (like their fathers before them); we see the go through adversity and overcoming them in relatively amazing ways.Both shows have an expansive cast that interacts in both expected and unexpected ways.

Note: I'm recommending Monogatari series as a whole and not only Bakemonogatari.Both series aren't one-sided stories and are divided into multiple arcs in the entire series due to a dissimilar reasons but has one reason in common, wide cast of important characters with some obstacles or goals as the series portrayed.Both series are monologue-heavy. This is not 100% guaranteed but both series had a very engaging 3 dimensional characters that you might get attached to, I personally got attached to them so.Both series are quite philosophical too, way close to realism. "

820,1575,21,"Imagine Code Geass without ""magical eyes"", mechs, ideas like ""the one who yells louder wins"", immortal women and stupid idealism (hi Suzaku). You with me so far? Now, imagine Code Geass where there are dozens of great commanders like Lelouch on both sides, where political intrigues, plots and schemes are far from uncommon. Imagine battles of epic proportions and war on the galactic scale, where winning side is decided only by commanders intelligence, number of troops, their morale and available resources, not superunits like Lancelot. Do this and you've invented LoGH. 
In Both the hero is nobility. Lelouch was a discarded prince while Reinhard was a poor noble. But both want to remove the nobility from power. Both have grand plans to unify the world for the sake of their sisters. Both are charismatic and have strong allies and enemies. Both are Genius military guys and will make sacrifices for the grand dream. 
Aristocratic governments, political machinations, Xanatos' gambits, the whole shebang. 
Hubris. Revenge. Noblesse Oblige. Revolution. Heroics. Anti-Heroics. Tragedy. Power grabs. Machiavellian schemes. Funny European names. If you like those, then you'll like both shows.In addition, both stories follow a young man who wants revenge by increasing his power until he can succeed in overthrowing the monarchy because of the Emperor being a jackass who ruined the life of the protagonist's sister. 
Code Geass is essentially a ""down to earth"" (literally) version of Legend of the Galactic Heroes, and I don't mean that in a condescending way.Since the basic plot and characters are similar, I thought I'd outline some of the main differences between the two shows. Oh, and I'm also writing this under the assumption that people like these shows primarily because of the strategy behind the battles. Some minor spoilers may be included. You have been warned.Legend of Galactic Heroes1. There are Lelouches on both sides (i.e. people other than Lelouch are not portrayed as whimpering idiots).2. There is none of that ""I have the Nightmare with more guns than you so I win"" crap. Actual strategy and tactics are demonstrated throughout the whole show - formation, movement, timing, geography etc.3. Suzaku, the ridiculous idealist who must say and do what he thinks is right, doesn't exist (replaced by a slightly less vocal Kircheis).4. At one point, LoGH becomes difficult to follow which its detailed storyline, huge cast of characters and the lengthy timeline over which the show spans.5. There are no supernatural powers that allow you to control people. Both commanders don't start from zero in the first place, so they have no need for Geass. Lelouch didn't need Geass as much once he established himself either.Code Geass1. Lelouch actually loses...many times. Maybe it's just me, but I swear the main commanders in LoGH don't ever ""lose""; Reinhard wins by decimating the Alliance's forces, but Yang also wins because he pulled off a miraculous retreat - everybody wins! Yeah...no.2. CG definitely has better graphics. Something from 1988 just can't compare...3. Reinhard, the super-genius robot, doesn't exist (replaced by a slightly more human Lelouch).4. I feel CG, even without Geass, is less realistic in general; by less realistic, I mean there are ""unbelievable coincidences"" happening all over the place.5. There are more obvious plot holes. For example, the fact that Lelouch never commands anyone to obey all his commands (until the end of R2)...is a major one.Watch whichever. Hell, watch both. Even if I don't sound very supportive, I really think they're both amazing. read more 
But focus heavily on tactics and strategy. 
Empire, politics, rebellions, good characters and all that jazz 
what happens when there are bunch of brilliant masterminds like lelouch on both sides vying for world supremacy that is LOGH. Code Geass is pure mecha while LOGH is spacewar. 
Both have battles that don't rely on strength in numbers or the capability of weapons to fight. They rely on strategies and tactics.Lelouch/Zero can compare to Reinhard because they are both tactical geniuses, as is Yang, Wenli from LOGH.Both anime give a clear explanation on how their world is run and the background of it. 
LOGH is the Mature and Sophisticated version of CG. It's the evolution from a kid still Potty Training, to being the Engineer that built the Zero-Gravity Space Toilet. It's the leap from being a Pee Wee League Basketball kid, to being the next Michael Jordan. It's the upgrade from Atari 2600 to the Playstation 4 or Xbox One. It's the difference in illumination between a Candle and the Sun. It's the transition from an Appetizer to the Main Course- and that is the main merit of watching CG, as to prepare you for the Real Deal.When one has seen enough of the ""Staples"" and ""Popular"" Anime, and are looking for the Next Level, they turn to the True Elite Logh. Until that point they can not be considered a True Anime Fan. read more 
Code Geass take heavy inspiration from LOGH, and some may come to say Geass is the ""teenage shounen"" version of LOGH.I prefer LOGH, because it's much more fleshed out compared to Geass. I would recommend LOGH to most people I know, while I would only recommend Geass to someone who can get by it's ""edgy teenage drama"" feel.  
Code Geass, but without the superpowers and a plot that actually makes sense. The shows have a lot of similar character types, however LoGH is much more grounded and build them to a much better degree.The show is heavy on politics and strateg, with schemes on both sides running deep. LoGH also presents many more sides than simply the good kids vs the oppressors. Each plotline raises many moral questions, and it's rare for anyone to ever be strictly in the right or wrong. 
I'll be harsh - Legend of Galactic Heroes is anime for grown ups instead lukewarm and childish thing that is Code Geass. I can not believe that CG is up on the leaderboards with LoGH. If You watched LoGH You will know what I mean. LoGH is all the things that is Code Geass + better politics, believable military strategies and better characterization. Only thing that LoGH lacks and may put you of is animation, its obsolete but You will get used to it and grow to love it by the end of the series :) 
Political plots, desire of power and revenge, clash of 2 ideals, brilliant military commanders, epic battles,  the shape of the 2 animes looks quite similar.The main difference is that Code Geass reaches the peak of ""popcorn"" animes (it is not a reproach) whilst LoGH has way more depth, it is a rewriting of History in the space opera genre. 
Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu is Code Geass father. It creates the genre, it creates the ""choral"" storytelling type in animation (story with lot of balanced characters facing each other, beyond the manichean traditionnal vision) and Lelouch's archetype with Reinhard von Lohengramm. Both animes tell ascent of a charismatic / machiavelic character who is a strategic genius. Both are about politic manipulation, war, peace (this is more developped in LOGH), love, friendship and trahison. But above all, they use same dramatic mecanic and are typically huge greek tragedy with tearing plot-twist which make you hate a  character, prefer another, questionning you about morality ... especially in LOGH you just can't take a side because both groups (Imperials and Rebels) are very well treated. If you watch Code Geass and you enjoy it , please try LOGH because you will not be deceived (don't look at old animation, look at the soul of the piece !), I promise you :) read more 
One can see how Legend of the Galactic Heroes influenced Code Geass. Despite both being set in the future, they both use medieval political systems and decor, the battles in both are very strategic (more so in LotGH) and they both feature an ambitious protagonist whose goals are for the sake of his sister.  
+ Revolve primarily around Political Theories.+ Military/ Sci-Fi orientated.+ Extremely intelligent MC's. 
There is an empire that rules with power, but suppresses human right's of citizens.Both protagonists want to overthrow the ruling empire for different reasons.They have a sister they want to protect and whom they are fighting for at the beginning. They don't want to lose her.They have a close friend who has a similar view of the empire and wants to change it.Both anime use themes of war and politics.The main focus is about the strategic masterminds that the protagonists are and everything counts for on one move. This epic and dangerous adventure is backed up by great pieces of music.Ginga Eiyuu Densets is set in space and tho many also view it as the Star Wars of anime.And it truly is and might also be better, although there are no lightsabers, sorry to disappoint you.BUT, Code Geass has a shit ton of cool Mechas that battle each other on earth. read more 
they seem very much in the military part and with genius protagonists who use great war strategies to defeat their opponents, so are the battles in Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu and Code geass.We can also mention that the two have ideologies on each side that result in a great rivalry, something that also reminds me of the Death Note 
In terms of tactics and conquest themed story lines, as well as a battle of intelligence. 
Both of them contain great Politics and great battle strategies. Both of these series have Ambitious Main Characters who care deeply about their sister. Both Series are great in their own ways. "
820,1535,9,"There are definitely parallels between the main four geniuses that become engaged in mind-game warfare in Death Note and Legend of the Galactic Heroes; to such an extent that it's very possible for LotGH to have been an inspirational factor for DN's author. On one side you have pampered pretty boys (Light and Reinhard) that ALWAYS seem to hold all the cards and have events play out in their favour. Their handsome appearances and manipulative abilities are used to their advantage. On the other, you have pure geniuses (L and Yang) that have to contend with never having the advantage due to their circumstances and never being able to fight on an even playing field. One is eccentric, while the other is lazy and has no desire for warfare of any kind--both failing to appeal in terms of social skills (mainly L, although Yang is also clumsy in this regard) / politically.There are differences, however. DN has Light and L get to know each other up close and personal as their mental battle plays out. LotGH, on the other hand, only has its leads meet ONCE in its 110 episode entirety: Reinhard and Yang battling it out at a distance by commanding space fleets against each other and making assumptions based on what little they know about each other. The mind-games having a third factor - circumstance - that pushes the plots in the required directions is too obvious to ignore. Also: successors continuing the battle. read more 
The setting is very different, but the way the show works out is similar. Instead of an intellectual battle between a detective and a god child, Legend of the Galactic Heroes has an intellectual battle between two fleet commanders, each fighting for their own version of justice. It's up to the viewer to decide who's really correct, in the end. 
Both feature genius' who fight primarily with their minds and the use of psychological warfare. Both shows tend to focus on the lead opponents and, therefore, treat other characters like supporting ones.The opponents also stand for different morals/beliefs and winning or losing means EVERYTHING.Death Note tends to cheapen human worth exchange for very addicting storytelling.Galactic Heroes takes a more natural approach to it's story, emphasizing on outcomes, what each side fights for; and HOW they can fight for it.It takes it's time developing situations, doesn't use otherworldly elements as an additive, and contains a very human soul. 
Both animes are very similar to each other. In both animes you óbserve two opposing factions who are trying to outwit the other. The basic idea is the same, whereas the rules and conditions might be a tad different. If you liked one of these, i honestly can not see a reason for you to not like the other. 
both anime have two geniuses fighting against each other for their principles  
Both deal with a battle of wits, although LOGH is on a much bigger scale. 
LoGH is the grandfather of genius vs. genius, battle of the wits genre of anime. 
Two highly intelligent protagonists with different views on how the world should be fight each other. Not physically, but with their intellect, through strategy and mind games. In Death Note it's more clear who the bad guy is while in Legend of the Galactic heroes both sides have legitimate arguments and it's more up to the reader to choose which one to support. Then again, some readers choose to support the evil side in Death Note anyway. 
These anime both feature genius protagonists who try to outwit each other. There is also no set antagonist so the viewer can decide whose ideals are correct.  "
820,338,9,"Though the content is significantly different (a space opera as opposed to a story on the French Revolution), the presentation and themes are very much similar. Political corruption—especially within the aristocracy—is a major theme in both titles. Both sides of the conflict are never portrayed as being intrinsically good or bad: there are only circumstances. Some parallels also exist within the characters; for example the relationship between Oscar and Andre resembling that of Reinhard and Kircheis. 
Legend Of Galactic Heroes may not be a shoujo like Rose Of Versailles so the romantic aspect is missing, but pretty much everything else about the series are similar, I may risk and say that LOGH went to take some aspects and influences of Rose, mainly the political and social critic of the aristocracy. The dramatic aspect and overall feeling throughout the series are pretty similar too not to speak that even the narrator has the same feel. 
Completely different plotwise but similar in nature. LoGH is a fictional space opera while Rose of Versailles is about the French Revolution. Yet both have a political background and deal with corruption and the consequences thereof in their own setting. There's a great cast of both main and side characters who develop from fairly unknown to people with massive influence. Moreover, the relationship between Reinhard and Kircheis is similar to that of Oscar and André. 
there isn't much that comapred to logh in terms of plot, but Rose of Versailles holds up if you enjoy classical series that involve politics, corruption, and ambiguous themes of good/bad. even if it's kinda shoujo 
Aristocracy-centric political dramas that make use of headstrong characters, an extensive setting, and smart presentation, carrying a very old-fashioned flair throughout.  
The two anime definitely have the same vibe and possess common main themes like corruption, political systems clashing and the fight for democracy by some party of the story.Rose of Versailles OST also reminded me of LotGH and the animation also holds some similarities despite the different periods they were animated.The time periods the stories happens is very different but holds many similar social and moral problems.The main characters develop a lot through the two long anime and change their minds at some time, most characters are not one-dimensional and they learn with their mistakes.Both anime are almost like animated documentaries of war. If you like to see what happens behind the curtains of war instead of just witnessing the action, who's plotting, scheming and commanding the troops, look no further. read more 
2 spectacular series rife with political intrigue, conspiracies and war. One thing I find incredible between both series is how important even minor characters become later in the series. They're both incredibly unpredictable yet each event occurs as the result of logical consequences to characters' actions. Though I think Ginga is more impressive in this regard, due to it being entirely fictional, it is still rather impressive how Versailles manages to pull off this unpredictable plot despite us all knowing the fate of many of the major characters.e.g King Louis and Antoinette.The main difference between these series is Ginga feels more focused on its thesis regarding the role of governance in a sci fi setting, however, Versailles has more of a focus on romance. I would say both are equally great. I would say every anime fan should watch these series at some point. read more 
Both share many similar themes, especially between the political intrigue from Reinhard's perspective in the Galactic Empire in the first half of LotGH, and Rose of Versailles, including some subplots that are similar. Both also share an incredibly similar narration style where a third-person narrator narrates and foreshadows certain events in the plot. The main protagonist from both also look similar, particularly between Reinhard von Lohengramm, and Oscar François.  
VnB and LotGH both take place in the aristocratic worlds of a feudal, military empire. The first 25 episodes of LotGH and VnB's plot and vibe are very similar, both depicting the downfall of corrupt feudal regimes disrespecting ordinary citizen. Both glorify 19th century values such as chivalry, honor, while limiting those to an aristocratic elite. Both are historical, with LotGH emphasizing this more (despite being fake history unlike VnB). VnB is far more emotional due to intended target audience (shoujo) and prominently has romance. "
820,19,9,"Both these shows are slow maticulous epics who focus on a large cast of characters from all angles without having to resort to predicably stale plot twists to grab the viewers attention. These are definitely more adult shows intellectually. The themes involved are drastically different but very much compatible, if you like Legend of the Galactic Heroes for its pace and storytelling rather than it's sci-fi you should be able to enjoy Monster's steady psychological development. Kenzou Tenma and Johan Liebert leave just as much impact as Yang Wenli and Reinhard von Lohengramm. 
While the themes are different, both are phenomenal at their ways of storytelling and are among the most intellectual shows i have ever seen. Both series also include a large cast of well developed characters. Both are Seinens. 
Both are clever, both have much about human psychology and heavy ethic questions 
Both are masterpieces with incredibly well written dialogue, realistic characters and really good stories.Both are rather slow paced.They are also both for a mature audience and have a similar feeling to them. 
Both series have great character development, drama, mystery. 
If you like epic story with great characters, you should watch these shows. They're different in setting, but definitely share a lot of similar plot elements and character study. 
Both have very interesting and unique concept. Both have heavy (but interesting) dialogue that your average viewer can't take. Lastly, both are MASTERPIECES. They have flaws but that doesnt stop them to be masterpieces. I just wish that Monster would enter the Top 10, or Top 20 would do. 
They have mature atmosphere, with longer complexer story, containing drama and crime elements. They resemble more to an American series than to animes. 
Both anime tells the story through multiple perspectives to drive the plot. Both require decent levels of iq to appreciate for what they are. Both have very dark themes and make you question your morality. On most of the anime lists I have seen, if you put Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu as a 10, you also put monster as a 10. Both these animes are absolute masterpieces and deserve to be watched.  "
820,12029,8,"Both are epic Space opera anime with a a strong cast of likeable heroes.  
Very similar as its also an extensive story with similar retro grafic styles 
Both shows are high caliber Anime space operas. I'm surprised no one has made this rec yet  
Both are the greatest space operas around. Though galactic heroes is a political thriller as well. 
Both are amazing space opera and I enjoy listening to the Yamato opening every time. 
The two series are space military science fiction animes.Both series show a very active war between the two empires, but while Legend focuses more on an ongoing war between two superpowers of comparable power, in Yamato one of them is on the verge of defeat and the anime covers an expedition to a far world that can win the war if they succeed.The strategy is equally important in both, but in Legend they can last several episodes or arcs and have effects some time later, while in Yamato it is generally limited to solving the typical situations of each episode.Both have that classic aesthetic of old spaceships, it contrasts a lot with the futurism that is the fashion now. Although this style has obviously been renewed in Yamato, it still retains the classic charm. It also applies to the design of the Yamato characters, they still have the original visual style but have been adapted to modern times very satisfactorily. Ironically, they are now one of my favorite modern anime designs.Both series have a strong policy component, but Legend has the same importance as military strategy. In Yamato it is simply limited to the fact that because the rival empire is a monarchy with high nobility, all those who lead the enemy combat forces against the Yamato have some importance in their empire. But that does not come to be exploited despite some good opportunities.Yamato undoubtedly has better action scenes and a certain point of suspense. Legend on the other hand, does not need that. read more

820,33,6,"Granted, there are huge differences in setting and presentation, but both center around one man's quest for ultimate power and the many sacrifices that come with this struggle. Political intrigue, war strategy and tactics, along with individual prowess on the battlefield dominate the storyline. 
Both are highly regarded timeless classics. Military warfare and political intrigue is profound here. 
- Reinhard and Griffith are quite similar in their goals and methods, even in appearance;- Both anime are stories of intrigues and politics;- Both are cruel and imply main characters' death;- There are many similar characters in both stories. The difference is in fact that Berserk is a fantasy story, Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu - science fiction. 
These are brilliant anime from the 1990s with a heavy focus on politics, war and drama. The character designs in both are a lot more realistic than the typical anime character designs. The characters of Griffith and Reinhard are also pretty damn similar in terms of their goals and personalities. 
- Both are classic anime- Both are about war and politics- Both are stories about dual protagonists- One of the protagonists in both series are genius tactician which are similar in terms of appearances, personalities and goals

820,10087,3,"Very similar anime. Amazing characters, great music and battles and epic dialogues. Also the anime isn't  good vs evil but rather the clash of ideologies.  
Both series revolve around war and have a lot of awesome action scenes. Both contain scenes of thought-provoking dialogue that revolves around characters' different attitudes toward a subject. The characters in both series are composed of a variety of entertaining personalities. To a lesser extent, the characters in both series aren't necessarily good or evil but instead somewhere in between. Legend of the Galactic Heroes does a much better job of portraying its characters neutrally while in Fate/Zero it seems that in general everyone was leaning toward the evil side of the spectrum; they're similar in that neither follow the story of a good protagonist fighting against an evil antagonist.  read more 
The characters of both series embody unique philosphies and ideals, being pit against eachother in an ideological battle royale filled with multilayered strategies and sudden betrayals.In Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu, several characters resemble real-life historical figures, while the cast of Fate literally includes reincarnated historical figures. "
820,10937,3,"Both Gundam Origin and LotGH deal with war and politics, and have a really similar vibe. Char and Reinhard are similar characters, as they are both tactical geniuses and have hidden agendas. Furthermore, the space battles in Gundam (episode 5) reminded me a lot of those in LotGH. 
Both Char and Reinhard are ambitious and Machiavellian characters. Both stories follow their development from precocious children to vengeful young adults and remarkable military tacticians.Of course, both stories take place in space, with large scale space battles. 
Both anime are military space operas with a large cast spanning a long time period, in which two factions of humanity fight over political differences and domination of the known universe. Both tonally resemble a dramatized history presentation, in which the political leaders, the military strategies, and the social impact of events are important story points. There are large scale battles in space and urban warfare in both, and backstories for the main characters from childhood to young adult. Both ""main main"" characters, Reinhard von Lohengramm and Casval Rem Deikun, are blonde Machiavellian prodigies and military strategists. There are many more parallels within the two large casts. The main difference is character maturity, Gundam has more shounen tropes with it's character designs. It also ist more action oriented, and has a smaller ""play ground"": in LotGH it's spanning several galaxies, in Gundam it's the solar system of Earth only. read more "
820,40028,3,"War, political intrigue, and morally ambiguous sides are defining features for LotGH and AoT's Final Season.  Both anime, especially LotGH, focus on every side of the conflict to give a complete picture of the war and blur which side is truly right or wrong. The two series also have a very similar fear of killing off characters (or rather, a lack thereof) with many important character deaths seen throughout both shows. Lastly, they share similarly large casts that continue to make contributions to the plot throughout.Be warned: although Legend of the Galactic Heroes' grand and complex story and character writing is just as good as Attack on Titan's (if not arguably better), the series is much slower paced, less visually interesting, and not an adrenaline rush of constant hype like AoT. read more 
Both are about a war where you get to see both sides and no one can be labelled a good guy or bad guyBoth have a lot of politics and a large cast that all get fleshed out and have importance to the large scale plot  
These anime follow both sides of their respective wars and show both the good and bad parts of them. Neither side is shown to be clearly superior to the other morally-speaking.For example, this similarity can be summed up perfectly in a quote from one of the main characters on the Alliance's side from Legend of the Galactic Heroes:""There are no such things as 'wars between absolute good and absolute evil' in human history. Instead, there exist wars between one subjective good and another subjective good, and conflicts between one righteous faith and another righteous faith. In the case of a unilateral war of aggression, the aggressor would believe in its own righteousness. That is why wars have never ceased. As long as humans believe in God and in righteousness, there is no way conflicts would ever disappear.""- Yang Wenli read more "

Not sure if this comparison is done often but it probably is, the main characters in both of these series both struggle with internal loneliness, obligation, and the feeling of being out of place or lacking a support system. They are also somewhat saved or changed by a kind group of females/female that helps encourage them and provide them with warmth they lacked before. I got a lot of your lie in April vibes watching Gatsu and if you like your lie in april in turn I think you'd be able to love Gatsu, and if you liked Gatsu you probably watched your lie but you'd probably like your lie in turn, the main characters are VERY similar and it tackles similar themes regarding prodigies, pressure, obligation etc. Both series are also animated wonderfully as well. read more "

They both also spend a lot of time with families who are not their own but treat them as such, the Kawamotos and the Furukawas.A lot of heart and emotion are put into both series. Even though After Story takes place over several years and Sangatsu only takes place over a few months, they're both equally effective in conveying emotions that anyone can relate to. I see people trying to argue that one is better than the other which makes no sense to me because both shows are excellent and if someone like one then I'm cetain they will love the other. read more 
3-gatsu no Lion is like Clannad: After Story but handled right in every aspect. 3-gatsu has richer character study, beautiful art (both character and background), and - most importantly - cute girls without eyeballs covering their faces.They're both emotional rollercoaster when it comes to enjoyment. While Clannad: AS uses spiritual elements to its plot, 3-gatsu in the other hand uses a realistic approach just like any slice of life shows out there. 
Both are masterpieces While clannad after story uses real-life situations and uses fantasy, march comes in like a lion uses real-life problems without fantasy.Both kind of give off the same vibe because both shows make us understand how the characters feel and the visuals are very beautiful.While I like clannad after story more, march comes in like a lion made me cry around the 4th episode while clannad made me cry more around the second half.  "

28851,32281,39,"Both Kimi no Na wa and Koe no Katachi are romantic films featuring young people who are on the cusp of adulthood. They are both emotionally moving with beautiful artwork and animation.Koe no Katachi doesn't have the same supernatural element that comes with Kimi no Na wa, but it has a similar impact. However, while Koe no Katachi is appropriate for adolescent viewers, it does deal with some severe bullying and darker themes that are absent in Kimi no Na wa, so if that is something that is difficult for you, you may want to avoid this film. 
I personally cannot help but be reminded of the other movie when thinking about one of them. Perhaps it has something to do with both films releasing within the same season and me watching both of them within the same week. Anyhow, if you're into the bittersweet genre and crave romance that involves profoundly heart-wrenching moments, then both of these (+/- 2-hours) anime films are worth seeing! 
After watching Kimi no Na Wa, I proceed to watch Koe no Katachi.I was like ""Wow. They're actually somewhat similar in comparison."".Heartwarming, yet subtle, focusing on our main hero and heroine.One about deafness and other switching bodies.I think its ""trouble communicating others with a disadvantage and you really have to know a person to understand their struggles"" sort of thing. 
Not similar in the sense of storyline, but a sort of similar style. Both deeply moving. Both involve two main characters and their journeys of understanding themselves and those around them. 
Telling and loving are relative. Nobody care mistake. Stand up, children.Both are legendary anime movies which released in same year. Despite different themes, really similar style.However, Koe no Katachi is more mature and heavy. Kimi no Na wa. is more romantic and touching. Nevertheless, great contents.You'll love each Shouko and Mitsuha because they have established personalities. Both main characters are firm.I can't say more than this. Please watch them. If so, you can understand why they're masterwork. Thanks for reading. 
Both movies are about a tragic love story.  Other people besides the main 2 characters the romance centers around, are needed to help bring about the happy ending.  They both have high quality animation and art.  I personally prefer Your Name( Kimi no na wa) a lot more and give it a 9/10, but Koe no Katachi is still a good movie and earns a 7/10. 
Both are simply the best movie of their particular years. Both are Oscar worthy. Both share the main theme of high school romance. Kimi no Nawa is more fantasy-like while Koe no Katachi is more grounded in reality.  
Both character is interest.So,girl difference of school or city or village the characters in pairs are different from the other anime.Whereas the voice of language is so polite and well mannered backsound a the soundtrack tt's just the soundtrack manage also very interesting though very remarkable.But that,the emotion of sadness, loneliness, separation, different and so on 
Both will make you shed tears out of your ass. 
If you liked Kimi no Na wa, the chances are you will enjoy Koe no Katachi, another emotion provoking and engaging film. 
Drama and lots of feels, definitely for you if you like tear-jerking anime movie. 
If you're looking for another movie with jaw-dropping animation, this is the one. Both also deal with similar themes of miscommunication.  
every goods at the question slice of life! ( inclused i like every the ""romance"" of koe no katachi, missed the kiss ;3 + 0k ) 
both movies are beautiful just watch for your self i cant explain !!! 
-Both are masterpieces.-Both leaves you wanting more after watching it.-Both makes you want to re-watch it many times.-Both have excellent OSTs.-Both have touching stories. 
both are very beautiful films with great art styles, they get emotional in a similar way 
They're both incredibly well written and stylized movies that will leave you wanting more. They both have very lovable main characters and such well conveyed emotions that you're left feeling a sense of dread that your life will never be as heart-wrenching as these movies. The love stories they tell are beautiful, hauntingly so, and so perfect overall. I quite enjoyed both movies 
They are both movies on touching yet complex relationships and youth. Both center on the interactions of two main characters and how their ideas and morals evolve over time. Both have a twist towards the end that shocks viewers but resolves the major issues in the end. 
These two are similar because they both express a relationship between a boy and a girl that isn't explicitly romantic, but still portray love and support that is really sweet and sad at times. The animation is similar in the sense they are both very high quality. 
They're both beautiful stories with much to offer. Two of my favourite movies of all time for sure!Emotional and tear jerking, I would recommend to everyone of all ages. 
Although the themes of both are widely different they both touch the audience's heart. Your Name and A Silent Voice, both are a romance anime with great art style and story. While Your Name focus has a more lighter and supernatural theme, which tells the story of a young boy and a girl who tries to get used to their new ""body-swap"" way of living, until things take a turn later on. On the other hand, A Silent Voice tells the story of a young deaf girl and a boy who had been a bully in his younger age. They both are full of heart touching and heart-wrenching moments, which might even make you shed your tears but also equally full of heartwarming moments.If you liked Kimi No Na Wa, then there's a pretty high chance you will like Koe no Katachi too~ read more 
Similarities:-Both anime involves a high school life.-Both anime can make you cry.-Both anime's main protagonists may/may have feelings with each other.Differences:-Kimi no Na wa is somewhat supernatural, in a way that their souls is being switched to one another while Koe no Katachi they are not.-Kimi no Na wa's main protagonists are very separate and far from each other, only their connection and communication with each other is writing something while in Koe no Katachi, the main protagonists are nearby and somewhat close.-Koe no Katachi features the plot about bullying and redemption, guilt and repentance of the MC's actions in their childhood while in Kimi no Na wa it doesn't have the same plot as what is happening on Koe no Katachi.-Kimi no Na wa is all about meeting each other and finding themselves while in Koe no Katachi is all about forgiveness and bringing back the brighter connections between the main protagonists. read more 
Taking school life settingsHave impossible love storyAwesome graphic art syle 
They're both movies that manage to touch the audience's feeling in a very beautiful manner 
Basically its love story too, in both movies there is kinda barrier between the two main characters that are supposed to fall in love with each other, but even tho they have to manage to overcome a lot of problems to be together and happy , they can do it. The animation style is similar too in my opinion and its really good artwork. 
Both movies happen in a school setting, and have amazing stories and visuals.Unlike kimi no na wa, there is no supernatural stuff happening, but overall the characters and story itself are better. 
Similar story structure, except for the supernatural element. Purely from opinion here, but even though the story structure of Kimi no Na wa isn't as solid as Koe no Katachi, it is able to convey something that you can relate more to and easily understand, in comparison to the many hidden meanings and social problems presented in Koe no Katachi. 
A beautiful story of two teens coming of age and facing the difficulties of life. 
Oh well. All I can say is they are a masterpieces for anime drama. Altough they have very different in visuals, the development of their circumstance are same especially in romance and daily life. That's how I feel. I highly recommend you because they can make you comfortable in the last part. 
Both movies are set in a school setting, and both movies have intense emotional moments. 
these two are like cursed to each other. Both came out at about the same time, both are emotional drama romances with high schoolers about to enter adulthood, and their both two of the most debated anime on which is better I've ever seen (your names better btw) 
I want to recommend you two anime films at once - Koe no katachi & Kimi no na wa.They are different, but these two films are simply masterpieces, both are simply the best films of their time! Both are very touching, interesting to watch, I really liked these two films, I love them! I liked Koe no katachi more, because Koe no katachi is more based on reality, and kimi no na wa is more about fantasy, that's my taste :)Nevertheless, these two films are simply masterpieces, they are definitely worth watching, I am sure you will love them very much! Recommend, good luck: D 
These are both very popular movies with a heartwarming story of love.  
I 100% Recommend this if your in to a emotional, romance, and adventure/journey kinda movie.  
Although these don't share a similar plot, they're both beautifully done love stories that go hand in hand with the development of the two main characters growing close. 
Just a great movie. If you like one you will like the other. 
if you enjoyed Koe no Katachi, you should definitely watch Kimi no Na wa. the reason why is because they both have a unique plot, relatable characters, some sad but also heartwarming scenes as well.  
Both are movies with slice-of-life slow-paced conversations, with romance between a girl and a boy, and with something unusual as an extra. They have a very similar feel.Kimi no na wa contains a supernatural twist. Koe no katachi is realistic, however the girl here is deaf, and the boy happens to be a bully. 
Both follow a tragic mild romance between two characters, and both are sure to make you cry. Both anime's have unexpected twists within them, and are both beautifully put together.  "
28851,9989,20,"Group of friends torn apart by some event that happens in their childhood.Both story are focus around the female lead that was unintentionally responsible for these events and follows the characters in their journey to fixing the relationship of the group 
Koe no Katachi and AnoHana share similar character traits and senarios. Each series revolves around a group of 'friends' who have cut ties since childhood and brings them together again. These two series also have similar main characters, male lead with a serious disconnect from the real world and a tragic female lead. You get a similar feeling while watching both these series, they're very emotional and dramatic. If you have seen one I would highly recommend checking out the other for a similar story and emotional expierence. 
I got very strong AnoHana vibes when watching Koe no Katachi. Both shows deal with a group of childhood friends who become distant after some incidents in the past, and how they restore their friendship when they meet again in the future.  
Both anime center on a teenage boy who suffers from guilt after a traumatic event in his past and seeks some form of reconciliation and redemption for his actions. Both anime also devote considerable time to that boy's group of childhood friends and how they too have to deal with their own personal demons stemming from that event. Lastly, both anime are very effective tearjerkers. 
These anime share that theme of teenagers struggling to overcome a dark event from their past, for one.But mostly, I got a really similar feel from Jinta's and Shoya's characters and how they were affected by their individual tragedies. They both start out as confident, outgoing little boys-- the ringleaders of their groups of friends. ...And then grow up to be really withdrawn and insecure. It was one of the most striking elements of A Silent Voice for me, and though the focus on that element in Jinta's story is a little more subtle, it's definitely there and reminded me a lot of Shoya.  
It's a tear-jerking story about group of friends falling apart. 
Both are amazing tearjerkers, as they succeed on delivering an emotional roller coaster up until the very end. 
KnK and AnoHana work under the similar backdrop of a melodramatic story about a group of people's childhoods and how their guilt and hidden emotions against each other have caused life-changing scenarios for all of them—and how their coming to terms with their past allows them to move on a new chapter in their lives. 
Watching Koe no Katachi, I couldn't help but notice the remarkable similarities to Anohana. The stories revolve around characters initially as young children when an incident breaks their fragile realities tearing friendships and livelihoods alike apart at the seams. Further, they have a similar time skip from elementary to high school to explore how the characters changed overtime and how the past has affected them. In the end, both are about the perils of life and growing up. There are consequences for every action and life isn't nearly as simple as it was when you were a child. Communication might appear to be a simple task but even as we grow in age expressing emotions and words is arduous and full of unexpected complexities. We all experience pain and the journey to conquer it and redeem our mistakes is at the root of both tales. read more 
This anime shows the fragility of a person will to live, mainly on adolescence, when compelled to deal with the feelings of others. 
a heartfelt reunion to heal from the past 
""A Silent Voice"" is everything I wanted anohana to be.a well-written story about social anxiety, depression and let it the past go...if you are interested in well-written dramas, this is for you (It's also better than 13 reasons why) 
The heroine of the story is a pity girls who are sad, this story revolves around the past and trying to fix them in their teen age when the main character got reunited with the heroine. These two anime are trying to teach us lessons that we shouldn't hurt others. 
Both explore the impact of childhood trauma (death in the case of anohana and bullying in the case of koe no katachi) and moving on from the past. Additionally, both have romantic elements (more so in anohana).  
These animes surprisingly have a lot in common. Both of them deal with childhood trauma and observe the regathering of childhood friends to form strong bonds once again. While these two are quite different (and Silent Voice is ten times better), they still have similarities that will give you certain vibes, but won't make you feel at all like you're watching the same anime. They take different turns but both have finales based around similar concepts. They are, however, quite different. So don't expect them to be super similar. 
Both involve a past incident that defines the current MC. Both are also heavily emotional and tearjerking. Both have social narratives that are much relevant to us today. 
You want to know how to settle up with your ""old friends""?Both have the same situation, where you and your childhood friends grown apart because an accident. 
Both has somewhat similar characters, coming of age, and friends drifting apart.  
Both types of anime solve problems about friendship, jealousy and being together with old friends. Both animations have exciting animations, and have a beautiful meaning too!  
they gave me the same vibe when I watched them, I really think you would like this if you enjoyed Anohana "
28851,36098,11,"The female character completely changes the life of the male character in the story. Male characters change throughout the story from the beginning to the end of the movie.Sure, watching this movie will make you cry and change your view of seeing life, because the thread that separates life and death is questioned.Importantly, people can change the lives of others completely, and the animation shows it. 
Both male main characters at the beginning of the film are socially detached from the world until they meet the main female character- both with a health problem. Both films revolve about friend ship and the meaning of living. 
Both are Movies with God Tier art style!Both have MC that doesnt give a darn about societyBoth have almost the same concept but differs in many ways, Main Dude is ignorant about society and then they suddenly met a girl who at first they thought ""Eh, Just another one of these, ill forget about her later."" but then unknowingly made a deep connection to the girl and actually enjoys to be with her. 
If you like crying or a heavy amount of feels then both of these films have that.Both movies have a string message about doing the most you can in life and some of the struggles certain people have to live with.They both are drama anime with hints of romance here and there. Both also have the male lead who doesn't really try to make that many friends and keeps to themselves, and then they both have the female lead who have disabilities or diseases that they need to live through each day.These two films are really amazing and also have pretty visuals and nice soundtracks and are all together great! read more 
Both are very good movie with a very good story. 
A slice of life movie about a friendship that makes you feel and love the characters along the way. 
Feelings, sad side, tear maker, beautiful characters, the story from the perspective of an apparently bad character.If you liked ""Kimi no Suizou wo Tabetai""""i want to eat your pancreas"" so you will love this one more, and it will make you cry from the things written up.enjoy it  
Both Movies Feature a relationship between two people. Both have a wonderful story about how two people grow and learn how to work with each other. Not existing separately but together. 
Both are very depressing but I think best movies of all. Must watch it if you want to learn about life deeply... 
Great Storyline, Animation. Make people cry like hell, so emotional. Nice Message at the End. 
If you want a sad movie to cry to and ya already saw this one you should try this because its sad and a=changes you're perspective on somethins like like this movie does so yeah it also has great animation  "
28851,33352,10,"Very beautiful, personal stories of growth, self-discovery, and overcoming your past trauma. Top quality animation and art, fantastic directing, excellent soundtracks. These are two of the most personal feeling anime I have ever watched. Lots of great emotion and drama. If you want something to break and then fix your heart, these two are some of the best. Bring tissues. 
Both utilise disability as an inhibitor of mental health and the understanding of feelingsThey explore the meaning of living, both physically and mentally, and highlight the importance of friendships and connections. Although they are set in completely different times, they centralise on the development of human emotion and understanding of circumstance, the effect of history and righting the past. 
-Beautiful art -Beautiful music-Both are full of emotions-Similar storytelling 
Having watched this show I come to think that these 2 shows had a same vibe. The weight of loss, the dramatic and well animated story, the good casting of voice actors. If you were moved by one of those you will very likely appreciate the other. In addition they both feature a disability of their own. I highly recommend that if you liked either of those try the other one. You won't regret it. 
Shows a very sad story of heartbroken girls and how they try to change for the better both make you want to cry at the end  
Similarities:-Beautiful art style-Simple and concise plot-Excellent character design-Fluid animation-a Slice of Life-Great pacingOverall, both programs are extremely well rounded and can be watched by anyone who genuinely enjoys the art, animation, pacing, plot, and characters portrayed in anime. However, these two anime can be emotionally exhausting and really provokes empathy towards the viewer for the characters. I wouldn't be surprised if you cried while watching to either one of these anime (Watch episode 10 of Violet Evergarden and see). I highly recommend these two programs to any avid anime watcher and I assure you that these are definitely worth your investment in time to watch.  read more 
Koe no Katachi is a beautiful piece of art. That's just a basic irrefutable fact. The thing is though, art is something that is continually refined and evolves to become even better over time. Violet Evergarden is a prime example of this. Violet Evergarden has the perfect balance of a great, simple, story and also being visually appealing. By far, Violet Evergarden has the best animation I have ever seen. Both of these shows have great stories, and they tie it all together through the use of art to create a masterpiece.  
-100% will make you cry-great animation -aesthetic 
They both are beautiful animes and are both emotional, I would recommend watching these with tissues and snacks. 
okay so since a bunch of people of people have already made this recommendation, i doubt too many people will get around to reading this but oh well.to be completely honest, the stories don't have much in common other than trying to make the audience cry (which isn't really a bad thing). however, the reason i think of one of these anime when the other is mentioned is THE ART!!! the art is exactly the same!! the same style of drawing face shapes and movements, and most of all the closeups!! since i know many people (including myself) watched violet evergarden because of the strikingly beautiful art style, A Silent Voice has the exact same art style!! (i believe they have the same ""Key Animator"")so yeah, if you like the art of one, watch the other!! hope i helped :)) read more "
28851,31646,7,"Both of these look heavily into self-loathing and self-discovery. They are, at their cores, stories about forgiving yourself and overcoming your own psychological weaknesses. They are about discovering what it is that you want to do in life and what your passions mean. Fantastic directing, art, animation, and style in both. Some of the best at setting a deeply reflective mood. Tons of good drama and character building as well.  
Deals with a depressed kid and really conveys the emotion fantastically 
Both are heartfelt dramas that deal with depression, isolation, and the human condition. They both teeter between heavy and uplifting atmospheres and give off a similar vibe. Season 2 of 3-gatsu also touches upon bullying in a similarly beautiful manner as A Silent Voice does.If you liked A Silent Voice, you'll probably enjoy 3-gatsu and vice versa. 
Both are very personal drama's, that give the viewer credit to infer and which focus on the protagonists emotional turmoil. There isn't a shred of doubt in my mind that 3-gatsu no Lion is the most similar anime to Koe no Katachi in existence. Trust me, I've seen everything considered even remotely similar.BTW:Koe no Katachi - Definitely watch it subbed3-gatsu no Lion - Preferably watch it dubbed 
Both of these animes deal with the consequences of depression and, while to a much less pronounced extent with 3-gatsu no Lion, bullying and feelings of inadequacy. The primary driver in both of these stories is character interaction, which both helps and hurts the MCs. 
A high school student suffering from depression and loneliness has to face his past-self and grow as a person. Both of these are touching anime and if you enjoyed 3-gutsu no lion you're sure to enjoy Koe no Katachi  
Wow, Rei, Kousei and Shouya, nothing more to say about this 3. Struggling with their pasts, feeling guilty, everybody'd love to see their journey to find their true selves and seek for salvation. "
28851,23273,7,"Superficially, we get a melodrama on both shows with a male protagonist suffering from their internal conflicts and a heroine that becomes a catalyst for the protagonist to grow. But why I believe these two are very similar is due to sharing a similar thematic irony. In Koe no Katachi, the protagonist learns to ""hear the world"" from a deaf girl. Likewise, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso has a similar underlying theme as well. Moreover, the animation and OST on both animes are beautifully executed as well.   
Both are about an mc who suffers from a depression and are helped by someone who is entering their life and completely change it for the positive. 
This recommendation isn't to say that you'll enjoy Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso if you liked Koe no Katachi, but if you liked Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, it's very likely you'll like Koe no Katachi. Describing why this is the case is difficult. Too difficultIn both this cases I recommend the sub, although the english dubs of both are also very well made. The issue is that the translations are too literal for Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso and too loose for Koe no Katachi.  
If you want to get very emotional, this is also a good request. 
both heartbreaking anime about a boy and a girl bonding together. eventually, something happens, which make both anime amazing. these anime will affect you and potentially make you cry 
Both are about teens facing their demons 
2 Very emotional series wich i really liked watching both talk about how important friendship can be for all of us :) "
28851,31043,5,"These two are very similar in the way that the mc wants to ""save"" or ""help"" a female character, in their childhood years. Koe no Katachi is more about regret and the mc is trying to make up for it, while Erased is just trying to prevent something from happening. There are no ""fantasy"" elements to Koe No Katachi however. Both are kind of about human bonds. KNK has a more emotional growth to it, while Erased it's just Satoru trying to fix his problem, but not necessarily becoming super close to the girl (they have moments but i wouldn't say theyre close.) Both are good anime!! KNK is slightly better because of that last part I mentioned. read more 
Well, those two shows doesn't look the same for the scenario but have some similar points.1- Those two shows speak about child harassment. The main character will try to save or to redeem himself from the other main character, the girl.2- The atmosphere is oftenly sad but got some funny moments. In those two shows, the main character got a good friend who'll be helpfull (Nagatsuka and Kenya).3- Minor characters look pretty similar, for exemple: the mother is there without her husband and try to help her son. 
Both shows center around the male and female leads early and later lives, with an ominous past relationship and touches on dark topics. 
The main characters focus on helping another person and trying to make up for the past. Dark subjects that many people are afraid to talk about are explored but it's what made the stories as good as they are. How important the actions of just one person can be.  
Fixing past mistakes. A Silent Voice and Erased are both stories in which the MCs fix past mistakes with the aspiration of a better relationship between the MCs.A Silent Voice gives MC Shouya a hard life present time in consequence of his actions regarding bullying Shouko, despite this he aims to fix these mistakes along with Shouko in order to better their relationship. Erased is quite literal in this matter in that Satoru, who travel back to 1988, tries to prevent classmate Kayo's death by fixing mistakes he made at the time.A Silent Voice offers a high-quality animated dramatic, romantic story. With Erased being on the flip side, offering a dark murder mystery. read more "

Silent Voice is between a former bully and a deaf girl (who bullied by the former bully).Both are great visual masterpieces that you can expect to be filled with the happiest of times and saddest, though Silent Voice is more depressing than Promised Flower. 
If you cried with this movie then you'll cry with this. I believe that A silent voice wraps it up more then Sayonara no Asa ni Yakusoku no Hana wo Kazarou. You'll get all the backstory and character development you'll ever want here.  "
28851,1210,4,"Both anime deal with the theme of suicide, as well as a male character being regretful of his hurtful actions towards a vulnerable female character. 
Both are drama dealing with MC's incapability to connect with other peopleBoth feature various people from their pasts bearing importance for their character developments.Koe no Katachi does have way more recent art techniques (and way bigger budget), while NHK ni Youkoso! is recognizably a decade older. 
If you like the realism which characterize NHK ni Youkoso, you will probably enjoy Koe no Katachi. Both also tackle social problems such as suicide, bullying and isolation. Koe no Katachi is the first anime that satisfied me since I've watched NHK ni Youkoso.  
As many have said before Welcome to the NHK is pretty similar to Koe no Katachi. Both of them deal with the issues of social anxiety, suicide and isolation. Although KnK is a bit lighter both of them are just as depressing.If you liked Koe no Katachi you'll definitely like NHK. "
28851,4181,4,"Both has amazing Drama and romance. 
If you like crying, watch these. If you dont cry here, guaranteed, you dont have a heart. 
Both have the same sort of drama and similar feel at some point. 
What is it that you regret? Your past? The people you've met? Yourself as an individual? Can these regrets change you for the better?Clannad After Story and A Silent Voice answer these questions for you, protagonists Tomoya and Shouya slowly venture out for these answers after their depressing pasts of being a delinquent and a former bully respectively.Both are great coming of age stories brought to you by Kyoto Animation about how regrets can change a man forever. "

Both are made by Kyoto Animation with exceptional art style. Both are touching. "
4181,23273,36,"Same feels and void. Both have really good character developments for main male MC. Similar kind of lesson too. As a character, i think female MC in Shigatsu is better than Nagisa. And I think that the story progression in Shigatsu is a tad better. I would say Shigatsu is kind of slow but if you enjoyed the pacing of Clannad, then it won't be considered slow. Beautiful soundtracks in Shigatsu also. Another difference is the seriousness in Clannad usually progresses. In Shigatsu it sometimes gets cut off by some gag humour. But when Shigatsu has to be serious, it does it really well.  
It will wreck you emotionally after making you laugh for most of the series. The cast of characters in both series are not groundbreaking, but how they interact to shape the story (and make you laugh) is what  make each anime shine. If you were to combine Clannad and Nodame Cantabile, I think you'd have a pretty close approximation to Shigatsu~. 
Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso and Clannad: After Story are similar in several ways.Both of these series all build up to a point where the events are dramatic and emotional, as this is seen in the transition from the first half to the second half of the series, along with some comedies time to time. As the story progresses, you start to feel strong emotions within both of these series. With the steady pacing, the main characters develop a lot together. 
Stories about love and hardships, both are filled with emotion evoking drama and tragedy. Main characters try to overcome their past as they face many barriers, hurdles, and hardships. With the help of their main love interest, they try their best to open up a new life in their lives.May require some boxes of tissue. *sniff *sniff 
It's easy to draw parallels between Clannad and Shigatsu. In both, there's a protagonist who doesn't really have a direction in life anymore, with a dead mother and a father who neglects him; while the female lead has a terminal illness and parents who run a bakery.When the two meet each other, their view of life changes, similar to Okazaki and Nagisa. However, you could say that Kaori's personality is the polar opposite of Nagisa. Both are great anime with beautiful soundtracks. 
For me, the first episode was lame, although needed for the fast introduction of the characters. Once you are drawn into the story it becames a masterpiece. Your lie in April is a Slow paced anime that has a character development similar to clannad, hosting a MC which is very traumatized about his past, making it difficult for him to move on. For those who didnt reach the message in the beggining, it all becames very clear in the end. This was quite a ride.  
Watching both of them I had similar feeling. They have got funny and very touchy moments 
Both of them are about girls with a strong personalities.Similar Soundtrack which is in harmony with the emotions. 
Both series are emotional rollercoasters that beautifully execute their dramatic narratives and character arcs without going way over the top and becoming a cringe-worthy melodrama (looking at you Anohana) 
- both male MC are greatly developed as the series goes on- both female MC had a strong character supporting both male MC- both female MC had frail body or some kind of illnesses- both series serves kind of Feels Trip- both OST are top notch and match the situations, totally worth to have them in your playlistsomehow Clannad AS often gets more into seriousness, while shigatsu gives a mediocore dose of humour 
Ok, right off the bat, both are beautiful series with sad moments and tear jerking endings. Both series hold a lot of meaning in them and depending on what kind of person you are, these series can really touch your heart. There are really good life lessons that can actually be learned from both of these series. Both anime contain beautiful soundtracks and really good development for its characters, especially its main male characters. While Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso contains more humor than Clannad, it still does the job well of hitting you with feels. I must warn you that if you are one that hates slow pacing, then I highly suggest that you avoid both of these anime as both of them are rather slow paced. However in my opinion, that's the beauty of these two series and if you like the pacing of Clannad, then most likely you'll enjoy the pacing of Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso. Overall, both series deserve a chance and who knows, it could be life-changing for you. But then again, that's just my opinion. (Note: I almost forgot to mention that be sure to watch Clannad before you watch Clannad: After Story as Clannad is a very important prequel before the emotional After Story.) read more 
-Both have the school-theme-Both have lovely characters that u start liking really quickly-Both have a cute love story that unravels the potential of the main characterand...Feels...damm dem feels  
Both anime's pretty much some of the saddest anime's out there.  Your Lie in April is just 25 episode so it is quicker leader up compare to Clannad which is 2 season 40 plus episodes that build up to some of the tear jerky plot.  Both should be watch in dark room with no one around.  
they arent similar at all not even in tags: Clannad :Slice of Life but (your lie in april): is about music both are sweet and good to follow , in my opinion Clannad is a little bit boring Shigatsu is way better its about Music but they both share a sad ending after all its up you guys . Dudera (ClannadS1&S2) 
-Both deal with the main character having to go through losses of people he cares about-In both, the main character is kind of reformed (Tomoya from a delinquent and Kousei from his trauma of playing the piano) by the main heroine-In both, despite being able to predict depressing events, they still are extremely saddening to watch 
Both shows has amazing character development for their male protagonist's.Both shows has amazing soundtrack's.Both shows leaves you with a sad/void feeling.Both shows has pretty slow story progression. 
Clannad After Story and Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso both hit you with the feels hard and often. They both have a lot of comedic moments as well. Both stories are about overcoming barriers in life. Both male MC's develop a lot through the anime with the help of the female MC. Both female MCs are ""out of this world,"" although through different ways, and both help their respect male MCs to see the world differently. Also, both female MCs are fragile and have illness and also have bakery shop owning parents. 
Both are dramas, romance, and sad. Both have compelling stories and great character development. Your Lie In April is far better, the only big difference is that Your Lie in April is very music oriented, but that's about it. 
Really similar in terms of plot and characters, female MC a bit more developed compared to Nagisa, but eh. 
This anime has a very different plot, but gives you the same feelings as Clannad After Story. I loved them both. There are events in each that are very similar too. I think anyone who loved this anime would also love Your Lie in April! 
Both series are masterfully executed, one demonstrating the value of family and the other demonstrating the value of friendship. Out of all the heartbreaking anime I have watched, these two stand as the definitive tearjerkers amongst all the rest. They both contain remarkably strong soundtracks, perhaps the greatest I've ever heard, and outstanding character development of the protagonist. A common theme established in both works of art is the devastation and despair that is accompanied with loneliness, and the conviction that one individual is capable of changing another's ideologies and lifestyle for the better.  
The feels!! Just the huge impact on emotions. I seriously cried a bunch from both xD 
Very similar, both were tear jerking af! Both these shows are master piece belonging to the same genre and their rating justifies that 
Your Lie in April:If you like sad animes then you must watch this one.Genre-Shounen,Romance,Music. 
Both series involve comedy, drama, romance and a story that will tear your heart in two. The characters are relatable and 3D. Whenever there is an upsetting moment in either, I was left distraught mainly because of how the other characters felt and how easy it was to empathise with them. In terms of soundtrack, both are astounding. Both of the openings fit perfectly with the shows and good in their own rights. The OSTs for both are spectacular in their own, unique ways. Clannad involves music that will make the scenes even more of a tear-jerker. Whereas Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso has a many genres of music within the OST, which fits the show.I chose After Story, rather than the original Clannad series, because of the way it makes you cry or at least want to. Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso is very similar in that way.   read more 
In addition to making you cry, this anime brings incredible songs and beautiful drama with a touch of romance. 
Both are very deep and emotional , a must-watch 
Both MC's deal with trauma from their past until one day a girl comes into their lives and seemingly changes them for the better. There's heavily relatable characters whom have to struggle with overcoming their grief. Lastly, both series are just incredibly sad and probably will leave you a mess. 
Both feature the most meaningfully tragic but beautiful stories ever told through captivating animation, characters, and soundtracks.  
I couldn't stop my tear drops after completing this series ... Really , it's a masterpiece. It's pretty similar to "" Your Lie in April "" too based on story processing , love , romance, emotions, school life etc. But remember, if you want to get the complete feelings and emotions of this series , then you have to watch "" Clannad "" first and it's a must to all of you. At last I want  to tell you that , don't even dare to die before watching this series. If you do that, then you will regret for it later and I can give 100% assurance of that to all of you for that. Really, man....I'm in love to this series...!!!!   Best of the luck....Arigato read more 
Both of these anime mainly focuses on the aspect of the distress the world can give you. Basically it gives both of the m.c's the meaning of love, and being love, and being able to deal with the outcome. 
Dealing with unresolved feelings is hard. Whist in Shigatsu there's a lot of emphasis on the ""how"" it's done after the damage has taken place, Clannad (and :After Story) is overall a better journey through the beginning, middle and end. 
You probably came into Clannad: After Story knowing it's sad, well the same goes here. You get some setup to build the relationships between the characters and understand them better, then depression hits. 
They are both immaculate storytelling and tell the story about losing a loved one. Both OSTs are very powerful, as well. 
Both animes are very sad have a very beautiful romance story. 
Both anime start of light-hearted and funny, but as they progress they become a lot more dramatic. By the end you will most likely be an emotional wreck so be careful going into these anime. Both Tomoya (Clannad) and Kousei (YLIA) have no direction in life until they meet Nagisa (Clannad) and Kaori (YLIA) who give them a reason to keep going. It is around the second half of each anime that the tone shifts and they transition from comedy to drama. They are both two of my favourites, Clannad being #1. So if you like one you'll most likely like the other as they share a lot of similarities. Be sure to watch Clannad before Clannad: after story (It is worth the wait). read more "
4181,9989,35,"Both will make you cry with their tales of love and loss. With the help of a supernatural force, the characters learn to cope with their grief and accept the fate of their situations. 
I have a feeling that Ano Hana is like Clannad in the making. Maybe the atmosphere they give off? Anyway, both are awesome (so far Ano Hana is doing good). Quite the drama too. And yeah, both have deaths in it.  
Both stories involve strong romance and friendship. They'll rip out your heart, throw it against the wall, and step on it without giving you the chance to grab the box of tissues. And it will probably do it several times. If you like one, you'll like the other. Just be sure to have the box of tissues ready beforehand.  
When watching Ano Hana, it gave off the same atmosphere as After Story. They both involve a group of friends and love between two that ends tragically. There is a lot of drama in both and they will also make you cry. Ano Hana was the only anime too make me cry since I watched After Story, and that was a couple years ago. They are both amazing shows that will captivate you to want more because you finished them in a day. 
Both of these anime unlocked the gate to my eternal manly feels. If you love a good old masculine cry, then these two anime are similar in that aspect. I suggest you do not watch Clannad: After Story before watching Clannad, so if you want a small one-night feels anime, watch Ano Hana. Both of these anime intentionally make the audience cry. If you bottle up your feels, you may find trouble enjoying either of these.  
Dramatic plot development that feature friendship, family, using a small bit of supernatural plot device. You will undoubtedly encounter some intense catharsis along the way of watch both.  
Lemme get one thing straight. Clannad After Story and AnoHana (abbreviation) will make you cry your little anime-loving eyes out just by how good story is.Now here are some examples why they are similar:1. Drama Lots and lots of DRAMA. Yup.2. The Atomosphere You have a kinda heavy atomosphere that gets light hearted at some points.3. Friends  Friends are not as close as they are after an event. 
They're both deal with some type of loss and the struggles that come with it. Anohana will definitely have an impact on you mentally and physically, that is if you do start bawling.  Also, the concept of strengthening their bonds  with one another is definitely there. Oh, but I  personally believe that anohana  gives a bigger impact than  clannad. 
Well first of all, they both made me really sad and teary ;~;.They both involve death, and love. They also have a triangle relationship between the main character, his lover, and his childhood friend. (Sorry, not really accurate! Trying to not give spoilers). They both have fantastic artwork. They are both rated 10/10 in my personal anime list!If you enjoyed Clannad I'm sure you'd love AnoHana.  
Clannad Afterstory is the sequel (second season) of Clannad. What makes it similar to Ano Hana is that they both utilize drama and emotions to their fullest potential. These are tales of love and family, friendship and loss, that will take you on a roller coaster of emotions as you walk with the characters from the first episode to the last. Both shows utilize their soundtracks and music super well to support particular scenes appropriately and to convey a message. There are also minor touches of the supernatural used to support the story, yet make the shows unique in their own ways. These are both shows that I wish I can re-watch from scratch without any memory of it! Because the journey was simply phenomenal and once-in-a-lifetime like!  read more 
For me, at least, the only downside to Clannad: After Story was that is did indeed have to come to an end, leaving a void that simply could not be filled by lighter-hearted fair. Anohana was the show that broke the Post-Clannad void for me. I can sincerely recommend both shows for anyone with the desire to cry literal buckets of tears (unless your heart is a brick). 
Though this story is rather different from Clannad. It has the same level of emotion. I'd say it's like as if someone where to condense Clannd into 11 episodes, it would give you Anohana. It's basically a story about Friendship, rather than Romance, which, I feel touches a wider audience, and the backlash of losing something (or someone -spoliers-) who you hold dear. After watching Clannad, and you feel like finding an anime to fill in that void, look no further, because Anohana, WE FOUND YOU! 
both stories about friendship and relationships that will have you tearing up. 
Both anime have a very strong sense of drama, and both stories feature an exceptional power to hit the viewer in the feelings. They can make you laugh, smile, and cry - as you find yourself to be in an emotional rollercoaster. You will probably cry watching both shows. 
good anime about life, friendship, and love.focused on one male lead charter who helps his female lead character.both anime has a great set of supporting cast of friends to help the lead charters develop, while they themselves develop in the process. 
If you feel a empty place in your heart after Clannad After Story and you're looking to fill that place with an anime that will gave you the same feeling then I can only think of one anime that's on the same level: Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai. Even if at first they give a different impression, both series explore similar themes like family, friendship, loss and forgiveness and they're more related that you'd think. 
Same feels and void to both anime. Impeccable character development to a very 'human' cast. In both series the protagonist is a generally unhappy person, whether its because he has lost someone, or he is generally unhappy with his life. Finally, they both have supernatural elements, which influences the story. 
Both are tearjerkers.Both are tragic love stories full loss. Supernatural forces are involved as the main character struggles to deal with the pain. Both shows are absolute masterpieces, Clannad is longer and has more development whereas Anohana is short but doesn't fail to make you cry. If you like one, you will love the other. 
Both shows will hit you at an emotional level. I'd recommend Clannad to anyone, but I can only recommend Anohana if you have a very high tolerance for overdone melodrama. If you like your drama to have a sense of reality and elegance instead of having the show shove obnoxious and unjustified crying down your throat, then I would not recommend it. If you just want to turn your brain off and enjoy good animation, amazing music (especially the ending theme like oh my god it's so good), and formulaic tugs at your heart strings, then I highly recommend Anohana. 
Both have emotional stories and while at first, they both have unrelatable characters turn out to be really good and highly memorable. Both will have tear-jerking moments. This may be a controversial comment, but I cried more for Anohana, and unlike the Clannad series where you have to go through 44 episodes, Anohana only takes 11, so it is at least worth the watch. 
-Both are really emotional-Will hit you in the feels-Satisfying ending 
if you are looking for a anime that will make you cry both of these are perfect for you. 
How did your Tears Taste? Good? Want to try some more? You do? Watch this one :3. 
These are two relaxing slice of life with fantasy & reincarnate. 
Clannad: After Story and Anohana are both very emotional anime's.  They are both in the genre of slice of life.  The characters in each deal with happiness, confusion and loss.  They can be very exciting and happy at times and at other times it is extremely sad.   There is death in each anime where the other characters have to learn how to deal with their deaths.  They go through Denial, Anger, Depression, and Acceptance.  I believe that these anime's are very similar and if you liked one of these you should try watching the other.  They are both very good anime's. read more 
Both shows show off massive loss, probably made a lot of people who watched it cry as well as featuring great developed characters and good relationships.....Did I mention the potential crying? 
Both focus on the hardships of the main characters, and both are slices-of-life that will play with your feelings.  
If Clannad: After Story had you in tears like me and you're looking for something else to crush your feelings look no further than AnoHana. A memorable tale of friendship and romance that vividly highlights the struggles of getting over the death of a childhood friend, and how it can affect the lives of everyone they knew. Very touching and twice as beautiful if you can relate to the feeling of loosing a close friend... 
Both of these series will make you cry like a baby that is really all you need to know. If you need a anime to fill the void from Clannad watch this. You wont be disappointed. 
If you want to sweat through the eyes kkkkk, these animes is what you are looking for. Beautiful, exciting stories that tinker with your emotional. 
They both have two of the best dramas stories ever made, in my opinion; I would certainly recommend these two excellent works !! 
This series really make you crying especially endingHave supernatural genre 
-DRAMA/SUPERNATURAL Good combo-Both got strong romance and friendship-Both protagonists had been forced to accept the fate of one character-Crazy good climax scene on both anime-Clannad:AS require you to watch the first one to get the maximum output of the scene significantly while anohana are easier to watch but it's not as good as clannad:AF ( but it's still good ) 
Anohana and Clannad share the same type of sad feel because as well as sadness and despair, there are important morals along the way.  
I f you want to watch some heart-warming yet tear-jerker romance anime like anohana, Clannad: After story is the one for you. "
4181,10162,11,"- Family.- Responsibility.- Coming to terms with taking care of a child.- Heartwarming.- Slice-of-life, comedy, drama.- Good parent/guardian.- Adorable daughter. 
While Clannad After Story is not entirely about raising a child, it does spend a significant amount of time developing its adolescent character. If you liked the parent concept in After Story then you will enjoy Usagi Drop as the entire show is about what it's like to be a parent. Both anime display great emotions that will make you both happy and sad throughout the journey. 
Anime that tell a story about how a single 20-30-year-old man raise a very young child alone. Both stories take audience through the hard yet satisfying trip known as parenthood. 
Usagi Drop is also about a single guardian raising a child, and it has a similar feel to it. The stories are both heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time. 
Both focus on the challenges it takes as a single parent to become a blissful family after tragedy of some type, though Clannad 2nd season can be grim and not for the light hearted. Clannad 2nd season's main focus is more drama and romance for the beginning majority as well. Although both do have very enjoyable prevailing slice of life theme too. Excellent voice acting for both series. 
If you can't get enough of the cuteness of raising a little girl, you should definitely watch the other. In both series, a single father starts to raise a cute girl around 5 years old. Both fathers go through significant character development after taking on their new roles. The challenges and emotions of this are portrayed heavily.Be warned though, Clannad: After Story has a lot more drama and tragedy. Usagi Drop is a happy walk in the part by comparison. 
This anime has some of the same the father-daughter cuteness going for it. The main characters both learn and grow a lot from the beginning to the end of both shows. Once you, personally, have finished both of these shows, you feel as if you know more about yourself and what you value most in life.  :) 
Both have as main theme the importance of family, especially the parenthood. How both shows portray the way of the main characters of fighting to grow up a child is superb in their own way, while Clannad: After Story is extremely dramatic and a truly masterpiece, in contrast with the kind slice of life pacing of Usagi Drop.Remember to watch Clannad first. 
DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED CLANNAD: AFTER STORYIf you liked the last part of Clannad after the turning point, you will really like Usagi drop. The entire anime is about the interactions of the two characters in a unique way for most anime. However for the most part where Clannad had a heavy sense of regret and sadness in it, Usagi Drop is much more light hearted, although still relatively serious discussing some topics about how children treat each other, and later on how adults treat each other too. The specials weren't bad either, even though they were to short to get any real story or meaning into. They did give some happy scenes between the two main characters. read more 
Both the shows deals with an adult raising a child. While usagi drop is a light hearted show whereas clannad after story is very dark. The setting in clannad after story is different but the premise is same. But beware of you wish for an ending that feels good then don't watch clannad after story. The hardship faced by a working adult while raising a child is shown in both the anime's. 
The main focus of both shows involves family relationships, responsibilities, and wholesome moments. "
4181,12355,8,"Both have similar topics. When a person losses someone they loved and have to raise their childrens on their own. Extremily poweful and heartbreaking. Cute childrens ( ushio, ame) that have sad stories on their own. Both have a fantasy but intead of making the story boring and unrealistic, make it more powerful.If you like it, you will definetly like the other. 
Similar emphases on family and both leave you with a similar satisfying feeling. Plenty of drama, heartbreak, and a little comedy to make these slice of life stories about families growing up some of the best anime there are. Clannad After Story has more romance and much more drama while Wolf Children has more emphasis on the kids growing up and discovering who they want to be. 
Both involve a parent raising their child (or children in Wolf Children) whilst overcoming their own personal issues. It's difficult to say exactly how similar the two situations are without giving huge spoilers, but they're pretty similar.Also, both series have a fantastic soundtrack and incredible animation, and they're both extremely emotional watches. Chances are that one or another might make you shed a tear at some point. And if you were left with somewhat of a void after watching either CAS or WC, one of these will probably fill it.(Bear in mind, though, that if you're going to watch After Story, it might be an idea to watch Clannad's first series first). read more 
Everyone takes away something different when watching a series. When I think I found a new favourite, I really ask myself, what was so great about what I just watched? What about it moved me so much? I ask myself that of Clannad: After Story (CAS) and Ookami Kodomo no Ame to Yuki (OK).CAS and OK have very sad and poignant moments. OK has the saddest opening I've seen to date. CAS made me cry at the end. Without revealing the plot, tragedy strikes and the story telling is very well done in both.Raising a child has its ups and downs and this is well captured in both. There is the ineffable cuteness of a child, the difficulties of raising one and finally the satisfaction of seeing them grow. This aspect is well captured in the narratives and you really get to share in the emotions of parenthood.So, if you watched one and felt really emotionally moved by the sad moments and parenting, you will no doubt enjoy the other. read more 
Both anime have a heavy focus on real-life struggles, though with a bit of magic sprinkled within the plot. They're also massive tearjerkers with somewhat ambiguous endings, though Wolf Children's is less controversial. And finally, both of them are about learning to continue hoping and carry on, even in the darkest of moments - wonderful art pieces of inspiration and love. 
An even more powerful, even more pure, beautiful film about parenting and romance. Clannad: After Story has the emotions, Ookami Kodomo No Ame to Yuki has it too. Both are Slice of Life genre. Clannad and Clannad AS are both about family and children, so is Ookami Kodomo No Ame to Yuki. Both are at times funny, romantic, sad, tragic and joyous. Both are highly recommended. 
Both have similiar topics the importance of family and the struggles of adulthood.Also both have a fantastic soundtrack and incredible animation and they're both extremely emotional scenes.If you like it,you will definetly like the other 
One of the hardest things in the world can be raising a child. It only makes it worse when said person is struggling with life already as it is. These statements are well presented in the stories Clannad After Story and Wolf Children.The struggling parents Tomoya and Hana go through a majority of ups and downs in their seemingly lives full of despair. And whilst they go through parenthood, they too, proceed on a path to go over new lessons in what being a parent means.Both are great visual pieces with heartfelt moments around every corner of the movie. "

Beautiful stories evoking emotional response 
Both shows have the same feel to it. Watch the prequels first. 
Slice of life with a tremendous emotional plots and a lot moral lessons. Clannad After Story is more focused in romance, Aria is focused in the daily lifes of the main characters, both anime series tell the happy and sad experiences of the main characters.  
The core of both series centers around their characters growing and becoming better people, experiencing a new understanding of themselves that become obvious in retrospect.The stakes of both are simple and down-to-earth (humanity is never at stake).  The drama in both series is often understated (especially in Aria).  They both aim to convey something beautiful about life, and if they succeed for you, you might change certain ways how you act or think.They convey in deceptively straightforward but profound terms the beauty and meaning in family or of teaching. 
Both series are affected very important things that make us think about real life.A masterpiece is on the same level with Clannad: After Story. "
4181,9253,6,"Both have the same sort of drama and similar feel at some point 
Both have incredibly well-developed characters, and deal with parallel dimensions. NOTE: Watch Clannad before watching After Story 
These animes give a strong feeling of love between two people, as well as the love in a friendship. So strong in fact that this love makes the characters overcome obstacles with it. At the end I guess they are just both very moving. 
firstly I just have to say you should obviously watch Clannad first before you watch the after-story.-Clannad after story and steins;gate are light- hearted and happy at the start- however they then gradually get more and more dramatic until you are practically on the floor crying your eyes out-the endings are brilliant and make you feel completely satisfied with life 
-Both have drama-Both have romance-Both have the main character thrown into serious depression because of the loss of anotherAt first this may seem like a weird recommendation, but I know a lot of Steins;Gate fans who love Clannad, and vise versa 
Clannad After Story and Steins;Gate are two anime series based on visual novels that deal with bittersweet romance. While Clannad After Story doesn't deal with time travel in the way Steins;Gate does, it does explore multiple timelines of Tomoya Okazaki's love life. In keeping with the spirit of the visual novel, the anime adaptation will show off the different ""routes"" that were available in Tomoya's life. After Story is a sequel to Clannad, however, so it won't be entirely welcoming to new audiences unless you've watched the original anime first. "

If you loved Clannad: After Story, Violet Evergarden is for sure the next anime you would like to watch. Violet Evergarden is also produced by Kyoto Animation, one of my favorite studios. It has one of the best animations I've ever, beautiful soundtrack, and tells heartbreaking stories just like Clannad does. It just has 13 episodes, so there's no excuse to not watch it. Give it a chance, I'm sure you won't regret it!

Romance, comedy and realistic human interaction at its finest. 
Constantly searching for a meaning of something is difficult. Clannad After Story and Violet Evergarden are no exception to this standard.MCs Tomoya and Violet proceed on a long trek in finding their meanings relevant to their lives, whether that be about the people closed to you or what love is.

Most people would say there not the same but Both of them have a deep love story behide them and alot of tragedy . both will make you laugh , cry and make you feel connected to them 
Both series are explorations into what it means to be in a relationship and what it takes to make it work amidst the turmoil that is life.

If you like Nana, you should watch Clannad for the back-story then watch Clannad After Story and enjoy the soul-crushing void that comes with it.

If you like crying, watch these. If you dont cry here, guaranteed, you dont have a heart. 
Both have the same sort of drama and similar feel at some point. 
What is it that you regret? Your past? The people you've met? Yourself as an individual? Can these regrets change you for the better?Clannad After Story and A Silent Voice answer these questions for you, protagonists Tomoya and Shouya slowly venture out for these answers after their depressing pasts of being a delinquent and a former bully respectively.Both are great coming of age stories brought to you by Kyoto Animation about how regrets can change a man forever. "

They both also spend a lot of time with families who are not their own but treat them as such, the Kawamotos and the Furukawas.A lot of heart and emotion are put into both series. Even though After Story takes place over several years and Sangatsu only takes place over a few months, they're both equally effective in conveying emotions that anyone can relate to. I see people trying to argue that one is better than the other which makes no sense to me because both shows are excellent and if someone like one then I'm cetain they will love the other. read more 
3-gatsu no Lion is like Clannad: After Story but handled right in every aspect. 3-gatsu has richer character study, beautiful art (both character and background), and - most importantly - cute girls without eyeballs covering their faces.They're both emotional rollercoaster when it comes to enjoyment. While Clannad: AS uses spiritual elements to its plot, 3-gatsu in the other hand uses a realistic approach just like any slice of life shows out there. 
Both are masterpieces While clannad after story uses real-life situations and uses fantasy, march comes in like a lion uses real-life problems without fantasy.Both kind of give off the same vibe because both shows make us understand how the characters feel and the visuals are very beautiful.While I like clannad after story more, march comes in like a lion made me cry around the 4th episode while clannad made me cry more around the second half.  "
4181,36098,2,"In these shows, an initially apathetic main character is taught to cherish his life and those around him by a sickly girl. Through the moving, and at times silly, experiences of the main characters, these stories show that even though happy times may not be permanent, hardship can happen at any time, and those dear to you will die, every moment is worthwhile. 
Both are heartbreaking pieces of art, with an amazing storyline and lots of tears along the way "
4181,32281,2,"The artstyle are very similar with the surrealistic drawings that draws you into the scene; very detailed. The stories deal with a normal world and another vaguely explained world. The way everything works is not put in front of you and requires you to activate your brain and think things through; maybe even doing research. The stories are very powerful and both activate emotions very easily. The biggest difference is how Clannad takes the emotions very far and toys with your heart, while Kimi no na Wa takes simple steps to trigger a lesser level of sadness. 
- Tragic events with the main characters lead them both to end up changing their fates- Both are emotionally powerful "
4181,918,2,"You laugh. You cry. You feel hyped. You feel excited. You think. You let your emotions out. Being my favourite and second favourite anime i can certainly say that they bring out everything you have with great characters 
Gintama and Clannad AS story demonstrates the pinnacle of the importance of family & living. Without a doubt, both animes are Masterpiece tearjerkers. The OSTs & openings are on such iconic levels that just listening to the OSTs alone can bring one to tears. Clannad AS & Gintama both execute their narrative in a unique fashion; bringing out happy moments & emotional moments in a perfect blend that leaves the audience desiring more animes that brings out similar tones & themes. Just like the first season of Clannad, Gintama starts off with a lighthearted tone with many comedic moments & unexpectedly hits you with emotions. While people may think the comedic tone hinders with the drama that comes with Gintama, the happy moments actually intensifies the serious moments. Gintama handles mature themes that you wouldn't expect from a ""comedy anime"" and does it better than 98.5% of animes listed on normies' favorite lists. Don't think Gintama as a comedy but rather as a life reflected into an anime. To dismiss Gintama is to dismiss another masterpiece. It's literally not an exaggeration that Gintama can make you cry very intensely in less than 10 minutes. To prove that point, look at the number of 10s it has on MAL & the number of spots it holds on the top anime list. If there are 2 animes in the world that a person should watch, it would be Clannad & Gintama. As you may or may not heard, Gintama is fairly slow but, each episode actually gets better as you keep watching. Just a warning, watching Gintama may raise your standards to the point of making other animes look like child's play. Advice on starting Gintama: Either Skip Ep 1 & 2 (Fillers) then watch the entire series or start watching at ep 25 then watch the entire series.  read more "

Promised Flower's Iorph Maquia also endures this pain as well as the differences in races in who she is raising.Both are great anime with the same emotional ups and downs parents and children can feel alike. 
Both revolve around that family aspect and is a great movie to watch for a good cry. A big difference is the setting though since this movie is more fantasy.

918,11843,42,"Exactly the same kind of humour, but different setting. 
Kimi to boku meets Gintama.boys doing random funny stuff in high school setting.it is from Sunrise like Gintama and shares many staff with it like Takamatsu, Shinji as director,Audio Highs for music and Sugita, Tomokazu and Suzumura, Kenichi as Voice Actors 
Other than the fact that one of the main character is voiced by same voice actor as Gintoki, this anime really does remind me of Gintama, but in an entirely different and refreshing set up. It was also very unique for me in terms of its take on high school girls, most anime I see show high school girls as timid and powerless or outright evil. The comedy is outstanding, there's never a dull moment. Don't give it much thought, just go for it. This series won't disappoint.  
Daily life, crazy characters, a lot of comedy, randomness. 
DanKou and Gintama share some of the aspects as the comedy anime. Although Gintama (and it's sequel) are superbly funny, DanKou's Situational Comedy was similar to Gintama. You got the same director, same music composer, same producer for this anime and the same seiyuus from the epic anime series.  
They nearly have the same comedy sense, it doesn't have any arcs but its hilarious to the core. If you liked Gintama's way of comedy and the way that girl's are stronger than guys, go ahead and watch Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou!  
Jokes' topics, episodic style and pure randomness make Daily Lives of High School Boys and Gintama quite alike in terms of comedy. As for die-hard Gintama fans, these animes not only share Sugita Tomokazu and Suzumura Kenichi, but also voice actors of Sa-chan, Zura, Kijima Matako and even the frigging Shogun! You'll definitely have some fun figuring them out. 
The same sense of humor. Some scenes are totally random, characters have epic inner thoughts about ordinary things and sometimes have the same way of speaking. Both series are very funny and make you laugh out loud. Also you can hear a few seiyuus from both of these series. Hidenori is voiced by Sugita Tomokazu - the same goes for Gintama's main character - Gintoki. There's Suzumura Kenichi (DKNN - Yoshitake, Gintama - Okita), Ishida Akira (DKNN - President, Gintama - Katsura) and Kobayashi Yuu (DKNN - Yanagi, Gintama - Sacchan).And both are made by Sunrise. It explains everything. 
Studio Sunrise animated both of them.Shinji Tkamatsu directed both of them.Tomokazu Sugito voiced Gintoki from Gintama and Hidenori from DKnN.Audio Highs composed music for both shows.Also, same comedy style: mocking everything around them!Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou is Gintama in High school setting. 
The style of parody is really similar to Gintama, not to mention same seiyuu on one of the characters.Both involve a trio and there is no real story to it, but both are really enjoyable comedies all the way through. 
Similar jokes, similar mood, similar directing style. Daily Lives of High School Boys feels like a real-world, modern day version of what Gintama would be if the characters were all in high school (minus the more battle shounen-esque sections). If you watched Gintama and want more of that style of humor, this is a great place to find it. If you watched Daily Lives and want something similar but with more substance, Gintama is the place to go. 
Danshi Koukousei and Gintama are two rare shows in anime industry that make use of situational irony as its main source of entertainment, though Gintama also heavily lean on parody of practically everything. Both shows are mainly episodic, showcasing the main characters' daily lives.  
Made my the same studio and has similar comedy. Both are hilarious! Both have the same delivery of jokes and comedic behavior. If you enjoyed or loved either of these you'll enjoy the other as well. 
Guaranteed to make you laugh each episode. Have a bunch idiot, crazy people that sometime make the ""tsukkomi"" (straight man) stressed. Both main ""boke"" (funny person) voiced by an awesome seiyuu Sugita-san, make it even cooler. The difference is that Gintama sets in ancient Japan, danshi koukousei now. Also Gintama has more development of plot. If you love comedy, you should watch both of them. 
These two series have the same kind of comedy and absurd situations, maybe because they have the same director and Sugita Tomokazu in the lead role (Gintoki/Hidenori).Both are mainly plotless but have some long-lasting stories.Their music (same composer) has also the same perfect way to accompagny the comedy. 
Gag humour that picks up after a while, if you enjoyed Danshi in that manner you will probably enjoy Gintama and get more. 
Both are very funny and relaxing.Differences:Gintama - Is longer and therefore has more deep storyDanshi Koukousei no Nichijou - doesn't have a real plotOverall, they are both great anime and worth your time unless you dislike comedy. 
The style of comedy is the same although different setting. Hilarious anime that will you in tears of laughter.  
JUST DO IT.Everything in Gintama except well its fans and 200+ episodes is in Danshikou. They both have Sugita-san in it, above all else, sexual jokes and some touching or laughable or touching/laughing moments.DO IT. 
My favourite comedy series, altough different in settings (Gintama is set in the Edo period with a twist and Danshi is set in highschool) the story follow tree main chars and their daily lives but here is where the fun begins, every little thing becomes the biggest thing in the universe, every normal scene turns into something comical and everyone is anything but ""normal"".Both share a couple of voice actors (Tomozaku Sugita as Gintoki and Hidenori, Suzumura Kenichi as Sougo and Yoshitake etc), both made by Sunrise.Having a bad day? Start watching this, the bad day will turn into the best day eva. 
Both are freaking awesome :PPlus have the same sense of humour. 
Both shows have similar humor. If you liked one you'll like the other. The director if I am not mistaken is the same as in some episodes of gintama and the voice actor of Hidenori is the same of Sakata Gintoki.  
Same style of comedy, has references to different animes. Both will have you laughing a lot.Gintama is set in a world of samurai and aliensDanshi Koukousei is a school type setting 
Aside from sharing main characters with the same voice actor, you'll find that the humor is very similar in both shows. 
These are one of the funniest show ever made. Gintoki truly reminds me of the cast of DKnN. Laid-back, catches up to the mistake of everyone and makes a joke about it. With the absurdity in this anime i doubt you'll survive. Good luck! 
Both animes have the same type of humor. They are both extremely hilarious with never-ending jokes. Gintama : Gintama is about a former Samurai trying to make a living while being a Jack of All Trades. He befriends two people, Kagura and Shinpachi, and they decide to stay and work with him in the odd jobs they are given.Danshi Koukousei no nichijou (Daily lives of high school boys) : Is simply as the title says. Three friends, high school boys, go through their normal, joke filled days in high school. Wondering what normal boys wonder such as things about girls, food, etc. In these two animes, you will never be bored. Every episode is packed with hilariousness. The main character in Gintama has the same voice actor as the main character in Danshi as well. These two animes are not ones to be missed, they are extremely hilarious. read more 
Well, besides the fact that one of the mc has the same VA as Gintoki, both are pretty funny and has similar kind of humour. The only major difference is the setting. If you really enjoy Gintama, you should enjoy this too. 
Well both of these anime's are made by the same studio, but that's not all infact both of these anime's are almost exactly the same. Daily Lives Of Highschool boys is the same as GIntama in just different settings. Gintama and Daily Lives Of Highschool Boys are definitely in top some of the most hilarious anime's i've watched. Both of the series uses almost exactly the same voice actors which just adds to the similar feeling. At the start of Daily Lives Of Highschool Boys i started to believe it was just a parody of Gintama. These two anime's are by far the most similar anime's i've ever watched. read more 
Both have the same kind of comedy, they both have random daily lives. 
Both are comedy show sharing pretty much the same humour. 
Both are amazing comedies, with our favorite voice actor: Tomokazu Sugita, playing one of the main characters. 
Both are ridiculously hilarious!! Every episode leaves you smiling or even laughing like crazy. Also the VA of Gintoki also voices one of the main characters in Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou. 
Like Gintama, this is a comedy surrounding a group of people and the shows have both like to break the 4th wall. They both (mostly) have episodic humour based around what the characters do in their daily lives. It is directed by the previous director of Gintama and so Danshi Koukousei No Nichijou has a similar style of humour (toilet humour etc).  
It has Sakata Gintoki's Voice Actor, Tomokazu Sugita as one of the MC's. It may not have jokes about random-ass topics like Hemorrhoids which Gintama did but I guarantee you that the idiots in Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou will definitely make you wheeze. 
Both are comedy anime that are hilariously funny and absurd. The main characters even share the same VA(Gintoki and Hidenori.) And both anime are easy to understand and get into. 
the main characters in both series are trios, 2 fun characters: gintoki and hidenori ( both are voiced by sugita), kagura and yoshitake, and the straight normal dude who always gets laughed at or ignored: shinpachi and tadakuni, about comedy, you're going to notice similarities, both series make fun of of other anime and include tons of pop culture references ,sarcasm, satire, and some of the jokes are the same, not to mention both have a crazy cast of women, believe you don't want to mess with them, so basically if you liked gintama, you're going to love this one 
They are similar in terms of:-Gives you a good laugh-Characters are interesting and quirky-Art is nice-Have their own ideas of pranks 
Similarity-leading to unexpected humorous Difference-Gintama has a setting of a company that able to do anything that their customers ask.-Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou is high school setting  Which one is better?sly, you gonna love both of them! 
Both series share the same style of comedy and some voice actors. 
Similar genre,almost the same voice actors,stupid main characters,male characters get bullied by female charactersGintama is about a samurai named Sakata Gintoki and his day-to-day life doing various jobs with two teenagers.There's comedy...loads of it,and there are some tear jearkers and some really good action along the wayDanshi koukousei no nichijou focuses on a trio of teenage boys,their classmates and their various antics.Also it focuses on the Literature Girl who is by far the most hilarious character in this anime 
This show is a must watch if you have seen enough anime and read enough manga. Its humour is similar to highschool boys. 
Both are slice of life shows that make you laugh  "
918,45,15,"Himura Kenshin, once feared as the great assassin Hitokiri Battousai, has now become a wandering ronin who seeks to make amends with his past sins in the Meiji Period.  Despite the official sword ban implaced by the government, Himura Kenshin still carries a ""sakabatou"" (reverse blade sword), and plans to achieve his goal by saving as many lives as he can with his sword.  He instead stumbles upon the Kamiya Dojo and becomes a boarder there.  Both Gintama and Rurouni Kenshin focus on the life of a samurai and how he tries to make his way in the new era after the war. read more 
Gintoki and Kenshin have a great deal in common.  Both are former samurai who were among the most feared by their enemies during a great war.  Like Gintoki, who uses a wooden sword to avoid killing, Kenshin uses a reversed bladed sword, for the same reasons.  There are also many similiarities between supporting characters in the two shows as well. 
Gintama's character structure is completely based off of this story, and you will definitely enjoy to learn where the persona of the characters originated.Overall this is a must watch for anyone that is currently watching gintama. 
The heart of the Samurai - for those who are interested in the way of the samurai should like both series ^^ 
In Gintama and Rurouni Kenshin, the main characters Gintoki and Kenshin both are former war heroes of a great revolution, who now try to enjoy their daily lives as average civilians. Of course, the peace cannot keep up forever, as trouble surrounds these two as their pasts catch up with them.Since Gintama features almost every main character of Rurouni Kenshin either in character, appearance or historical role, yet comically exaggerates their characteristics and throws them into nonsensical adventures, it can easily be considered a direct parody of Rurouni Kenshin. 
1. both shows are about wandering samurai after a time when swords have been banned (but Gintama is more set in an alternate future where aliens have taken over and Rurouni Kenshin takes place in the Meiji period)2. both the main title characters (Gintoki and Kenshin) are extremely strong with a darkish past3. both use historical names/organizations (ex. Shinsengumi)4. Kenshin and Gintoki are both very strong but handicap themselves (reverse-blade sword for Kenshin and a wooden sword for Gintoki)5. Both Kenshin and Gintoki are against killing (Kenshin more than Gintoki)6. Kenshin and Gintoki are very silly/goofy, but when they get serious their whole personality changes7. Both shows are really good read more 
Both anime are set in the same historical period, but with some big differences: while Rurouni Kenshin tries as hard as it can to be a historical accurated portrait of late 19th century Tokyo, Gintama is set in a totally fictional Tokyo where rounins and people dressed in typical Japanese clothes share space with advanced technology and aliens.Also, Kenshin and Gintoki have a very similar past, as both played a leading role in the ultimate Japanese Civil War and became legends; now, they want to leave their past behind and try to live a peaceful life, hiding their scars from the past with a carefree pose.And for the last but not the least, both main characters dropped the katana in favor of non-lethal swords like bokken (Gintoki) and a reverse-edged sword (Kenshin).Gintama is more comedy-driven, while Rurouni Kenshin is more action-paced. read more 
Both about samurai who prefer not to kill people because of a violent past.  Both employ drama and comedy in turn.  Kenshin is more serious than Gintama, which has a lot of silly, immature, or pointless humor (which is, of course, part of its charm).   
Both are similar to each other in a lot of ways.Strong protagonists who have a somewhat dark past.Goofy at most of the times but know when to get serious.And the shinsengumi is involved as well. Also Shisio (Rurouni) is quite similar to Shinsuke(Gintama) 
Both anime series have samurais and dozens of hardcore action battles. 
Gintama and Rurouni Kenshin are alike in many ways.-They both have the same type of humor and use it in the same way.-Both of the MC's have the same type of morals.-Both take place during the time of samurai. 
With a past behind, a war veteran lives in peace until his past finds him again. A samuai in an era without samurai helps those who need your help along with the person who dreams of recovering their dojo. Two anime with different themes but accompanied by good humor and fighting, although both with more than one than the other. 
So maybe you're asking..why you're making a recommendation of these two animes?Well actually even if these animes are very different from each other with Gintama being comedy and serious battle shonen arcs(sometimes):-Both have historical setting..but If you liked Gintama you'll like the references and all the detailed story of edo period, and here it is taken in a more serious way with drama and romance-Both involve samuraiThere are only 4 episodes of Rurouni Kenshin Ova so be sure to watch those 
Both are chanbara (of course) Gintoki and Kenshin both run into a girl and her brother who run a dojo, and Gintoki much like Kenshin meets a sizeable cast of characters that have to help him stop a bunch of people determined to topple society. Gintama is primarily comedic but has quite a few fully serious arcs, and Gintama replaces the Western presence with Aliens (but both take place around the same time, that time being 1840's-60's Japan) 
Gintama basically feels like a parody of Rurouni Kenshin, besides both are great series with epic animation and badass osts with top notch voice acting "
918,30276,15,"Where will you go if all your dreams have been fulfilled? That is the question that both series deal with. They don't have a serious plot, just the daily life of a man who is trying to live his life. There are battles and funny moments sometimes. Recommend to people who are looking for some funny anime to watch to add some spice to their life. 
Although not exactly the same, the main characters of both stories share personality traits. Gintoki and Saitama are not overly concerned over their public image and are willing to blemish their reputations to accomplish a goal. They both also display nonchalance in extreme situations and are also the strongest fighters in their respective universes. Unlike Saitama though, Gintoki has displayed cowardice and laziness in certain situations and will avoid trouble if possible. The settings in each anime are also similar in that they contain futuristic and fantastic elements, such as the presence of aliens and the usage of advanced technologies. Each anime also approaches comedy from a similar angle. Both Gintama and One Punch Man employ satire but through different means. One Punch Man employs satire through character designs whereas Gintama uses referential dialogues and cameo appearances. read more 
The mix between the Comedy and the action If you liked gintama you're probably gonna have fun watching One punch man too  
To begin, both series are super hilarous and share the same kind of humor. Also the two series contains ""serious arc"" wich is freaking awesome! They even have the same kind of main character (Laziness Overload). They are very common in a good way ;) The only difference is in the universe. OPM is the super hero universe while Gintama is the Edo universe.So if you love Gintama, there is no reason to hate One Punch Man! (and vice versa) 
Gintoki and Saitama have a common ideal,  They fight for their own reasons and not to appease others. They are too lazy... Gintoki is lazy by birth whereas Saitama gets lazy as he lacks a serious opponent time after time. They are funny and when they get serious they'll bring devastation upon their enemies. While Gintoki (Shiroyasha)  is a lazy samurai living by his own rules, Saitama is just a guy that serves as a hero for a hobby. 
(Oo I actually wanted to be first to this one; I tried a while back...)But wow, this really is all about comedy, world building, and reasonable characters. The fact of the matter is we have two MC who are heroes down to their very souls but don't acknowledge it with their exterior mannerisms. The irony behind their characters and the world around them are similar and wonderfully uncanny than what we usually see.Gintama is very much amidst the top of the anime industry, and OPM will soon join it. 
While their storylines are rather different, they both offer a humourous take on the shounen genre. Both main characters are hilarious and interesting. There are unique and alien-like villians (and just... characters in general) in each and both feature shounen-like battles (opm more than gintama). If you liked the humour in one of them, you'll probably like the other! 
Do you want a deconstruction of typical shonen clichés? Do you want a OP main character who just don't care about his enemies' complaints or objectives? Do you want to laugh in every scene? These series are for you! 
By far later episodes of One Punch Man really gave me a strong Gintama vibe. Why?* They both are about the misadventures of it's heroes (Gintama with a samurai, OPM with a tokusatsu hero)* REALLY similar parodic humor, including high levels of randomness.* In plot, both would start out without a particular story arc whatsoever until this kind of stuff would later come, while Gintama tries to be more episodic with it's own arcs.* Both also have good fight scenes.There are some dissimilarities, like OPM having less females and a highly overpowered MC, and Gintama touching a lot of references to other series and being more longer.They will not dissapoint in the anime comedy zone and will get you hooked for more. And also, be sure to check out the OPM manga if you want more of it. read more 
Parody genre - ☑MC who are funny & badass when they need to be - ☑ 
-Great gag humor, Gintama has more parody oriented though.-both are comedy shows with action as supporting genre 
Both of these animes are hugely funny comedies with fantasy aspects. I love both of them equally and they both have the same hero. I highly recommend both of them! :) 
Yep that's right Gintama and one punch man are somewhat similar to each other Both of them are { EPIC } comedy  and fighting shows Mind the brackets Epic means Epic both have characters funny and strong but in one punch man i should say super super strong and if you are thinking about comedy then think not all you have to see them especially the face of one punch man character and now about gintama it has broken 4th wall within 4th wall i mean literally it has. Thats why it is also  rated the highest anime above all anime and all the characters will make you laugh (laughing my ass off). Thats all now you have to just see them both. One last thing they are both parody shows of all other shows especially Gintama read more 
They both are very comedic on the ways a ‘hero’ is presented. They are also both very humourus and like to poke fun at the modern superhero stereotype. They are also both parodies. Which again reinforces there similarities. 
Both protagonists are always up to make money, and they both teach you why defending others is a responsibility for the powerful "
918,245,14,"Apart from the main characters being completely random, both series having re-occurring characters and a similar style of humor, there are not too many similarities. However, if you like either of these series, your almost guaranteed to love the other! Both start out fairly slow, so watch at least the first 5 episodes and you WILL be hooked. 
If you liked Onizuka Eikichi from GTO as a main character, then you're definitely going to like Sakata Gintoki from Gintama. Everything they do from riding 2-wheeled transportation devices(I hesitate to call Gin-san's old scooter a bike) to nose-picking to ass-whopping make me think that they must be brothers from different universes. And if you liked GTO's awesome mix of comedy, action, life lessons, occasional ecchi, and problem-solving, then you should give Gintama a shot, because it is all that with a heavy dose of parody thrown in just for kicks. 
Light-headed/carefree main characters, great humor and both animes giving you the chance to review/edit your opinion about life and stuff to do with it. 
Both main characters:*Act like scum.*Can do awkward things without shame*Epic speeches*Overpower pretty much all fights*lazy*scum perverts*have perverted scum fantasies*really really caring of their friends*everyone is drawn to them mystically*hopeless losers*dead fish eyes*make stupid ugly hilariously drawn faces*wear other anime costumes*prioritizes doing the moral thing over importance*both animes don't do cliched things to drag the story*makes you tear up when people discover the heroic things they did*great episodic arc stories*gets mad easilyWhoops, I kept going on. Well you understand how much I love both of these. 
Although these two anime is not similar in plot, the funny moments will remind you again again of each other. If you liked one of them then you are surely to like the other. 
In both anime, the main characters have a dangerous past and are trying to be good in the present. Humour present in both are comparable. 
Both protagonists are helping people with their problems in a similar ""self-sacrificing"" way. Gintama gets real good around after around episode 60, but its so worth it 
They are similar in terms of:-Main character are both late twenties, odd ball, lazy, crazy but they can be very serious when the moment asks for it-Can give you a good laugh as well as a good lesson-There is a bit of action but Gintama has more action 
-Extremely funny-Great episodic arc stories -Epic speeches -Pervert characters  
This anime is very hilarious and i recommended for watch, if you like comedies. Тhank you for your attention 
A anime that will make you laugh and teach us life lessons to understand how this world works. 
- Both MC's are haunted by their past but appear to be goofy- Actual good comedy with a few serious parts here and then- GTO is less dark compared to Gintama 
Onizuka and Gintoki are both the lowest person from Status quo's view but as a humans they are the best, they understand others' feelings and help them realize it. both are very very funny but when the time comes they become more serious then anyone else. In the end they both teaches us to leave according to our own will 
they are both comedy anime with serious scenes and also have similar paradies including doreamon "
918,1,13,"You can beat me up, but they're really almost the same. Firstly it's the plot structure - combination of serious and comedy episodes is the main feature for both, different length (26 eps vs >150 eps) doesn't stop them from showing some bizarre and random unconnected stories for one or few episodes length with some great story line behind the scene. Secondly it's the characters, Gintoki resembles Spike in all respects, they're both easygoing attractive guys with some dark past and fellows that was their friends but now they're enemies; you can beat me up one more time, but I think Kagura was created under the impression of Edward, they're both red, crazy, have some special unique skills and travel with dogs, though the main similarity is the ""crazy"" part; Jet and Shinpachi... I think if you try hard enough you'll find some similarities even between those guys. But the main thing putting those series together is an atmosphere that resembles normal life of mere human without any superpowers, and of course the fact that characters always have problems with supplies and tackle unprofitable jobs just in the cause of their mellowness. By the way, Sunrise is a producer for both of them. read more 
What makes both series similar is the episodic progression of their stories. For instance, most of the episodes are one shot plots that take the characters across the galaxy trying to earn a decent buck while meeting new and old pals along the ride. Each series has it's share of seriousness as well as wacky humor. Lastly, Gintoki and Spike both have fuzzy hair. 
Both have a, for the most part, a stand alone plot structure. Have a surprisingly unique and fresh cast of characters. Are easy to watch/enjoy, and hardly ever get boring.And they both have leads that care MUCH more than they let on...Gintama parodies multiple cultures, stereotypes, and doesn't take itself too seriously.Cowboy Bebop has a breathtaking approach to it's stories, is subtly funny, and ambigously ends. 
In both animes every episode is unique. In different style and without an overall continuous plot. Also the main characters are very similar. Always broke and doing jobs for money 
Both are about chill male characters who can't tolerate injustice. The characters do work and are hungry for money. Kagura is like a mix of Faye and Ed, having Ed's childishness and Faye's impulsiveness and combativeness. 
The similarity lies in the main protagonist of both series. Both Gintoki and Spike are laid-back, cool, casual 20-something year old men who had a dark past. Now, they just find random jobs with their partners and go through their daily lives. They have their fair share of bad habits, but when it matters, they pull through and become badass.  
Both anime are mostly episodic and both mix comedy and action.The protagonists of both anime at first seem indifferent and laid-back,but in reality they hide a dark past and both are skilled fighters. 
they both have short random and funny episodes and good action scenes and in both anime a small group of people take on jobs to earn some money. but gintama has better comedy and cowboy is classy and has more action. but they do resemble each other a lot  
I never thought I would compare them, but I can see many similarities. First, both belong to the same study, Sunrise. Then, in most important aspects, we have the MCs, Gintoki and Spike, both have a sad and dark past who have decided to overcome, but they still feel guilty. Their personalities are similar. They have an old comrade who became the enemy. In both anime, Yorozuya and the team aboard the Bebop, are quite peculiar and charismatics. These groups are poor and unable to complete any work. The series are episodic, Gintama more focused on comedy and satire, accompanied by drama and action, while in Cowboy Bebop focuses more on action, drama and existential questions. Space environment. Well, Gintama and Cowboy Bebop are a little similar, but uniques and highly recommended.  read more 
While Gintama is longer and more comedy oriented (although it gets very serious when it needs to) it has the same basic layout as Bebop. Group of misfits trying to scrape by in life through various jobs, they almost never come out of it with money but there is usually a take away message. You also start off not knowing much about the main characters as their stories unfold throughout the entirety of the anime.  
The two series constantly switch between comedy and drama, being very good at both. Both shows are set in the near future, where our present technology is merged with sci-fi components, like flying cars and space travel. Both main characters, Gintoki and Spike, have a mysterious past and now work as freelancers taking crazy jobs for money - which they screw up more times than not, often because of their sense honor or for just being sloppy. Both are also constantly haunted by their past, in the form of old comrades that turned into outlaws or old friends that passed away. 
- Both have an MC whose past is mysterious and dark- Both animes have both light and serious tones around them- Both have characters that are similar to each other:    - Sadaharu is like Ein as their the dogs of the group    - Shinpachi is like Jet, being the straight man of the group    - Kagura is like Ed, being the goofy kid     - Takasugi is like Vicious, being the antagonist who the MC has worked or fought with - Both animes are based on more or less a free lance jobs where they barely can pay for their needs    read more 
Both the animes tend to provide us with an odd job MC who are gintoki and spike  who though they appear to be lazy they tend to be skilled fighter, with a part dark history related to their past . Both the stories shows intergalactic traveling and aliens too "
918,21,10,"Gotta love the slapstick comedy. ^_^ One Piece has more of a story whereas Gintama is just comedic, but both very funny and enjoyable. 
both main character are very carefree but when serious they are extremely strong. unlike naruto or some other main stream or so, gintama and one piece doesn't have a side talk/story since no one really like it and get on with the main point. although gintama doesn't really have a main point to the story besides the comedy and fighting that randomly occurs 
One piece by story and funny characters similar to gintama TV series but it will never be Gintama :) 
They both have similar storytelling methods. Both animes hardly take themselves seriously and crack joke after joke, but they have serious moments where the viewer can really connect to the characters. 
Both of them, are the #1 Shounen Manga, and the most entertaining animes, ever both have an amazing willpower,if you are a one piece fan boy, try Gintama 
Both are long seriesBoth are comediesBoth have intense actionBoth have a lot of meaningful storiesand both have a lot of deep stories and plot 
-Similar comedic style, though obviously Gintama focuses more on it-Both have characters that make the large amount of episodes worth it-Both dwell into the themes of 'protecting your nakama' more naturally than other shonen 
Sure... there's a large difference, but both are on the masterpiece level both are very comedic and there is action in both animes .Do know that the first Episodes might be slow or average for many people. So it could be for you as well. But it will improve a lot afterwards. 
The humor in both of these anime is amazing. Main characters are both easy-going, but very serious when they need to be. Both shows have a great variety of interesting characters with different powers. Villains are very developed and some make a return later in the series. 
Its long, funny, has a well thought out cast, although nothing can really be similar to one piece, this is another good and long show that you can watch without having any boredom, lots of good fights, comedy and hype surrounding the anime. "
918,37105,7,"one is about college idiots drinking alcohol, the other one is about idiots in general, the one real thing they have in common is that they are fucking hilarious, both make my face and stomach hurt too much because of their sheer stupidity 
Same sort of humor :*Characters are all as*holes with quite a few screws loose.*Masterful subversion of anime tropes*Energetic and excessive*Misunderstandings and overreactionsThese sorta things.If you are an anime afficionado and love absurd humor, then these 2 shows are for you. Might take some time getting into it though, but definitely worth it ! 
Cast of lovable idiots constantly gets into absurd situations that will make you laugh your ass off. 
Golden comedy. While Grand Blue is more vulgar and alcohol dependent, Gintama is more Shounen kind of comedy. Still, alongside GTO and Saiki, those are the best comedy anime I've ever seen 
Both shows consist of over the top comedy, filled with overly exaggerated scenarios and facial expressions. 
Similar to Gintama,Grand blue is an anime that is so funny that it makes your stomach hurt.Weird and funny....... 
Both are about idiots doing stupid things, and being entertained by it. "
918,205,6,"Both are similar in the way that they are both samurai anime with some anachronisms and silly humor with the protagonist being very strong. Even the main girl character of both series eats  a lot.  
Both comedic, but with serious moments.  Both main characters appear apathetic, but in reality feel things very strongly and have a strong sense of duty.  Both main characters are strong samurai with a chaotic style that throws opponents off and are unable to express themselves normally, but seem to do so adequately through their actions.  Etc.  Gintama is a bit more lighthearted and has a lot more pointless comedy, but that is to be expected since it is so much longer.  
Same samurai living concept. Humor in both (more prevalent in Gintama). Both have hungry characters and quite of an episodic storyline. Fights are badass and people chill out when bored.DifferencesSamurai Champloo isn't sci-fi.Gintama is more longer and doesn't focus more on it's soundtrack values. 
If you're a fan of insane action, then look no further! Sorry, that was pretty cliche. But really, the action scenes for both animes are intense. Gintoki and Mugen are both unruly samurais wielding katanas that have only seen blood, albeit for survival reasons. You'll feel the warmth of blood on your hands and the sweat on your brows from all exciting fights. There's a dash of comedy and amazing music flowing from your speakers.  
1. One episode = one story2. Goes through various themes (because of 1.)3. Samurai4. Powerful characters eventhough they can be in great danger5. Some serious stuff sometimesMain differences Samurai Champloo / Gintama :- number of episodes- main story developing slowly, ending fast (3 or 4 episodes) / no real main story- more for grown-up / can be watched by everyone- Samurai / Samurai 
They both are old school anime that have the main protagonist welding a sword with a boy and girl side character and have chilled laid back personalities which makes for good comedy "
918,10165,4,"Both are hilarious comedies with lots of random moments, sometimes not even making sense but still laughtable. While Gintama is more shounen, Nichijou is more slice of life. 
Nichijou is not similar at all in terms of story. However, if you love gintama for it's absurd and random humour, then give this a try. 
Different setting but have same 'WTF' slapstick and random comedy. 
Fun, full of unusual jokes, besides having an exceptional animation that will surprise. "
918,44042,3,"Comedies where the humor exhibits high level of randomness and is based around weird situations. Both also show references to other anime or pop culture. 
Both shows use:-Pop-culture references for comedy-self-aware humor 
-Ambos tienen comedia ridícula y de situación, con situaciones absurdas sobre las cuales se crean ""tramas"". Lo más probable es que si te gusta Gintama, te terminará gustando igual Holo, aunque este último no tiene tantos chistes sucios.  "
918,263,2,"I know what you are thinking:What does boxing anime have in common with a sci-fi samurai comedy? Well to be perfectly honest, almost nothing. If you enjoy each for their story, then this recommendation isn't for you.Now with that out of the way, the reason I recommend these titles together is because they have the same foundation; and that foundation is toilet humor. If you enjoy the perverted jokes that are very present in Ippo, then you will love Gintama, because each episode is about 18~ minutes of that. 
These are the first two anime I would recommend if you have a lot of patience and a sense of humor. Ippo and Gintama both get the ""group of good friends"" dynamic more right than just about any other anime I know, so if you don't mind an anime that likes to have fun instead of always getting to the point, you might want to try one or the other. "
918,5081,2,"Although Gintama may seem totally different from Bakemonogatari, I think they both have an intelligent aspect to them. If you like the drawn out dialogue of Bakemonogatari, I think you'll like Gintama. Bakemonogatari progresses its plot very slowly and Gintama progresses its plot(if there is a plot) very slowly also. They both focus on the characters rather than the environment and the story surrounding the characters. Bakemonogatari has other things similar to Gintama such as 2-4 episode arcs, humorous and occasionally emotional dialogue, and unique characters. If these things appeal to you in Bakemonogatari, I think Gintama is for you.  
Not that similar in any way. But if you're into 4th wall breaking in Anime,you should definitely check these out. I would have recommended the entire Monogatari series if I had the option, but, oh, well.  "
918,22789,2,"The main characters in both series are similar. Gintoki and Handa are adults who I find really alike. They take care of people younger than themselves, like how Gintoki gave Kagura a place to live and Handa entertaining Naru. These two series give off almost the same aura, feelings, and atmosphere. The story is also set in Japan for the both of them. Comedy is something that isn't lacking in any of the mention anime.  Moreover, the life lessons in these anime is the real deal. I truly believe that Gintama and Barakamon are good anime to watch. 
Both shows manage to blend hilarious comedy flawlessly with surprisingly heartwarming depth. Both develop their characters in a way that makes them lovable, and yet we are capable of laughing at their failures. Barakamon is a little more polished in my opinion, while Gintama I more over the top. While there is a huge difference in setting, the themes and core story structure is the same. Again, Barakamon has it's story a lot more fleshed out, while Gintama has a broader view of all it's ideas. "
918,11061,2,"Both shows are light hearted and funny at the same time first but as the story paces, it gets more serious and here's whats interesting: IT GETS EVEN MORE BLOODIER AND BRUTAL. Gintama and HxH has references to other shows but HxH only has one whereas Gintama has a lot including HxH. Gintama and HxH are set in a modern/fantasy setting with both humans and strange beings alike and they participate series of missions/adventures to get paid and to achieve status in society. Both have gangs who have different goals and are supported by unexpected and former allies.  
Henpeita looks like Illumi as a middle aged man.Killua & Gintoki both have white fluffy hair, are undefeatable in battle, & are burdened by memories of a powerful creepy long haired man from their childhoods.Katsura & Kurapika are both androgynous warriors.Okita & Kurapika both seem cute & laid back, but are both quite vicious & not above using people as pawns. Both have a strong moral code, are blonde, & have a vitriolic friendship with a dark-haired tsundere. (Hijikata/Leorio).Biscuit & Kagura are both the strongest women in their series, both redheads, masochists, enjoy trolling people, & act/think way more mature than they look.All of the women in Gintama are violent, mean, & scary. HxH's women would fit right in, especially Biscuit & Palm. read more "
918,2251,2,"Well, the genres are completly different if I may say so myself but when concerning the characters, both anime are on par. Both Gintama and Baccano! have instant love characters and they both invlude characters that are so crazy, it's simply hilarious.  
Is this a bit of a stretch? Yes. But is it wrong? Not really.-The characters are EXTREMELY similar, from the way some of them act and interact to their voice actors-Both start out as comedy but soon dwell into deeper territory, Baccano! becoming seinen and Gintama becoming shonen.-Both take place in time periods in the past, and while the periods and locations are different, they both have a splash of the supernatural added in to spice up the story (or in Gintama's case, open up the setting to make almost literally anything possible) "
918,32182,2,"Both shows are very funny, but sometimes they have serious moments. In both series, attention is paid to ""strange"" organizations, whose leaders possess great charisma. 
Both MCs have those ""dead looking fish eyes"" and both shows are quite funny, but also have serious moments where the MCs show some awesome strength. "
918,4181,2,"You laugh. You cry. You feel hyped. You feel excited. You think. You let your emotions out. Being my favourite and second favourite anime i can certainly say that they bring out everything you have with great characters 
Gintama and Clannad AS story demonstrates the pinnacle of the importance of family & living. Without a doubt, both animes are Masterpiece tearjerkers. The OSTs & openings are on such iconic levels that just listening to the OSTs alone can bring one to tears. Clannad AS & Gintama both execute their narrative in a unique fashion; bringing out happy moments & emotional moments in a perfect blend that leaves the audience desiring more animes that brings out similar tones & themes. Just like the first season of Clannad, Gintama starts off with a lighthearted tone with many comedic moments & unexpectedly hits you with emotions. While people may think the comedic tone hinders with the drama that comes with Gintama, the happy moments actually intensifies the serious moments. Gintama handles mature themes that you wouldn't expect from a ""comedy anime"" and does it better than 98.5% of animes listed on normies' favorite lists. Don't think Gintama as a comedy but rather as a life reflected into an anime. To dismiss Gintama is to dismiss another masterpiece. It's literally not an exaggeration that Gintama can make you cry very intensely in less than 10 minutes. To prove that point, look at the number of 10s it has on MAL & the number of spots it holds on the top anime list. If there are 2 animes in the world that a person should watch, it would be Clannad & Gintama. As you may or may not heard, Gintama is fairly slow but, each episode actually gets better as you keep watching. Just a warning, watching Gintama may raise your standards to the point of making other animes look like child's play. Advice on starting Gintama: Either Skip Ep 1 & 2 (Fillers) then watch the entire series or start watching at ep 25 then watch the entire series.  read more "
15335,7311,2,"Both movies are sequels to their respective series. In both movies, something happens and the protagonist is teleported into a familiar yet different world in which the protagonist doesn't exist. Both protagonists then proceed to make sense of why they are brought here and seek ways to return to their original world. 
In both movies our main characters happen to be to different worlds where no one of those they knew could recognize them, thus making our characters firstly to feel sad and then try hard to change the world! "
32281,38826,41,"It's made by the same director, who pays attention to great details in movies. Plus, that other movie's characters make cameos here.Both movies have supernatural themes, and romantic relationships developing between their poster couples. 
Love stories with a touch of supernatural. Both done by the same director and are awesome movies everyone should watch. They share the same universe(Tenki no Ko has cameos from Kimi no Na Wa's characters) which is irrelevant for the plot but fun fact to know.  
Overall, Makoto Shinkai's films tend to complete themselves, since all the films are set in the same universe. Also, in the search of a visual experience at same level (spoiler: its very hard to find) or if you just want to watch a more deeper story, Kimi no Na Wa probably its the right choice to you 
Same director, same art design and the story structure itself is quite similar 
-Amazing soundtrack-Amazing Artwork-Good plot-Super good climax scene-RADWIMPS/Makoto Shinkai-Both anime focus on the relationship between the two character-Both anime create a supernatural situation 
Both:from the same universesame director and amazing animationRadwimps musicsRomance, drama and adventureVery epic climax 
-Two absolutely stunning movies by the man himself - Makoto Shinkai-A love-story infused with the supernatural and more-High production soundscape and OSTs-Definite must-watch titles if you've watched just one :) 
Very similar and EXTREMELY SAME formula by Shinkai as well. Country kid goes to Tokyo, meets girl/boy, relationship develops, drama happens or lose contact (basically any shinkai film type thing)..... The only thing that this movie has better than Your Name is that: it has action throughout the whole film, better animation (2019), more romance and development, and comedy. Your Name is better at everything else and even the art (not animation) is more vibrant and pretty. An amazing film but almost as good as Your Name. A must watch 
This is an obvious comparison as both share the same visual style and director, but Your Name and Weathering With You are well-animated anime films with themes of romance and the supernatural (the latter is even set in the same universe as the former, though it's not necessary to watch the former to enjoy the latter). Several other similarities are well-done musical montages (as well as RADWIMPS), family problems, an emotionally charged climax, and a touch of Japanese culture. 
Other than the fact that these two were crafted by Makoto Shinkai and his team thus having the same art style and animation, they also contain the same formula and elements. Both revolve contain Shinto religion, both are love stories with supernatural aspects revolving around them, both contain extremely similar story/plot and pacing structure (especially during the climax), and both have RADWIMPS for the music. 
Tenki no Ko takes a more cynical approach to the supernatural, showing what happens when the will of the gods/supernatural interferes in the lives of the modern age.Instead of going on a desperate love quest to look for his destined one, he finds her at the beginning, easy right? Wrong. Life is simply unfair, and much more punishing than that.Overall, I feel like the flow of the story was much more fluid than Kimi no Na Wa. However, I would say the emotional parts aren't as powerful. Granted, this movie works wonders as a sequel, occurring 1 year after Taki and Mitsuha get together.The movie includes more realistic themes than Kimi no Na Wa but requires less knowledge of Japanese culture, because of how the details are strongly implied to you. The movie is even more realistic than the Kimi no Na Wa because of the fact that it's more connected to the city, but the protagonist is just so unintelligent it's sometimes painful to endure.Overall, I would recommend just sitting back and letting the movie take you in. The flow is just so well done. The sound design is brilliant, and the music is just so good of a match. The ending is an acquired taste, but I think a certain appearance will make you grin in your seat. read more 
It's made by the same director, who pays attention to great details in movies. Plus both movies have stunning visuals 
made by shinkai makotoanimated by same studiosimilar animationheartwarming story 
A transcendental love story. Your Name and Weathering With You are both great boy meets girl stories around two teenagers who are caught up in supernatural affairs.Your Name follows Taki and Mitsuha as they continuously body swap with one another leading to a journey to find one another. Weathering With You follows runaway Hodaka and 'sunshine girl' Hina on their journey of helping others via weather changing powers and finding a place to be.Both simple supernatural romance but are visual eye candy with amazing OST, made by the same director Makoto Shinkai. 
Kimi no Na wa and Tenki no Ko are both created by Makoto Shinkai and Radwimps did both of the stunning sound tracks.~ Both are romance, drama, and fantasy/supernatural~ Both have really unique storylines~ Really pretty visuals and amazing music~ Both are really bitter-sweet and are full of feels~ They also both have appearances from characters in other Shinkai worksOverall they are both really amazing films that I think almost anybody could love. 
Made by the same person, very similar character personalities. Art style is amazing in both. 
They are both from the same director. Both of them start using the logic of the real world (meaning that everyone know that time traveling or super powers are not real for example) and then they start being illogical like allowing time traveling for example.In both of these anime the same band sings.Both will make you cry.How the story flows and everything else are really similar in both of these animes. 
Both of the movies are directed by same person.And they both have stunning visual's with a very good story. 
Also directed by Shinkai, has both supernatural and romance elements with gorgeous visuals and storytelling.  
They are both linked and the visuals are absolutely stunning with great stories! Both directed & written by Makoto Shinkai  Production Company: CoMix Wave Films 
both films are very good and a perfect anime for anybody looking for a romance film.  
Both of the movies are directed by Makoto Shinkai, and they exist in the same universe. Bunch of references to the previous movie, similarly beautiful scenery and animation. Both movies are awe-inspiring in similar ways, you will be immersed so greatly that the fictional world will become real and you will wish to share the experiences with the characters yourself. Both movies TRULY AMAZING. 
The awaited sequel to Makoto Shinkai's highly praised and extremely well-received Kimi No Na Wa, or Your Name, Weathering With You has become another prominent movie in the early 2020 movie roster. I personally enjoyed Weathering With You more-so than Your Name, but that might just be my craziness. While both films' plots are debated frequently, the soundtrack of Weathering With You is objectively better, as RADWIMPS have simply outdone themselves in this new story. It might not matter much to you, but the soundtrack of a movie is very determinant in my overall enjoyment of it, and in some cases, can carry a movie the whole way through. read more 
Both are about a mysterious event happening, also a developing relationship between a girl and a boy 
Its another Makoto-goddamn-Shinkai movie, need more convincing?He manages to somehow perfect Your Name's visual fidelity, by some voodoo black magic make it even more detailed than before, with even the skidding of a shoe launching into a sprint off a floor slick from heavy rain looking perfect.RADWIMPS makes a return, orchastrating only another perfect fitting OST for Weathering With You.The only concern you should have is to not ride the tsunami of hype that Your Name brought over into your watching of Tenki No Ko. Its not a sequel, it wasn't written to be one, and should be respected as its own film.You'll want this over any blue sky. read more 
Both masterpieces by the same director Makoto shinkai. 
Both are great romance movies with a side of supernatural on them, they're great starters for people who just got into romance anime/movies, if you have watched the one, you should watch the other certantly. 
Both are made by the same studio and they are about a romantic relationships developing between a couple. They're also wonderfully animated, great soundtrack and there's a touch of supernatural. 
The same author.Same artstyle. You might enjoy Kimi No Na Wa more but it's both amazing 
With the same studio and director, both movies give great detail to the scene and surroundings, making it really enjoyable to watch. The two stories are based on a supernatural idea witch carries the story of two students and the adversities they have to go through.If you've watched either and enjoyed it, the other is a sure must. 
Same atmosphere, same director. Happen to be on the same page, but different timeline. Both about romance, both have some supernatural stuff. 
They both are visually pleasing and surround 2 characters that are brought away from each other and have a journey to get back together. 
This is probably the closest you are going to get if want something similar to Your Name. Its got the same artstyle, director, band doing the OST, and type of plot (romance/supernatural). A definite recommendation! 
Both explore relationships in a fantasy manner and the main protagonists fall for people who seem close but are also quite far away. The animation for both are also really pretty 
They are both made by Mokoto Shinkai and are similarly in plot beats such as that they are both about a romance with some supernatural element.  
Both sad, both very aesthetically pleasing :) 
SImilar romance movies that deal with natural events. Two people who feel out of place find their place due to each other. Also, the animation quality is similar  
The art styles of both movies are breathtaking, and they are directed by the same legend Makoto Shinkai. 
Very similar art styles and genres, both beautiful movies. 
Another movie filled with emotions created by Shinkai sensei. If Your Name made you cry you will tear up watching this movie too. 
Yes, this is quite obvious since both were written by our beloved Makoto Shinkai. In my opinion, ""Your Name"" outclasses ""Weathering with You"" since the latter has several plot holes, somewhat of a disturbing message (sacrifice), and an immature and irresponsible main character. HOWEVER, regardless it is still an amazing watch as the animation is breathtaking! Anyways, if you haven't watched either I strongly recommend. (Also, as a side note, watch ""I want to eat your pancreas"" if you haven't already:) ) "
32281,28851,39,"Both Kimi no Na wa and Koe no Katachi are romantic films featuring young people who are on the cusp of adulthood. They are both emotionally moving with beautiful artwork and animation.Koe no Katachi doesn't have the same supernatural element that comes with Kimi no Na wa, but it has a similar impact. However, while Koe no Katachi is appropriate for adolescent viewers, it does deal with some severe bullying and darker themes that are absent in Kimi no Na wa, so if that is something that is difficult for you, you may want to avoid this film. 
I personally cannot help but be reminded of the other movie when thinking about one of them. Perhaps it has something to do with both films releasing within the same season and me watching both of them within the same week. Anyhow, if you're into the bittersweet genre and crave romance that involves profoundly heart-wrenching moments, then both of these (+/- 2-hours) anime films are worth seeing! 
After watching Kimi no Na Wa, I proceed to watch Koe no Katachi.I was like ""Wow. They're actually somewhat similar in comparison."".Heartwarming, yet subtle, focusing on our main hero and heroine.One about deafness and other switching bodies.I think its ""trouble communicating others with a disadvantage and you really have to know a person to understand their struggles"" sort of thing. 
Not similar in the sense of storyline, but a sort of similar style. Both deeply moving. Both involve two main characters and their journeys of understanding themselves and those around them. 
Telling and loving are relative. Nobody care mistake. Stand up, children.Both are legendary anime movies which released in same year. Despite different themes, really similar style.However, Koe no Katachi is more mature and heavy. Kimi no Na wa. is more romantic and touching. Nevertheless, great contents.You'll love each Shouko and Mitsuha because they have established personalities. Both main characters are firm.I can't say more than this. Please watch them. If so, you can understand why they're masterwork. Thanks for reading. 
Both movies are about a tragic love story.  Other people besides the main 2 characters the romance centers around, are needed to help bring about the happy ending.  They both have high quality animation and art.  I personally prefer Your Name( Kimi no na wa) a lot more and give it a 9/10, but Koe no Katachi is still a good movie and earns a 7/10. 
Both are simply the best movie of their particular years. Both are Oscar worthy. Both share the main theme of high school romance. Kimi no Nawa is more fantasy-like while Koe no Katachi is more grounded in reality.  
Both character is interest.So,girl difference of school or city or village the characters in pairs are different from the other anime.Whereas the voice of language is so polite and well mannered backsound a the soundtrack tt's just the soundtrack manage also very interesting though very remarkable.But that,the emotion of sadness, loneliness, separation, different and so on 
Both will make you shed tears out of your ass. 
If you liked Kimi no Na wa, the chances are you will enjoy Koe no Katachi, another emotion provoking and engaging film. 
Drama and lots of feels, definitely for you if you like tear-jerking anime movie. 
If you're looking for another movie with jaw-dropping animation, this is the one. Both also deal with similar themes of miscommunication.  
every goods at the question slice of life! ( inclused i like every the ""romance"" of koe no katachi, missed the kiss ;3 + 0k ) 
both movies are beautiful just watch for your self i cant explain !!! 
-Both are masterpieces.-Both leaves you wanting more after watching it.-Both makes you want to re-watch it many times.-Both have excellent OSTs.-Both have touching stories. 
both are very beautiful films with great art styles, they get emotional in a similar way 
They're both incredibly well written and stylized movies that will leave you wanting more. They both have very lovable main characters and such well conveyed emotions that you're left feeling a sense of dread that your life will never be as heart-wrenching as these movies. The love stories they tell are beautiful, hauntingly so, and so perfect overall. I quite enjoyed both movies 
They are both movies on touching yet complex relationships and youth. Both center on the interactions of two main characters and how their ideas and morals evolve over time. Both have a twist towards the end that shocks viewers but resolves the major issues in the end. 
These two are similar because they both express a relationship between a boy and a girl that isn't explicitly romantic, but still portray love and support that is really sweet and sad at times. The animation is similar in the sense they are both very high quality. 
They're both beautiful stories with much to offer. Two of my favourite movies of all time for sure!Emotional and tear jerking, I would recommend to everyone of all ages. 
Although the themes of both are widely different they both touch the audience's heart. Your Name and A Silent Voice, both are a romance anime with great art style and story. While Your Name focus has a more lighter and supernatural theme, which tells the story of a young boy and a girl who tries to get used to their new ""body-swap"" way of living, until things take a turn later on. On the other hand, A Silent Voice tells the story of a young deaf girl and a boy who had been a bully in his younger age. They both are full of heart touching and heart-wrenching moments, which might even make you shed your tears but also equally full of heartwarming moments.If you liked Kimi No Na Wa, then there's a pretty high chance you will like Koe no Katachi too~ read more 
Similarities:-Both anime involves a high school life.-Both anime can make you cry.-Both anime's main protagonists may/may have feelings with each other.Differences:-Kimi no Na wa is somewhat supernatural, in a way that their souls is being switched to one another while Koe no Katachi they are not.-Kimi no Na wa's main protagonists are very separate and far from each other, only their connection and communication with each other is writing something while in Koe no Katachi, the main protagonists are nearby and somewhat close.-Koe no Katachi features the plot about bullying and redemption, guilt and repentance of the MC's actions in their childhood while in Kimi no Na wa it doesn't have the same plot as what is happening on Koe no Katachi.-Kimi no Na wa is all about meeting each other and finding themselves while in Koe no Katachi is all about forgiveness and bringing back the brighter connections between the main protagonists. read more 
Taking school life settingsHave impossible love storyAwesome graphic art syle 
They're both movies that manage to touch the audience's feeling in a very beautiful manner 
Basically its love story too, in both movies there is kinda barrier between the two main characters that are supposed to fall in love with each other, but even tho they have to manage to overcome a lot of problems to be together and happy , they can do it. The animation style is similar too in my opinion and its really good artwork. 
Both movies happen in a school setting, and have amazing stories and visuals.Unlike kimi no na wa, there is no supernatural stuff happening, but overall the characters and story itself are better. 
Similar story structure, except for the supernatural element. Purely from opinion here, but even though the story structure of Kimi no Na wa isn't as solid as Koe no Katachi, it is able to convey something that you can relate more to and easily understand, in comparison to the many hidden meanings and social problems presented in Koe no Katachi. 
A beautiful story of two teens coming of age and facing the difficulties of life. 
Oh well. All I can say is they are a masterpieces for anime drama. Altough they have very different in visuals, the development of their circumstance are same especially in romance and daily life. That's how I feel. I highly recommend you because they can make you comfortable in the last part. 
Both movies are set in a school setting, and both movies have intense emotional moments. 
these two are like cursed to each other. Both came out at about the same time, both are emotional drama romances with high schoolers about to enter adulthood, and their both two of the most debated anime on which is better I've ever seen (your names better btw) 
I want to recommend you two anime films at once - Koe no katachi & Kimi no na wa.They are different, but these two films are simply masterpieces, both are simply the best films of their time! Both are very touching, interesting to watch, I really liked these two films, I love them! I liked Koe no katachi more, because Koe no katachi is more based on reality, and kimi no na wa is more about fantasy, that's my taste :)Nevertheless, these two films are simply masterpieces, they are definitely worth watching, I am sure you will love them very much! Recommend, good luck: D 
These are both very popular movies with a heartwarming story of love.  
I 100% Recommend this if your in to a emotional, romance, and adventure/journey kinda movie.  
Although these don't share a similar plot, they're both beautifully done love stories that go hand in hand with the development of the two main characters growing close. 
Just a great movie. If you like one you will like the other. 
if you enjoyed Koe no Katachi, you should definitely watch Kimi no Na wa. the reason why is because they both have a unique plot, relatable characters, some sad but also heartwarming scenes as well.  
Both are movies with slice-of-life slow-paced conversations, with romance between a girl and a boy, and with something unusual as an extra. They have a very similar feel.Kimi no na wa contains a supernatural twist. Koe no katachi is realistic, however the girl here is deaf, and the boy happens to be a bully. 
Both follow a tragic mild romance between two characters, and both are sure to make you cry. Both anime's have unexpected twists within them, and are both beautifully put together.  "
32281,36098,8,"Both stories are wonderful and very exciting. You can't help but fall in love with the characters. The animations are similar and the story is moving, too. 
Both of these movies are great love stories with plot twists and moments to make you cry. Although the plots are a bit different and the conflicts are different, I believe that if you like one of these movies you'd like the other. Both have very beautiful visuals and the songs/ost are very similar. 
its a more defined version of your name , its not a too typical of a romance movie and its special in its own way . 
- similar vibes- both have good animation and styles of animation are kinda similar- similar feels - both include romance -both have good music! (actually quite similar music at some points)- great plot twists in both! 
similar themes 
I'm kind of surprised that people don't usually relate these two. They both have very similar art styles and soundtrack at first. They also both explore a cute adorable romance with an InTeReStInG twist (although the way they handle things from that point on is very different). Pancreas Movie is a bit more edgy, but not too much. They are very different experiences but have enough similarities that if you enjoyed the masterpiece that is Your Name, you will likely enjoy the almost-masterpiece that is Pancreas Movie. 
A story that is just as beautiful and even more compelling characters. If you watched Kimi no Na wa, and it was something you enjoyed, then Kimi no Suizou wo Tabetai is the perfect movie to follow up. Drama, romance, a beautiful soundtrack, plot twists, it's all here waiting for you. 
Although the animation is far superior in ""Your Name,"" ""I Want to Eat Your Pancreas"" creates an amazing story about two individuals who learn from each other and grow together. The latter has more of a romantic approach, however, ""love"" simply cannot describe the relationship between our two main characters. Both are great and truly worth the watch! (Also the first anime that ever made me cry as I'm not the most emotional person)   "
32281,23273,8,"Deeply moving, beautiful music. Both highlight the inner struggle and the influence of other people in understanding this struggle.  
Fabulous OST first of all, but these are deserving of their high ratings. Both have a story that is very strong and interesting to follow, and by rewatching these you can see new things that you hadn't the first time. Both story's are incredibly well told with twists and turns, but the entire thing is covered in foreshadowing. Along with beautiful art style, I am really glad that they both receive credit for all of the amazing attributes of these anime 
Premise wise and all, not similar at all. They feature personal connections and love as driving plot points in common, but that would be about it.What you're looking to watch Kimi no Na wa for after this is for that same GUT WRENCHING, POWERFUL, feels moment. In everything I've watched (which to some salted veterans of this site is very little but I digress) nothing has hit that emotional roller coaster ride quite like these two experiences.Don't do them back to back. You won't cope. 
although the story is completey different, but the way they apply the realistic feeling of human are the same and u could feel how the character was feeling. And also after finishing kimi no na wa/ shigatsuwa kimi no uso, will have the same feeling, the emotions keep roling in your head and heart.  
Both stories can tap into the feels of their audience like no one else by utilizing their art and background music to develop a an emotionally charged atmosphere. 
Both have amazing music and animation. Both of these anime are quite sad and might  make you cry. 
Are you longing for the bittersweet, sad feeling you got from Kimi no Na wa? Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso is a marathon of sadness compared to Kimi no Na wa's more perfectly tuned length. Their plots are quite different, but both are set around teenagers and their personal relationships. As a emotional fix, this is the perfect followup to Kimi no Na wa. 
Both Your Lie in April and Your Name have ""your"" in the title. Both of these titles follow mainly a male protagonist with a female supporting. These titles are easily able to pull tears out of you and keep you intrigued the entire way through. "
32281,9253,6,"Are you ready for more timeline shenanigans? Steins;Gate is a more mature series than Kimi no Na wa, but both feature organic relationships between characters - both romantic and platonic - as well as a deceptively pleasant start. 
Both has mind-blowing story full with twists and turns, comedy, and also tear-jerking. And both end with bittersweet feeling that makes you want more.  
This a romantic story where the characters switch bodies and there is time travel. It is an excellent movie. You will never forget! 
Both are time travel anime with elements of romance that transcend time. 
Steins;Gate is a 24 episode series while Kimi no Na wa is a movie, and so the common plot point of time travel is fleshed out a lot more in Steins;Gate.However, it is the relationships between the main characters across both titles that create the strong emotions that keep people coming back to these two titles.  
Steins Gate and Your Name both mainly rely on the feeling of ""longing"" the kind you feel after a particularly good dream or about the one person that ""got away"" to build tension and maximize emotional pay off.They also both start slow to capture the audience's imagination and allow time for us to attach ourselves to the small cast within the storyMakoto Shinkai's thematic exploration of ""distance"" and the romantic conflict that comes from distance shows up prominently in Steins Gate as well to build HIGH drama and lets just say Steins Gate isn't one of the highest rated anime out there for nothingand yes trains do show up to serve as a metaphor for separation as well hella worth checking out read more "
32281,7311,5,"Both are phenomenal movies that handle a beautiful romance that explores the themes of loss as well as stretches the bonds of a relationship through time and space. Haruhi is a bit more introspective and downtrodden, while Kimi no Na wa is a more upbeat movie. 
Finding and bringing back the one mc loves... also includes lost memory, supernatural, time travel, etc.  
Both movies are masterfully directed and gain high marks in all aspects that a viewer would use to critically watch film. 
- Both are about disappearance - Both invoke warm feelings- Both are easy-to-watch 
As a romance story, i think its pretty same for me. And the plan to the time leap idea from the story really made this two movie seems so simmilar. I just always remembering all of this two same movie with slightly concept on everyday at my life.  "
32281,33352,5,"Both Violet Evergarden and  Kimi no Na wa featured realistic art and emotional scenes. 
Beautiful art.Like Shinkai's works, Violet Evergarden also has hyper-realistic animation, beautiful attention to detail, and the lighting is just gorgeous. Although their plots and views are different, they share the same emotional, tear-jerking, yet heartwarming style of storytelling that leaves the viewer satisfied yet yearning for more. 
If you're looking for great backgrounds, a nice soundtrack, fantastic animation and a moving story, this is your way to go. While Violet Evergarden and Kimi no Na wa. have rather different scenarios, they're equally well made, and definitely are two anime you will remember. 
Beautiful visuals and music 
Wholesome Romance Drama "
32281,12355,5,"-Same Story telling styles-Amazing Soundtracks-Gorgeous animation-Emotional Stories 
Easily two of the most heartfelt stories to be released in the past decade. With honest characterization and light fantasy/sci-fi elements, these stories are able to tell extremely deep, memorable, and emotional experiences that few other films can rival.  
Maybe time can separate people. Maybe backgrounds can separate people. For a few that is the case. For Your Name and Wolf Children, that is not the case. Even with the differences in where people come from, or the literal boundaries time has on us. Both stories go to show that even these circumstances can be defeated.Your Name is the odd relationship of Mitsuha and Taki as they go through inescapable body switches, and how that draws them together. Wolf Children is about Hana’s relationship with the anomalies of literal Wolf Children.Both are great movies with amazing visuals, and elements of supernatural in both of them read more 
Stunning in visuals, story line and overall production value, if you enjoyed Your Name, you'll love Wolf Children. Each film tells a beautiful story, with great aesthetic and design value along with it.

the animatic, the mood, and the way the anime brings us into their world, especially with how the characters are connected by the 'red thread'. 
Even with differences, nothing changes. The stories Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms and Your Name both follow protagonists with different lifestyles and far apart who try and come together understanding one another.Promised Flower is building a family bond between an Iorph and human, whereas Your Name is about a relationship of a city boy and country girl.Both are great visual masterpieces with one made by Makoto Shinkai, the other Mari Okada, someone Shinkai actually acknowledges quite well. "
32281,38329,4,"If you looking for some supernatural mixed with some romance stuff, then kimi no nawa might be a good recommendation for aobuta movie, the storyline was stunning that'll surprise you. Romance giving it some sweetness along the way. 
-Both of these movies involve the use of time-travel, so as to change a certain outcome in the protagonist's relative present-They share the same 'Romance' tag, and rightfully so. All my fellow romance lovers out there will enjoy the levels in both(Do note though, that you'll need to have watched the original TV series for 'AoButa' for the movie to make any sense whatsoever) 
- Similar style.- Almost same genres.- Both movies are very emotional. 
Similar story progression. Remember what made Kimi no Na wa interesting when you watched it. An above-average anime that evolves into a masterpiece, right? Bunny Girl's series was the above-average anime part. This movie, the sequel of Bunny Girl is the masterpiece part.Other than that, things are similar genre-wise. You'll probably think of both in a similar way. "

Both anime masterfully direct scenes that are emotionally charged which end up making memorable moments for the viewer.   
Both stories have a male protagonist wanting to change the present using time travel and modifying the past.Both have several emotional scenes that connect with the viewer, trapping mostly people with similar experiences.Both just dig the necessary in the characters, avoiding fillers.Both are enjoyable, play with your feelings and emotions while developing the story but at the end you don't get a deep message or learning.The OP of both share a similar technique and have a hidden purpose (not saying more, find it by yourself) 
For a sentient and sensitive human being. For those who love time travels and/or parallel universes crossing. For those who like real life superheroes. For fools who believe in destiny. "
32281,34240,3,"One day, destinies of two people changed. But not pessimism. It's way for walk to the bright future.Both have amazingly beautiful art, very nice songs, stalwart characters. Fantastic and gorgeous.Mitsuha and Rin are so adorable girls in every way. They're positive and likable. And part of symbols.They get involved unknown worlds by a certain events. Full of alienation. Especially Rin. However, they never give up.Shelter only six minutes though, little similar to Kimi no Na wa. in terms of story. You can know if you listened both songs.Because meaning of their songs are very deep. Shelter tends to it. As you can see, Shelter is AMV which made by Official staff.Kimi no Na wa. has more detailed story. Aside from whether it's good or mediocre, I think plot of this movie is decent except some flaws.On the other hand, Shelter storytelling seems abstract, actually have a point IMO. This AMV has essence as same as Kimi no Na wa.As a result, both works are really emotional and thought-provoking about human nature. In a word, reasonable.You'll love Shelter if you're a big fan of Kimi no Na wa. or Makoto Shinkai. After watched this AMV, you'll feel happy for someone. read more 
Both are greatly emotional and beautiful anime. Both have some kind of astronomical disasters in them. Both have great music. One is a music video one is a movie. 
Both have fantastic soundtrack and beautiful backgrounds, visual effects. Both are related to some kinds of 'dream'. Both are stories related to comets (or asteroid). and a man tries to save the woman he loves. "
32281,37450,3,"The first 3 episodes of Bunny Girl Senpai is simply an upgrade to your name; both series are about supernatural phenomenons as well as losing memory and forgetting about someone you love.

After watching episode one of Bunny Girl, the ""Adolescence Syndrome"" reminded me of Your Name. "
32281,9989,3,"Ano Hana isn't about body-swapping like Kimi no Na wa. But what significantly makes them similar is the way the shows are extremely emotional. They both shock us with sad twists. The two shows also have similar background musics that trigger your sense of sympathy. They both also deal with superstitions involved around the main female characters. If you want to cry again, I'd strongly recommend this anime.(Plus, they have the same character designer). 
Similar premise. Similar art style and story telling. 
This movie made me feel like watching anohana and angel beats, these 3 animes can make anyone cry. "
32281,10408,2,"Both are movies that describe the relationship between the boy and girl. They both have more bittersweet endings and have great storylines, and art.

32281,4181,2,"The artstyle are very similar with the surrealistic drawings that draws you into the scene; very detailed. The stories deal with a normal world and another vaguely explained world. The way everything works is not put in front of you and requires you to activate your brain and think things through; maybe even doing research. The stories are very powerful and both activate emotions very easily. The biggest difference is how Clannad takes the emotions very far and toys with your heart, while Kimi no na Wa takes simple steps to trigger a lesser level of sadness. 
- Tragic events with the main characters lead them both to end up changing their fates- Both are emotionally powerful "
2904,1535,46,"If your a Code Geass fan you should love Death Note as I feel they are both similar character wise. In both, the main character gets a power to assist them in changing the world for the better in their views from a party whom follows them for the duration of the series. While doing so, they both gain followers who support their ideals. While this happens, a force attempt to fight the main character and discover their true identity.Both resemble a game of chess as the main character fights to knock out all obsticles in their way to have their ideas reality. 
Psychological, intelligent, smart leads. The leads are anti-heroes while the antagonists are heroic villains (or whatever you call a villain that's acts good). Both leads want to change the world and manipulates other people. The person who gives the power follows the current user. The anime makes you predict what's going to happen, and something unexpected happens (except for VERY few cases). The user also goes insane because of overusing their given power. 
Those anime are pretty similar and different at the same time. The main caracters are both very smart and have a incredible dream. They will receive a special power and manipulate people to get what they want. They evolve in two different environnement but both will do everything that is possible to realise their projects. 
In both Code Geass and Death Note, an incredibly intelligent teenage boy seeks to change the world with a secret, hidden, absolute power that very few know about. They differ in that Code Geass is much funnier while Death Note is much more serious, and that Lelouch uses his power for good, while Light is generally more selfish, especially towards the end. If you like Death Note, you'll DEFINITELY like Code Geass, but the same is not necessarily true in reverse. I personally prefer Code Geass by a lot, but both are awesome. I watched both series in dubs. 
Both animes have a highly intelligent main character who is trying to control humanity, though not for the reasons you might think. They could be described as righteous by one person, and evil by another...both would be right. How you view the main characters morals  and relationships makes watching these series an epic experience! 
Just like the second half of Death Note, season 2 of Code Geass has everything finally come together. Lelouch and Kira have been using their power for their ultimate goals, and it all comes together in the end. The finale of Code Geass is mind blowing and you will be left in awe similar to the finale of Death Note. 
The main reason why Code Geass and Death Note are compared so often is Light's uncanny resemblance to Geass's Lelouch. Both gain an ability by accident(or by fate if you want to call it that) that can change the world. Both are very intelligent, witted, manipulative, and have a twisted sense of justice that they attempt to justify. The main difference is that Code Geass has mechs and is a bit more colorful while in Death Note, Light is a bit more clever and emotional.(The cleverness factor is up for debate, as many people will argue that Lelouch is more clever than Light)  Another important key difference is that while Light is a more overall emotional character, he has almost no emotional attachment whatsoever to any other human.(His father was minimal and ultimately just a pawn in his game) Lelouch, is just as manipulative as Light, but does show a bit more of a charasmatic nature and his unconditional love towards his sister in the beginning of the show illustrates that perfectly.Another bonus of Code Geass is that it's ending and second season is MUCH better and well done then Death Note's. Overall, If you like Death Note, then you are almost SURE to enjoy Code Geass. Geass has a bit more humor and action, may not be AS psychological, but it's pretty damn close. read more 
Both have similar characters, psychological duels between characters and a supernatural weapon that changes the evolution of characters.(Geass - Death Note)Both evolves to the point that the hole world is involved in the main character actions. 
Both anime shows are about a young teenage genius with a mysterious power given to them by a supernatural being, which they both aim to change the world with.In both cases, the protagonists lose their memories at one point, have a beloved sister who gets in danger, goes up against their father.A notable difference is that Code Geass has giant fighting robots and machines, with strategy through battles and war, while Death Note has detectives and agents, with strategy through deception and guesswork. I'd recommend both though. 
Both animes are quite awesome. There are a guy who is very intelligent and thinks carefully about every move which he makes to achieve something. There are supernatural powers and both animes includes death. 
The protagonist (Main) characters are students-Before they were both given powers, they didn't care for the world-They both to want to make the world a better place even if it means killing others-They have a somewhat a benefactor that follows them-They're both weak, incredibly smart and stragetic-They're both exposed to public with fakes namesBoth constantly have the same similar events in the story that happen in both of these animes, Just one anime is mecha and the other is more like modern day life, but are both highly similar.  
They both have a highly intellegent main character given a special gift/power that is used to change the world. Both main characters have a huge ambition.  
both animes are d fight of brains which makes u glued to ur seat..well in code geass its mecha, and in death note its shinigami(death god)..both are epic series. 
They have similar lead characters (Light Yagami, L and Lelouch) who are intelligent. They both involve mindgames between adversaries. They are both excellently well-scripted anime with a mind-boggling element of slow revelation of plot. 
Both main characters have very similar personalities; they tend to be more villains than heroes. 
The story of two prodigies who could have led a normal life if they had not stumbled upon powers beyond human expectancy. Light Yagami at one side is dedicated to dominate the whole world while Lelouch Lamperouge strives for world peace in his own ways. They have their own set of rules and ideals which they follow. 
Both of them are full of drama, both of the shows are about protecting something (Death note: the main character tries to protect justice and Code Geass: the main character tries to protect his sister) and the most crusial similarity in my opinion is that both of the shows are full of strategy and sometimes mind games. The ending of both shows is similar as well. 
Both series revolve around a main character who wants to make the world we live in a better place. They both achieve a certain 'power' that helps them to achieve this goal. The battles in both series are based on deep tactical planning. The main character is borderline crazy and will do anything to achieve his life long goal. They will have you drop your jaw at how smart they are and surprise you every episode. 
>Both anime have an insane main character, I mean both Lelouch and Light are badass who want to ""control"" the world, even tho they aren't villans they both use illegal ways to get to their goal.>Both Lelouch and Light are geniuses, they are stronger in tactics then in fights and both of them are physically weak.>Death Note have a more dark atmosphere, Code Geass is more a lightful atmosphere.>Overall I enjoyed much more Code Geass, it has much more action, the ending is much more satisfying (I mean, I enjoyed DN only till episode 30 if I remember right, last 6-7 episodes are trash).  
The main characters are more or less the same. Genius, handsome, perfect bishounen (though Lelouch is not athletic). They want to create an ideal world after gaining a special power (death note/geass) using a cruel way. They manipulate countless people and fight using their high intelligent. Other's lives doesn't really matter for them.Differences: Light is more serious, selfish and more prioritizing his live. He doesn't really care about his comrades, even the closest one. Lelouch still care about their comrades. Code Geass still has some jokes and love. Despite not as serious, Code Geass has a really serious, epic ending, doesn't even compared to Death Note. Nevertheless, Death Note ending is also epic.If you love one, you will love the other read more 
-Both series have a young main male protagonist who wants to change the world using extreme methods (despite being on the opposite end of the spectrum)-Both series explore the theme of freedom-Both series have a main protagonist who has a special power (Light's being the Death Note while Lelouch's being Geass)-Both series have protagonists who's methods are questionable and could often be debated if they are right or wrong-Both series have some crazy plot-twists 
The plot twists are full of surprise and the suspense makes you want to watch the next episode as quickly as possible. 
Both of these are deal with Badass MC (Lelouch from Code Geass and Light from Death Note) with their way to create a peaceful world despite taking the wrong way and both MC have the power to facilitate their plans (Lelouch with his Geass and Light with his Death Note) and at the anime also have little bit Romance and a lot of Mystery. 
The characters in these series are both similar, and have similar goals. Lelouch wants to achieve world peace by creating the Black Knights and fighting back against Brittania, while in Death Note, Light uses the Death Note to rid the world of villains. They both used their own method of delivering justice. In both these series the main characters are portrayed as cruel, yet are fighting for good. Both series have lots of deaths. Also, Light and Lelouch are both geniuses.  
If you like anime where the characters are outsmarting their opponents to win a ""battle"" than these both anime are important to watch.The characters in both anime hate the world, they use powers to change the world and to make a better one.  
Both are very focused on strategies. The main character seems to be evil and his “rival” is in the justice/lawful side. 
Both anime have a strong leading character who wants to bring justice to this world.Both characters are genuineness at manipulating there surrounding and both have an adviser who gave them the power to change the world.   
Both of these psychological thrillers focus on individuals trying to change the corrupted and evil world they highly detest for some certain reasons. Given powers that are highly rare for normal humans by an ally, the protagonists welcome a dangerous and spine-chilling as well as addicting and mesmerising battle of complicated minds and powers which are sure to bring disasters. With a steady flow in their pace, these anime beautifully present the depth of emotions such as love and hatred, how war can obliterate even the strongest of friendships and the strength of human ambitions. Both of these breath-stopping animes have moments which can make you shed tears or laugh out loud, moments which capture your heart and make you get lost in them. Both of them are sheer perfection. read more 
Similar characters with a cold, dark air about them. They both put up facades to how they truly feel and act, both kill in extraordinary ways, and have a special ability, and a female partner.similar feel to the anime (if you truly watch anime you know what I mean) 
Because, this anime has a main character (Lelouch) unique and almost the same as the main character anime death note (Light). berceritakan about a young boy who wants to change the world, but in a different way. Lelouch wants to change the world a better place simply for the sake of her sister (Nunnaly). This anime is interesting to watch because it presents something different from other anime. 
Similar plot line where Protagonists are tired of the way their world works and by the end of first episode they get the power they need to change it.Similar mastermind ""enemies"" to protagonists which try to take them down. 
Light finds a way to kill by a notebook from a death god, Lelouch receives the power of the geass to order anything to anyone and seek a better world to his beloved sister, incapable of walk and see. Brutal stories, with worlds that seems to doesn't have a way to get peace. Both protagonists had an objective for fulfill, their personalities makes you tremble during all the show, insanity, depression, desires, playing a game with your ideals and moralities (Is he insane? Is he doing it for a better world? what's right, what's wrong?). They are masterminds of strategy, playing fool with everyone! A special power can change their lives and achieve what they couldn't until then.  I recommend both of them! When you think that there's no way out, there they go with a back up plan! It's just amazing, it can surprise you until the end. Although Code geass answer all your questions along with the serie and will hurt your feelings with the dramatic end, death note makes you want to know what happen after the end, an obscure end that captures your mind.  read more 
Both have genius protagonists both give you a moral choice both don't have a clear cut good and bad both have a protagonist that has methods that many might not agree with both the 2 best Animes in my opinion!  
The similarity of these series is in the main character with a God complex and some supernatural power using which he's trying to conquer the world. Find out what happens to every worlds' conqueror yourself. 
This show gives off the same vibe watching Lelouch overcome obstacles as in Death Note with Light. Season 2 
Both anime focus on the what is true justice and how the main character uses 'evil' as one way to achieve it. They know how the world needs to be changed, and focus on the special power each has received to reach the new world. 
Yeah, if you've watched Code Geass and not Death Note, go watch it. They're known as brothers, even twins. Great, genius main character with magical powers can can kill people.  
The protagonist of code geass like light is really really smart and also receives a power that can change the world with the difference that he´s not perfect like Light that is excellent at everything and can make every plan he thinks to work. Unlike Light, Lelouch is weak at phychical activities and he´s plans often go wrong, sometimes really really wrong.The fact that Lelouch has all this fails gives you the change to relate better with him, also one diference that for me is very important is the way they deal with the people around them, Lelouch llike Light use people to his one benefict but he cares about lot of people and he carries all the sins he commits to himself unlike Light that just doesn´t care about anybody.Light has the death note and can kill people just by writing their name but has a lot of rules that he discover as the serie progresses. With Lelouch is the same thing he get´s the power named geass by a girl named c.c that for me is one of the best female caracters ever and with that power he can give any order he wants to the people he meets but with some limitations.So if you liked Death Note for sure you will like Code geass too, it has psycological conflits and interesting tactics, plot twists, more action than death note, a really carismatic and smart protaganist and all the philosofical conflicts that came with a relly bad ass power. read more 
In both animes the main character - an ordinary boy in the beginning - gets super-powers and decides to change the world by violent means and intelligent outsmarting. 
Both have protagonists that are brilliant and play mind games. There are certainly striking similarities. Note: Only recommend if you 1. Liked Lelouch 2. Liked the strategizing and foresight in Code Geass 
it is one of the best series i have ever seen . if you have watched R1 and like it then believe me this season is gonna blow your mind (especially the ending).  
Both feature a main character who is very intelligent seeking an ultimate goal with their new bestowed power. Good dramatic moments throughout both where the main character's intellect is the thing giving him the advantage. 
Like everyone who watched both show knowCode Geass and death note are similarBoth MC are similar both want to create a new and idool worldPeople want to stop them Mind game - twist and turn that's what both show are all About  
If you have watched death note or Evangellion i would definitely give this a watch. It has an amazing story and you would be missing out on a rollercoaster of a ride. The main characters in it have amazing backstory's and you get to have a great connection with some of them overall one of my favourite anime's and if this helped then make sure to give it a watch  
Both main characters of these shows have a similar feel . 
Its full of main character acting like he is not terrorist and they both have smart Mc's "
2904,1,3,"The strength of these shows lies in the charming and cool characteristics that the protagonist exudes. Spike from Cowboy Bebop is exhibits the chill and relaxed type of cool, while Lelouch from Code Geass shows more charisma and passion in his goals. Also, both shows have fights in different mode, such as gun fights, mecha fights (in CB, it's space ship), and clash of ideals. Both anime are praised for its epic ending, even from haters. Did I mention that both are made by Sunrise? 
Both have interesting and intelligent main characters with motives shrouded in mystery.Both clearly sci fi influenced with their space travel and mecha / machinery.Both series come to a conclusion in similar ways.Both have amazing soundtracks and characters. 
Unlike Bebop's average run, CG extends towards the 2nd season and once again proves caliber writing to meet Bebop's standards and surpass it in many expectations despite keeping an opinion that Bebop cannot be touched.They end with an epic style with a roller coaster of emotions and feels that hit you hard and at the same time you hate it with all of your guts.All I can say is that by giving Lelouch and Spike a run, their character development and plot is what will come to circle by the time the story ends.Props to Sunrise for creating an ultimate masterpiece of both shows from one decade to the next. read more "
2904,9253,3,"Both are very exciting anime, with lots of plot-twists, well-made and rich stories, great voice acting and lots of thrills.In Steins;Gate you get to see time-travel and all its effects on the human mind and its possibilities.While in Code Geass you see the ambition of a young man who gets the power to command anyone to do anything and manages to create an uprising against an empire (Britannia). 
Although Code Geass picks up immediately and it's engaging from the start, Steins; Gate manages to chill the viewer as you advance to the ending.  Some are relatively unaffected by the plot behind Steins Gate due to the resentment caused by some of the ""theories"", which are held to be true in the anime + they also abhor simplicity of the plot for those who are connoisseurs in the effects of altering not only the past but the future.  Nevertheless, I would think that many would enjoy how intricate the plot is - relative to most anime.  I especially enjoyed steins; gate due to its incorporation of the principle of how space-time is primarily affected by what you think, perhaps even an apparition.  The level at which the anime operates is similar to how Lelouch operates in its plots, albeit on a more profound level.  In no way am I saying that I honestly know what I'm talking about, but this is my first review, and I just wanted people who haven't started steins;gate yet to realize why it's regarded as such a good anime. read more 
Both mess with your mind and have amazing plot twists. Definitely recommend both. "
2904,30,2,"both are roller coaster ride of emotion and drama  
Like many mechas and a lot of anime shows in general, there is that influence from the classic Neon Genesis Evangelion. Despite both being mechas, the actual mechas and fights in both series are very different. Instead, NGE's influence, without getting into any spoiler, can be seen with the Ragnarok concept (which in my opinion seemed like something right out of NGE). Other than that, the story, protagonists, feel, and animation are nothing alike. "
2904,2001,2,"Both are mecha animes with very intense epic battles, the story plot between the two are both similar in a way to how they both want to make the world a better place and to become successfull in doing so. Theres quite a bit of mecha action and dramatic suspense with romance here and there, with some comedy to lighten up the moods. Very good animes overall.  
These anime are both really over the top mecha and to be fully appreciated require the viewer's suspension of disbelief. Highly enjoyable and compelling.  "
2904,5114,2,"Both deal with someone with a specific view of the World trying to change it. Both have fantastic elements to it (alchemy in Fullmetal and ""magic""/mechas in Code Geass) that adds a certain mood to the series. Both are very dramatics stories with lots of twists, but not without their comedic moments. Both are great shows, that will make you think, laugh and perhaps even cry. 
Both have conspiracy by the governers and supernatural aspect. They are about same length as a series. They both are non-filer and doesn't contain unnecessary scenes in order to keep story fluesnt. Action scenes are similarly attractive as FMA:B combat's are based on alchemy and Code Gaeass combat's are mecha echol but not your typical lame fight scenes "
2904,820,2,"They're both about ambitious, tactical geniuses, although LotGH is a much more grounded & believable series imo. 
Legend of the Galactic Heroes or Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu is the more mature version of Code Geass. You will find a mass of Lelouch-like characters. The story is better written - means that they are not so much plotholes. You won't find so stupid ideology in this OVA-series. "

199,431,25," Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle are visually stunning experiences with a strong surreal underpinning behind coming of age narratives. In both movies a magical world unfolds before bewildered young heroines who must claim a new position within apparent chaos. Spirited Away is more hectic and upbeat while Howl's focus on darker themes such as war and violence. Yet both invoke the same spirit of beautiful natural scenes rendered sublime by Miyazaki's unique style.  
A mystical and enchanted storyline of romance permeates both of these wonderful creations by the same director 
This two great movies have the same creator and they both contain great stories about curse, love, and drama at the same time. If you'll notice upon watching them, the way they were drawn was also the same. In characters Haku(Spirited away) and Howl(HMC) do look alike. Both movies have great lessons and that after you watch them they will surely leave a good memory. 
As you all likely know already, both Howl's Moving Castle and Spirited Away are the brainchild of Hayao Miyazaki; however, the two films share numerous similarities in addition to Studio Ghibli and Miyazaki's style.Perhaps the greatest overbearing theme in both movies is the use of surreality bordering upon absurdism. Miyazaki is a master of this style. His movies are filled with surreal and inventive worlds and magical, unique characters. More so than any of his other films, Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle invoke the same feeling of wonder to their majestic settings.As far as the narrative goes, both movies are centered two young and bewildered coming of age heroins and their sojourns through the new and fantastic worlds they are discovering. Along the way, love, compassion, curiosity and development are evident in each of the protagonists. Miyazaki's protagonists are quite akin to Alice from Lewis Carrol's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, featuring young female leads as they journey through newly discovered mystical worlds.Although Howl's Moving Castle contains a slightly darker theme with a violent war ravaging the world and Spirited Away has a lighter and more upbeat feel, both are excellent films laden heavy with Miyazaki's beautiful and sublime visions coupled with a mystical, romantic adventure. read more 
Besides that both are made from Hayao Miyazaki, they both represent pure love and friendship. Spirited Away is about a girl, Chihiro, who depends on her friends to save her family from the magical world which they do not belong in and Howl's Moving Castle's, Sophie, relies on her friends, one of them supplies major eye candy, to release her from a curse. They both have happy endings and are films that are in my top ten favorite movies (Spirited Away is one of Roger Ebert's favorite movies) and they will definitely be yours too. 
Both have gorgeous art and they both dwell in fantasy and the supernatural. They also have the same producers so they have similar art styles. What's more, they both have fascinating plots and lovable characters. 
Same producers, Studio Ghibli. Both of the movies have a great story, same genre, romance, fantasy, supernatural, adventure and a very good drama. Both of movies are great and worth watching, has great lessons of love and friendship between the cast/characters of both of the movies.  
Like magic? Like inventive transportation? The creators of Spirited Away and the talented voices of Billy Crystal, Lauren Bacall, Christian Bale, Jean Simmons, and Emily Mortimer bring Howl's Moving Castle to life. See a world where wizards and witches fight in a war and curses are cast on the innocent so nothing and no one is quite what it seems. 
The plots are different but both have a girl as the protagonist as they accidently get involved in another world full of magical elements and fantasy.  
Two different movies and both made by Hayao Miyazki. Both movies are highly creative, involve magical elements, very light underlying romance between the two characters and are both about a young girl who is leading an average life until suddenly being whisked away into a magical/spiritual adevnture.  
Both were made by the same director and producer. Both are about a relationship between a human girl and an unusual guy. Both are fantasy, and the character's main goal is the same: remove the curse. 
Sophie & Chihiro sound like they're both dreaming aren't they? They think they're dreaming and both are very dark anime. But actually it was really half-real and half-fantasy 
Both are fantastical, dream-like, magical, captivating stories of Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli. 
These two movies are very similar. The ideas are almost like a copy of each other! One week after I had seen Spirited Away, I saw Howl's Moving Castle, and yet I was amazed by it! They made me realize what love truly means! 
For starters, they both are breathtaking movies from Studio Ghibli. The art and animation in both are so similar that the characters look a lot alike. The main protagonists (who are both girls) have a curse put onto them or their family, so they're sent on a journey to break that curse. Howl's Moving Castle and Spirited Away are adventurous, fantasy, and romance movies that will draw your interest in from start to finish. 
These two titles are excellent example of unique love stories. I mean, we have female protagonists whos adventures are the main plots of these titles. Chihiro and Sophie have to give up their normal lives. Consequently, they meet their beloveds who are really mysterious and powerful persons. And what it is worth mentioning is the fact that they are great titles for whole families. Every family's member will appreciate other thing and anyone won't be disappointed after them. They are the great start for people who think that anime is only ""Chinese porn cartoons for kids""... they are but not in this case. 
Obviously both have there similarities as they are both studio ghibli films. However these 2 in particular have a very simile feel.  
Both anime movies are produced by Studio Ghibli and directed by Hayao Miyazaki. They have similar animation and character design, as well as great landscapes and soundtracks by Joe Hisaishi. Both contain coming of age narratives, following a young heroine in a magical world filled with magic and spirits. In both anime, the protagonist have to find a way to break a spell. 
Studio ghibli flavour 
The two epic fantasy-ghibli movies. In my opinion Howl's the best.Perfect animations and draws, beatiful and detailed landscapes and unforgottable OST. Both in the same level, just the best combination of the franchise.The characters are charismatic and very unique; the stories are entertaining and interesting.I Think that Howl has better or deeper characters and the story is less complicated, but both are a must see if you like the anime and/or the movies. 
Both of these films are made from the well known Studio Ghibli - both of these films have the the weird but lovable story lines the studio is known for. They both have fantastic characters and the artwork is great!Similarities - 'Quirky' story line's with the intriguing characters. 
-Same Studio ""Ghibli""-Director, Script, Screenplay, Executive Producer by ""Miyazaki, Hayao""-Drama, Adventure-Sound by ""Hisaishi, Joe"" -Same Producer ""Suzuki, Toshio"" 
Both Miyazaki films will take you to a magical world. Both films are masterpieces in my mind that features (a) a beautiful fantasy world, (b) amazing character building - watch the characters grow and mature and learn about themselves as they embark on their adventure, and (c) a great story -- Both stories are wonderful deep adventures that will leave you craving to learn more about the world and the characters. I'm impressed by how much both movies are able to capture in under 2 hours. i watched spirited away when I was 10 years old and it's remained my favorite animated film throughout my childhood and well into my adult life. I watched howl's moving castle more recently, but it brought back similar emotions of curiosity and amazement as the story unraveled.  read more

both are about spirits, but Spirited away has more action, and Natsume Yuujinchou is more relaxing, :) 
both are full of loving characters you will never forget. while spirited away is more fast paced natsume yuujin is more slow and calm. Both are full of supernatural creatures and the determination of a child/teen to do what they think is right. fully fleshed out characters that are brought to life on the screen right before your eyes. if you liked spirited away you will love natsume yuujin because both are unforgettable in their own right.  
Both have a human become involved in a spirit community. 
Both are supernatural tales regarding interesting ghosts and their stories. Ghosts in both anime aren't the horrific killer ghosts, but just spirits that just want to live peacefully. 
If you love spirited away, I would really recommend watching this!Similar air/vibe about these two and the idea of spirits or youkai is present in both.Both really beautiful. 
If you're a fond of spirits, monsters, or any weird apparitions, but an anime that's got a great story, then Natsume Yuujinchou is for you. 
If you are seeking a Anime with Youkai & Spirits, look no further than Spirited away, and Natsume and the book of friends. Both anime have really good story telling, where Natsume Yuujinchou focus more on many different stories, Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi focuses on one longer one. Both anime are relaxing and some what exciting to watch. If you looking for a good time, or you just finished spirited away but long for some more of those spirit like beings? Check out Natsume Yuujinchou!I´m glad i did! 
Both Natsume and Spirited Away concern the relationships between humans and spirits; in Natsume, it is the relationship between him and the youkai apparently only he can see, in Spirited Away, it is the relationship between Sen and the spirits of the bath house. Due to it being a movie, Spirited Away has a much more prominent plot, whereas Natsume, being a slice of life show, is more laid back with episode-long story arcs. Both are fantastic.  "

Bakemono no Ko attempts to be a bit more 'grown-up', and has a story spanning a much longer period of time. 
Coming-of-age movies about a child happening upon another world. Both are delightfully evocative with consistent interest and tight animation. 
The alternate worlds in both movies give a similar surreal, dream-like feeling 
These films are extremely similar, child runs off and gets lost in a new world filled with weird beings. They both find someone that will guide them though it, teaching them the ways of life there. But eventually their goal is to return to the human world. Both these films are masterpieces a highly recommend both 
These films explore the boundary between the human and fantasy worlds. The protagonists are young children who mature through their experiences within the other world after receiving the help of magical creatures. The stories focus on family (whether it's adoptive or biological), unlikely friends, and personal growth through learning. The fantastical wonder in a child's mind as s/he sees the world - that's what these films will bring back to you, regardless of what age you are now. 
Similar stories about humans going to a world of monsters/spirts/beastsThey both have amazing animation. 
Both are about a young MC who gets lost in a alternative world and find a mentor to guide them. 
Starting out as a bratty kid who only thinks about themselves characters, Chihiro and Ren find themselves crossing a barrier between the norm and the supernatural, into a mystical world not like the one they are used to. Full of mythical humanoid characters, in a landscape where they are now the irregulars, the two embark on a tale of growing up.The Boy and The Beast are much more explicit with the theme of ""growing up"" so much that Ren, the protagonist, goes through a coming of age story. Spirited Away is much more implicit in that Chihiro learns from her time in the spirit world she gets a job in. Both tell a great tale of simply growing up and understanding that not everything will come your way, sometimes you need to work your way to the life you want to go accordingly. They both also get given new names upon arriving at the new world; ""Sen"" and ""Kyuta"" respectively.Both are great anime movies with Boy and Beast featuring good comedy as well as some action.

Everyone already spotted the similarities. Both movies have spirits, girl and boy protagonists, but it's shorter and sadder. 
Both have supernatural elements and are about when a human interacts with spirits. They also have slightly similar themes of romance. 
Both stories revolve around a helpless, innocent little girl as a protagonist, who then is aided through the challenges she faces by a mysterious boy. As you watch through the film, you will see the relationship develop slowly between the two characters.As said in the previous posts, yes they also have that same supernatural related genre, and they both will also have that bittersweet ending as well.  
Very warm and sweet. A young girl is involved in a ""true love"" relationship with a non-human which ends somewhat prematurely and moves on in life. The portrayal of love is meant for a younger audience. There is somewhat a bittersweet feeling at the end, but with the emotional development of the main character, you cannot help but to feel happy for them. 
A girl encounters spirits, which then revolves into a story about the spirits and the girl either growing up or realizing things about herself. Both movies also include a huge amount of japanese mythology.

Both were made by Studio Ghibli, and have girls as main characters . Both almost equal in length and are movies. They are both very good. I recommended checking both out. 
made by the same guy Hayao Miyazaki. He makes great anime movies that will leave you wanting more, I can't say that I didn't enjoy watching all of the movies that were made by him. His movies are very creative and original, if you've seen one, you should check out some of his others, they are all just as good. His movies are so great that I even re watched some of them a few times. anyways if you're interested in one of his movies, you're almost guaranteed to like the others. see for yourself.

Shinsekai yori has a *very* similar feel to Spirited Away, and Princess Mononoke. It very much has an epic feel that is just breathtaking and beautiful that is very similar to a Ghibli film. It is similar to Spirited Away, in that it is about the journey of children growing more mature, in a world of magical powers that they don't understand. With Princess Mononoke, it's a very similar setting, of a rural, medieval setting in Princess Mononoke, and a Post Apacolyptic/far future medieval setting in Shinsekai yori. Both have a very similar art style and epic feel, that impart deep messages.  
Both titles have a great focus on world-building.The first arc of Shinsekai Yori serves as a world-building arc and Spirited Away explores its universe through Hayao Miyazaki's imagination.

Same Director, pretty much the spiritual successor to Cowboy Bebop,completely different world/story, their main similarity is...the awesomeness of the music, other than that, it's totally different. 
Although set in opposing eras, both have a strong musical theme weaving through the engaging journey of a group of accidentally travellers (for Champloo) / bounty hunters (for Bebop). Both series may seem episodic but every one is highly enjoyable. Plus all the characters have fascinating deep/dark backstories.  
The same director is enough to put these series together, because Watanabe's way to create is somehow the same with Miyazaki, who share many ideas in his works. The crew contingent is almost the same, a woman and two men (with some exceptions). The story contingent is also almost the same, one episode - one story, with a great story line which has resolution in the end. You'll find moments to laugh yourself to death and to burst into tears. Besides all the above listed you'll enjoy an awesome work with music in these series. It isn't just a background for the main performance, but a very integral part of the creation. read more

same guy behind the direction and story (shinichiro watanabe) with the same idea of fusing a music culture with a genre ( retro hip-hop and rap + historical samurai setting = samuraichamploo,                                                                                                                         Jazz, blues and old rock + sci-fi space cowboys and bounty hunters = cowboy bebop ) read more 
Samurai Champloo is pretty much an inverted Cowboy Bebop. One's a futuristic show about the past, the other's a historical one about the future. They definitely seem like two parts of a whole to me. 
They're both made by Shinichiro Watanabe, and they both share his unique flare. Instead of Jazz in Space meets Western, though, Samurai Champloo is Feudal Japan (Edo Period, I believe) with hip-hop stylings. It makes for a very unique anime, and the characters are awesome. 
Champloo offers the same kind of artistically edgy depth as the masterpiece that is Bebop. While the two do not share similar story types nor art styles, i believe that there is a certain unspoken class of anime these two are filed under. We all i know how diverse anime can be in terms of art style as well as theme. Though i like to believe there was a resurgence in the popularity of anime in the West with animes in this class im talking about. In my opinion, this is where it truely got started folks. These animes turned a lot of us into the Otakus (geeks) we are today. Do not miss this amazing Series! You will not be disappointed friends. read more 
Same director~Basically a group of people that travel around place to place. There's a similar feel in atmosphere in both of these animes. Of course, Fighting Scenes are awesome! Although one has to do with samurais and the other is more futuristic. A bit of comedy as well :] 
Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo were both done by the same guy, and so both are based around music concepts. While Cowboy Bebop centers around the free-form of Jazz (Spike) versus ordered form (Jet), Samurai Champloo centers around hip-hop (Mugen) vs. classical music (Jin). 
They're by the same director and one incorporates hip-hop music and culture with samurai, while the other incorporates jazz with cowboys (well, space cowboys). Both are episodic with an overarching plot, and the main characters are somewhat similar. 
The two are mostly an episodic series with an interesting main story to tie it all together. Although different in atmosphere both have a good balance of humour and action. There are definite differences between the two but if you have watched Cowboy Bebop (or vice versa) you might notice the style reflects that of the director Shinichirō Watanabe. 
Both series are made from the same creators so if you liked the style and ""coolness"" of Bebop, you'll probably like the edgy and cool style of Champloo just as much. Plus the voice of Mugen is the same voice actor who did Spike, Steve Blum! 
Champloo is another gem from Shinichiro Watanabe, director of Bebop.  On the surface that's about the only thing that could be listed as similar.  Shinichiro Watanabe has a knack for juxtaposing two well tread ideas to create something completely new and interesting.  Bebop can be described as a futuristic, retro 70's, wild west, space cowboy story with a bit of noir sprinkled in for good measure;  Champloo can be described as a hip-hop samurai journey.  Even though they aren't similar they do compliment each other perfectly. 
Same director, same vision...  different setting.  Cowboy bebop is on some futuristic cowboy era bounty hunters with a jazz/blues undertone. Samurai Champloo is on some edo period samauri sword swingin drifters with that real hip hop finish. The character development progresses in the same ""bits and peices"" style. Spike from cowboy bebop has the same badass smooth tough guy tip as Mugen in Samurai Champloo. I give them both 9's in my animelist... check em out  
I'm not going to beat this into the ground. Both go hand in hand perfectly. Each similar in their own unique ways, musically and character wise. If you loved one your going to love the other. 
-Each episode has its own small story.-Major plot end ties up everything and wraps up the series.-Interesting cast of main characters, all having a generally vague backstory.-Side characters are very interesting as well.-Stylistic action with subtle humor mixed in (not mostly slapstick)-The characters act very similarly (Spike-Mugen, Jet-Jin, Faye-Fuu)-Both directed by Shinichiro Watanabe, which explains the similarities. 
The main characters, Spike and Mugen are very similar if not related. What I mean by similar might come out strange for some but I believe it'll present itself after more study. The voice actor is the same and the same people worked on both. Both fun to watch and I suggest watching both. 
Aside from the fact that they were both directed by Shinichiro Watanabe, the two are chaotically fun cultural mishmashes with amazing art, music, and fight scenes. (Of course, Bebop has a lot more substance...)  
Both are great cultural mashups that involve completely different music styles from the era presented and yet work wonders.Cowboy Bebop takes western culture, space travel and jazz and blends them perfectly creating quite the energising experience.Samurai Champloo takes the Edo period and hip-hop and surprisingly it works, especially due to the amazing soundtrack.A key features that is seen in both is the pacing. Both are episodical but not to an extremei. They take different routes and breaks but still you feel like they're getting closer to the main path thanks to the way above average character development. The soundtrack is amazing for both series, mainly due to the fact that even if they're utilizing one style they can freely add elements from the time periods they're refering to.Both are must watch shows and leave quite the impression. read more 
They have different themes, but both are animes very attached to their soundtracks. Love themes are present, but it is ambiguous, leaving a lot of interpretations to the audience. 
They are both directed by Shinchiro Watanabe. They are built on a similar premise: Cowboy Bebop is space bounty hunters set to a mostly jazz soundtrack while Samurai Champloo is samurai set to a hip-hop soundtrack.  
Samurai Champloo's main character is as skilled as Spike and both have afros. The same director created both shows. Cowboy Bebop is a show that mixed the future with past whereas Samurai Champloo mixes the past with the future. 
Both groups are in search of something, and in the process, they live day by day trying to find food and money to get by.Excluding Ed (regretfully), the characters are pretty similar. Spike=Mugen, Jet=Jin, Fey=Fuu, and (kind of, in the sense that they are both supporting animals) Ein=Momo.Both groups don't start out being great friends and all, but as time and adventures go by, they end up warming up to each other which makes it hard for them to go their own ways.  
There are other great recommendations on these anime, so i just want to talk about their great use of music.Although they have different styles of music, both are very music centric, using it to mould the scenes and give a great sense atmosphere. Both are rightly praised on their music and they are used in similar ways which are accompanied by familiar settings. You will own both soundtracks before you know it.  
- same Director, Shinichiro Watanabe- episodic format. The characters set on an adventure and encounter lots of side characters that take part on each main character's development and back story.- badass male MC.- both have anachronistic setting. - both have nice music. Cowboy Bebop is jazz, while Samurai Champloo is hip-hop. Both OPs are also great! 
Both are directed by Shinichiro Watanabe, follow the misadventures of a small group in an episodic format, have superb music which creates a unique style, and often deal with philosophical issues in their conflicts. Both brilliant! 
Both have similar characters, good music, one episode - one story (at most two episodes), a good plot, and describe life situations and problems in different worlds. They have similar humor and don't hide violence and blood. 
Both done by same people and have similar art styles . Main characters are very similar in a certain way; both of them also very Era/Culture-influenced . 
Mugen and Spike. Two of the most badass, laid-back and expressions of cool for any character in anime. Whilst both stories surrounding the characters are not similar, the struggles and fights of both these said characters offer entertainment and the same vibe to interest you, if these characters are to your liking. 
Music influences both series in different ways and the characters are unique and really make the anime amazing 
Same director. Where Bebop combines a sci-fi setting with a jazzy, western vibe, Champloo combines a Japanese samurai setting with a hip-hop vibe. Both animes are also relatively episodic rather than serial.  
One trait that sets Shinichiro Watanabe’s work apart is his refusal to accept this Japanese conformity. In his anime, all of the characters define themselves by their individuality, fighting for themselves and ONLY themselves in a vast and lonely world. In Cowboy Bebop, the characters were thrown together by chance and stayed together only as long as convenience allowed. Although the anime was for the most part an action comedy, even the hilarious moments were subdued by this profoundly forlorn undercurrent of internal solitude.Samurai Champloo has a very similar feel; in the series, three misfits who would otherwise have nothing to do with each other are thrown together by coincidental events. The characters then proceed to engage in a variety of episodic escapades, finally culminating in a suitably climactic and suspenseful conclusion. This basic plot structure, combined with Watanabe’s trademark freeform style, makes it easy to draw comparisons between the two works, despite the radically different settings.In any case, if you liked one, watching the other is practically a matter of course. read more 
Both series have the same director, focus on a small cast of characters, and episodic adventures with enjoyable action. While Bebop has more experimentation with film noir and exploring the characters themselves, Champloo is more about the adventures the characters partake in.I will say that it's not on the same level of quality as Bebop and suffers from things Bebop never did, but it does have it share of pros like the animation and action (which is obviously based on sword fighting, giving the anime its own sense of identity).   
Both Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo are written by the same author and feature the same episodic nature. Additionally, the three main protagonists of each respective series are of the same archetypes. If you enjoyed Bebop, you'll likely enjoy Champloo. 
The focus of both series is the mix of different styles especially music: Cowboy Bebop is a mix of cowboy western, film noir, Jazz and Blues setting in space. Samurai Champloo is a mix of samurais, modern-day Japan and hip hop setting in Edo-era Japan. Also both series have an episodic storytelling with an overall story. Another important and common aspect is the journey into the main character's past. 
These two anime have an extremely similar vibe. They share many of the same production crew so it is no surprise that stylistically and aesthetically are in many ways comparable. There is a similar character dynamic in Samurai Champloo as in Bebop, but what makes me think you will enjoy this anime is actually how the two shows are different. Many of the plot choice in Samurai Champloo seem to be parallel to the choices in Bebop; however, in Samurai Champloo, many of the subtle issues that were passed over lightly in Bebop are explored in greater depth. These two shows are in no way related to one another, but they are both stylistic masterpieces IMHO. TL;DR: If you like Bebop you will find more of what you love in Samurai Champloo read more 
Two absolutely brilliant anime with incredible characters.No significant plot in either anime because the characters take the spotlight and the interactions between characters are amazing.Wicked, smooth fight scenes, great dialogue and absolutely awesome characters.Both anime are memorable for, did i mention, the characters?On a serious note, amazing, character-driven anime. Period. 
Made by the same guy. Both have a group of protagnists who travel for a single goal while encountering random misadventures along the way. Both have amazing art, action, characters, soundtrack and unique during its time.  
The principal idea of my recommendation is based on different factors. First of all we got an awesome opening, the kind of stuff you can download an put on your mp3 to listening on daily routine. Second, even if the story happens in different timelines (Space, 2071 for Cowboy Bebop and Japan, Edo Period for Samurai Champloo), we can see a presente of a ""road trip"" in both, with all the crew together and helping each other. Different plots, where you have a new adventure in each episode. Same kind of comedy and some resemblance between main characters. 
Same style , Same Genres , Same Pattern of events , and both Depends on the course of events more than story , and both have their own music themes , same type of characters 
This recommendation is based on the English dub. Same director, same main character voice actor (Mugen and Spike). Both of these characters are interesting and badass to say the least. Group dynamic is even the same within the main cast; two guys who are skilled at their roles then an annoying female character who brings more trouble than fortune. The 2 male main characters make up for this however.Both anime are episodic; although Cowboy Bebop has the better overarching plot from the get-go. Both are enjoyable nonetheless. 
While Cowboy Bebop often accrues more glory, both of these shows are made by the same directors, and, personally, I enjoyed Champloo more. The main characters are all very similar, and both series maintain an episodic style up until the last few dramatic episodes, which are both fantastic in their own ways. 
Samurai Champloo and Cowboy Bebop. They present us to the trio, who join, for the same purpose. Mini-histories appear before them, where they must contribute a grain of sand to get money and food, although things always get complicated. We have the boy who only thinks of struggling to get what he wants, sometimes without caring about anyone else's life. The type who prefers not to get involved, if not necessary. The girl can sometimes be a nuisance, subject to looks, but she can be cunning. Two series full of action and comedy along with different events, where they talk about different topics of interest, where they always end up involved. read more 
Both are made by the same director.Both have a big influence with music ( OST are awesome !) and are really similar in many points 
Both are long action packed adventures that end with an expected and ideal ending.  Both have similar art style and both have a heavy influence on the music that is present in the anime. 
These two anime share the same episodic narrative (they're both directed by Watanabe Shinichiro), have very unique and iconic characters and are highly influenced by a specific music genre in their epic soundtracks and overall style, although Samurai Champloo feels more ""wacky"" in a -indeed- positive way. The two series have some epic fight directing/coreographing, and as much as the settings are very different, both of these two great must-watch shows will feel very similar inspite of their unique characteristics, which will just add value to their overall quality. 
Just finished watching Samurai Champloo after having no prior knowledge of its existence, and wow. If you like great character and world development with an interesting story and great beats, then boy have i got the anime recommendation for you. Now i recommend both to anyone reading this. but if you have seen one of the anime and enjoyed it, i guarantee you will find something in the other worth your time.""I hope that the rain will never stop. If it continues, then I can stay here forever."" 
Same director, and the style of story telling is the same. They both have an overarching story, but most episodes don't really matter in terms of the whole plot itself. 
Two offerings from Watanabe, and both are definitely worth watching. The stories  and characters are similar - the spirited and determined female character, the rebellious young man that doesn't obey society's rules, and that man's quieter and more reserved counterpart, each journeying together across space/Japan, searching for something. Whereas Cowboy Bebop has a jazz + space combination, Samurai Champloo has a hip-hop + ancient Japan combination, one that might sound strange, but the two work together to create an interesting world, with plenty of humorous moments.  
-Action, adventure and comedy packed anime with great plots -Similarities between characters and their relationships (i.e. Spike/Mugen, Faye/Fuu)-Badass characters-Phenomenal fighting scenes and martial arts -Both anime have different but unique settings and timelines (futuristic but retro space western style for one and alternate japanese edo style for another)-Music and OST have a big influence in both anime and are what make them stand out (jazz and blues for cowboy bebop and J hip-hop for samurai champloo)-Both anime share the same director, Shinichirou Watanabe-As much as cowboy bebop is known to be a classic and a must watch anime, I'd say so is samurai champloo despite being on the underrated side (so I highly recommend watching it!!) read more 
Both series have the same director and have an episodic formula. Furthermore, the relationship between the characters is kinda similar 
* In both series they travel as a team* The MC's start off immediately strong, you don't have the bullsh*t process of 50 episodes of becoming stronger* The timeline of the episodes doesn't matter, so you don't have to worry about remembering how the story went. You can still catch up after a few months without you having the feeling that you don't understand.* The music is really good by both shows.* And both shows are really enjoyable, go watch it :) 
Set in the Edo period of Japan, Champloo transforms Japanese history by including themes from the world of Hip-Hop culture and modern America. This anime features lots of great action, dialogues between lead characters and music that will have you hooked from the first action packed episode. Champloo is a great example of what I like to call a ""Journey"" anime. The plot revolves less around the ending and the place the characters are going, and more around the events and interactions that take place as they attempt to reach that destination  
Same director, different context with different music, but both series are amazing on its own. If you watch cowboy bebop, you should watch samurai champloo and viceversa.  
Both have an episodic style to it. Both use a certain style of music and era and create an interesting setting. The main characters have similar characteristics, and keep you interested with the action packed episodes. 
In both anime, you have really original and badass main characters. The story doesn't take place in the same universe, but if you are looking for a great anime with a lot of fights and action, here you are! And, the most important : EPIC MUSIC !!!!!!!! 
The main character of Samurai Champloo has a very similar personality as Spike Spiegel. Both of them have that carefree badass type of mindset. So if you liked Spike, you'll definitely like Mugen. Plus, I'm pretty sure that both shows were made by the same studio. 
Same director, very different, both extremely enjoyable. Music plays a central role in both of these, with Cowboy Bebop having mostly jazz, blues and rock and roll influences while Samurai Champloo being more hip-hop and chillhop. While they both have quite different settings there is definitely a similar feel about them. Bebop is more deep and complex than Champloo, and thus is something of a step-up or even upgrade from Champloo.  
The music is the key factor here, both have excellent songs, Jazz, Blues, Hip-Hop. Memorable moments, fights, and characters.  
Same director and same vibe. All of the episodes are episodic with variously atmospheres ranging from really funny to really serious.  
Though both shows may be set in vastly different universes, there's no denying the unique Shinichiro Watanabe touch to them. Most prominently, this can be noticed in the superior combination of good freaking music and great freaking action scenes. While one dabbles in classic blues and jazz, the other rides a wave of feel-good hiphop, all the while poignant in their themes of past, present and future.You can't watch one and dislike the other, trust me! 
Although they have a different setting, both Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo are directed by legendary Shinichiro Watanabe. These two shows are episodic, but with a good storyline that will tell more about the characters as the story unfolds. They also have an amazing soundtrack (jazz in Cowboy Bebop, hip-hop in Samurai champloo), comedy, drama and well animated action scenes. 
Both are works directed by Shinichiro Watanabe, run 26 episodes and feature a strong balance of action, comedy and drama.  Both are episodic in structure, have strong original soundtracks and have small central casts of vitriolic companions who serve as foils to each other.  Also, both works have the main character voiced by Steven Blum in the English Dub, and both dubs are great. 
A cast of flawed yet lovable characters. Episodic structure filled with random hijinks and situations. A simple premise allows for a focus on slow yet satisfying character insight and development. A mixing of genre conventions and settings.  
Music based themes, characters with a well definite personality and deep back story. 
Music is similar between these two. Same director but different settings. Funny, enjoyable from start to finish.  
Similar art style, created by the same director, both have great musical scores. 
Both are directed by Shinichiro Watanabe and are amazing absolute masterpieces of Anime. Both are shows that focus on a small group of characters and how their interactions affect each and every one of them. Both also have amazing art and action sequences that are unrivaled. These are two of the greatest Anime of all time and are a MUST-WATCH. 
Another epic show by Shinichiro Watanabe who creates his own world and style with strong main characters and the battle to obtain that sweet, sweet crunkle. (Money) 
Very similar vibe, heavy reliance on music, similar graphics.although champloo can be a bit boring 
Besides having the same director, both shows have direct parallels and contrasts in terms of characters, themes, story, tone, music and visuals.  While Cowboy Bebop offers a more philosophical approach in its overall theme, Champloo takes a more laid back, nostalgic mood that actually made it more enjoyable for me than the former.  Both shows are in my top 6 favorite anime of all time, and I'd highly suggest giving them a shot.  There are other shows that capture a similar sense of what Bebop great, but Champloo managed to do it perfectly.  See ya space samurai... 
Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo both follow the same episodic story structure using a small castt of distinct main characters. While they may differ drastically in genre (one is a Western-style Sci-Fi Drama, the other an Eastern Historic Action/Comedy), the way the characters and story are presented at a slow rate is shared well between the two. 
As Bebop, Champloo is presented as a character-based anime where with each episode you get to know more about the characters. On top of that, both are style-driven where that style is created through music, Cowboy Bebop is Jazz and in Samurai Champloo is Hip-Hop. Both are directed by Shinichiro Watanabe. 
The stories may seem very different from each other, but both give a similar vibe. Sunrise worked really hard to make these two wonderful, classic anime and it is very likely that if you liked Cowboy Beepob, you will also like Samurai Champloo. It has been said by others as well. 
The whole vibe of Cowboy Bebop I believe is present in Samurai Champloo. While Cowboy Bebop has a jazz vibe, Samurai Champloo has a hip hop vibe. They both have interesting characters that you want to learn more about as well. So just do yourself a favor a watch it, you won't regret it. P.S. I was recommend Samurai Champloo off of Cowboy Bebop and enjoyed it a lot. 
The series is also a tribute and a reinterpretation of genres of yesteryear, such as western and noir, and which are re-translated to explore human emotions and which we are often afraid to face. Loneliness and really wondering what existence is are so abstract within the narrative that you don't immediately feel when they are touched and it makes you think “If people already dominate space travel, why are the quality of human values ​​so poor? ""The characters have their nuances. They are neither white nor black, they are all gray that change depending on what needs to be resolved and are so well executed and defined at first that you can notice their evolution and understand the paths of their life, creating a sympathy with them.Cowboy Bebop is like a great book. You can take the series at any time and it will tell you something different or you will be able to identify with another aspect of the characters. read more 
-both have strong MCs-both MCs have dark past-both have a great ending-both have big rivalries-both have good fights 
it has the same kind of writing as samurai champloo in the sense that the characters feel very human like and that they all have different goals while working together 
Both include heavy themes as well as leaning far into a music style for inspiration, hip-hop for Samurai Champloo, and Jazz/Bebop for Cowboy Bebop. Each follows a cast of cool but also dysfunctional characters that are similar to each other. Both series involve the characters messing around for the most part in random events that can be both heartfelt and silly. 
Same director; Similar: level of great combination of styles (especially, music: rap + samurai and jazz/blues + space), adventure type of anime (exploring their respective worlds), episodes which are not connected strongly,  
The other recommendation that comes as no surprise to anybody: Coywboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo. While the setting and stories are very different, they star the same male lead voice actor and have a very similar energy about them. They are serious action stories that know when not to take themselves too seriously and have fun. The shows have fantastic characters and are extremely addictive. I would have put Trigun together with these to form a trio, but that's not a possibility unfortunately. 
Made by the same creatoraesthetics  
There are plenty of aspect that these 2 shows has. Even though one is set in as futuristic atmosphere, and the other is in an old era of Japan, the concept of these 2 are just feels somehow both different and similar at the same time 
-If you like a goalless ordinary team who just lead a life without any specific aim trying to ignore their miserable past , then you must watch them.-You will find some undefeatable characters who barely cares about anything.-There is almost no specific difference between spike and mugen.-And absolutely no lack comedy and background music. 
Both have an AMAZING soundtrack and even better character design. Also both in the action drama, but have some tearjerker episodes. I give both a 10/10. 
character-based anime where with each episode you get to know more about the characters. On top of that, both are style-drive where that style is created through music – Cowboy Bebop is Jazz and in Samurai Champloo is Hip-Hop. 
Both are about characters from different backgrounds forming a team together and then having to face everyone's different pasts together.Both have very similar character types and really good fight scenes. They also bing the same vibe and entertainment and both have really good music.  
same show, but SAMURAI  
If you love the adventure of following a main cast and seeing them develop from episode to episode, Samurai Champloo is the one for you. Both follow very similar formats, both being episodic and following a main cast of 3-4 unique individuals that are all lovable. Samurai Champloo also has a unique art style and music that distinguishes itself similar to Cowboy Bebop too. Overall, if you liked Bebop, you are likely to enjoy Champloo as well. "
1,2251,30,"Both of them are themed around Jazz and Blues. Both animes display alot of martial arts and gunplay. Definetily check out Baccano! if you loves Cowboy Bebop! 
The style is very similar. It has a very jazzy feel to it that fits with the show like it did with Cowboy Bebop. The characters are so loveable and unique and so different from one another like the people on Bebop. Not to mention the soundtracks have a similar feel to them. 
Baccano! is a strangely underappreciated show that has a huge cast of good characters, a compelling plot drawn from the ample source material, a soundtrack that complements the show well, action, comedy, drama, intrigue...If you appreciated what Cowboy Bebop had to offer then you'll find a lot to like in Baccano!. It's a show with definite rewatch value. 
Bebop and Baccano! are all about style. It’s the thirties: tommy guns, stars from black-and-white movies and jazz. Bebop is more like blues with its sadness and noir films features. Baccano! is a jazz like it was in really beginning, totally improvisation. You don’t know what will happen next. Great cocktail from retro, detective stories, comedy, cruelty and heartbreaks. Both these series was inspired by films like “The Godfather”, “The Untouchables” and so on. You’ll find crime families and gangland killing, fire-fights and pursuits, maniacs and comedy characters in Bebop and Baccano!Soundtrack is also magnificent, when I watched Baccano! it was like I’ve met a Yoko Kanno’s genius work for Bebop one more time. Although storytelling is extremely different, for Bebop it’s a story per episode, Baccano! is a mosaic from plotlines that fully combined, they are really similar. You'll share an entire range of emotions with each character and find that these creations are somehow cast in the same mold. read more 
Funky, badass, amazing anime with great action, animation, and music.Both have possibly the greatest characters cast ever seen.In both series you’ll find awesome fight scenes (both martial arts fights & gunfights), mafia, an immortal shota boy (Czes in Baccano, Wen in CB), and comedy despite the violence and mature contents.Both are anime that you can rewatch again and again without getting tired of them. 
the feel of these anime's is failry similar, they both are ""western"" anime and there is also a similarity in the music styles, they both also have extraordinary dubs i would go as far as to recommend the dub over the sub because it actually sounds more natural but both are great animes and should be given watch 
Both Baccano! and Cowboy Bebop have excellent visuals, jazz on the soundtrack, high-intensity fight sequences, and likable characters. 
Same kind of show : you'll find the best OST in both (jazzy, really cool), same spirit/atmosphere with really great characters/action you will enjoy all the show without any moment of boring !! I guarantee you'll not be disappointed !! 2 must-see. 
Both shows have the same tone and similar style, both have great action scenes and cool characters. 
Both have intense combat sequences that aren't just limited to hand-to-hand.While Cowboy Bebop's actual plot isn't thoroughly developed. Baccano's is highly incomprehensible until the very end.Both have great, memorable characters, dubs that fit the era, music that fits the scenes, and an enjoyment factor that skyrockets! 
Cowboy Bebop and Baccano! have a jazz filled soundtrack, slick, fluid, and detailed animation, and are bitter sweet series. 
As an anime viewer, you might be lucky enough to eventually stumble upon unforgettably great anime at one point or another. I'm here to tell you of two such anime: Baccano!, a tale of immortals and the mafia gang, and Cowboy Bebop, the journey of a former syndicate-turned-bounty-hunter.  Baccano! and Cowboy Bebop share the same atmosphere, fluid animation and clever dialogue. They are western-styled and contain lots of references to western cultures. Furthermore, the two are immensely entertaining and enjoyable anime that will keep your attention the whole journey through and leave you breathless. While Baccano! is more of a different-plots-intricately-woven-into-a-great-story kind of anime and Cowboy Bebop is more episodic, there is no doubt that if you enjoy one, you will most certainly enjoy the other.  read more 
Both have an americian cast of characters, are full of action, particualrly involving gangsters and just a general sense of coolness about them that sets them apart from other anime 
Jazz, Style, Class, Crime, Action, Drama, Romance, Comedy, Wacky characters, Psychotic characters, Mysterious characters, Smooth characters, Hand to Hand Combat, Shootouts, Oldschool feelCowboy Bebop and Baccano! are the kings of cool when it comes to anime. They both feel more like movies than actually animes and even though, each one does it differently, they both use multiple stories to tell one big story, giving you pieces of the puzzle until the end when it all comes togetherThey both also make great additions to what I like to call the ""Jazzy Crime Anime"" trilogy which includes Cowboy Bebop, Baccano!, and Lupin The 3rd.They both certainly have their differences but there's no denying that they both go great hand and hand with each other. After watching both, you're gonna wanna go out, buy a nice suit, learn martial arts and get into gunfights. Both of them are 10/10 masterpieces, check them out. Oh and they both have fantastic dubs that are more fitting than the sub versions because of how Westernized the two shows are read more 
Both of them heavily influenced on American culture and have the vintage/retro style. Especially choice of soundtracks are very similiar, jazz and blues mostly. They both have smooth/charismatic characters like in Quentin Tarantino movies with their witty and badass dialogues.  
Both have the same jazzy, easy come, easy go attitude and a very lovable and energetic cast composed of gangsters, gunslingers, and silver-tongued thieves. 
Both anime have great jazz soundtracks. Jazz music is almost exclusively used in both anime. The openings of both anime is really popular precisely because of their upbeat, jazzy music.Also, both anime have a lot of melee combat. 
1: AWESOME FIGHT SCENES!2: Both have really good character development3: Jazzy feeling (best way I can describe it)    
If you liked the jazzy element to Cowboy Bebop, you'll definitely like this! 
Both contain an outstanding jazz/blues style soundtrack, and also contain a decent amount of action involving both guns and fists. They also have a cast of unique and compelling characters that all get at least a little development (though the main character cast of Baccano! is much bigger, despite being shorter). Both also have excellent English dubs, a possible persuasion for those who may predominantly prefer subs. 
They have similar music styles throughout the shows, both having one of the best opening songs I've ever heard. Both have a lot of violence and shooting. They both have awesome characters as well. They both have multiple stories being shown that tangle up for the final outcome. Also they both have something about organized crimes.  
They are both rule of cool shows, with Baccano being more over the top and having supernatural aspects to it.In terms of story Baccano is far more impressive by having multiple random events being interwoven and connecting with each other by the 13th episode. Bebop is episodic so it tells a different story in each episode.In terms of Art and Animation. Baccano looks more realistic and it is more detailed than Bebop, but Bebop is prettier to look at and it has a more original art style. Bebop also inches ahead in terms of animation by being more fluid while being a much older and longer show.In terms of characters they are equal. Baccano has a much larger as but doesn't get nearly as much development as Bebop. While Bebop has a smaller cast that is just as enjoyable but also gets development. read more 
Baccano! and Cowboy Bebop have a very similar cool and jazzy atmosphere. The music and intros of both shows are also similar; both intros are swingy jazz tunes. Both these shows are specifically great for western audiences, and they both have superb English dubs. 
Are you ready for special dangerous parties? Be alive.Both main organizations are gangster. Extremely humorous and enjoyable. Coolness and action-packed.OP songs are very similar. It's jazz. Baccano! has vocal version. This one also great.Spike and Issac can share similar personalities. They have very positive thinking and lucky things.I can't write more both characters similarities because too big cast. Nevertheless, favorites are many.CB is more longer, serious plot and ultra dramatic. Baccano! has some bloody scenes and complex settings.Both are really amazing classics. I love both of them so much. Worth watching if you prefer gunman style. 
Just like Bebop, Baccano's fight scenes are primarily with guns and hand to hand combat. Baccano provides likable characters and great character development. It has the same Jazz music that lends itself magnificently to the atmosphere of the series, and gives the viewer what Bebop did not for the majority of the series, a plot. Albeit the plot is almost impossible to understand until you progress into the series, it is expanded upon gradually throughout each episode.  
Both have jazz and music like that but also center around gun fighting and martial arts 
If you are a fan of ""Baccano!"" then you know what good story telling is.  You understand pacing, timing, character development, and solid endings.  ""Cowboy Bebop"" also embodies the qualities that make up a masterpiece, and ""Baccano!"" is a masterpiece in it's own right.  
Both have a good jazz soundtrack, they both have amazing fight scenes and they both have unbelevibale dubs. 
If you're looking for great fighting scenes with a little bit of jazz playing in the background, look no further than Baccano! for your next anime fix. Much like Cowboy Bebop, this show also has a lot of action-packed scenes and is also placed in 1930's Chicago, so you know the music is pretty good. Szilard and his aide, Ennis, are looking for the missing bottles that contain the elixir of immortality, but there's also a lot going on in the background—like mafia wars, for example. The alchemists are on a road to find out the true price for immortality.  
Both being the best anime which contains jazz and have fun characters with alot of mayhem except some moments in cowboy bebop where it gets slightly darker. Don't forget their op's. "
1,13601,13,"Both Protagonists are kinda labeled as the anti-heroes and both have a dark past which both have antagonists that can be compared to with Vicious and Makishima. Set in a futuristic world with a Noir atmosphere, its a must see! 
Both anime share a near future setting where technology has an important role in society. Kougami is a character similar to Spike in the way they think and both have an archnemesis which wants to play with their mind and twist it.Cowboy Bebop has a unique style, while Psycho-Pass tries to put the viewer to reason about society.  Psycho-Pass will surely not disappoint Cowboy Bebop fans. 
Psycho-Pass has that dark futuristic adult story telling just like Cowboy Bebop minus the Jazz. 
Both series are set in the future and center around police work, cowboy bebop specifically bounty hunting. Kougami and Spike are very similar in personality as well as Makishima and Vicious. 
How do I put this... Cowboy Bebop is like the tv series Firefly but grittier and cooler. Psycho-Pass has a Cowboy Bebop feel but it's like a mix o Bebop, Bladerunner and the Minority Report with a tad of Equilibrium thrown in there. Both are Sci-Fi, both have the ""cool"" factor, and both are filled with great animation, music and characters.If you love either of these then I really can't imagine not loving the other. Both are amazing action Sci-Fi series! 
story is not related..hands downbut i found the main characters similarspike spiegel = shinya Kougamiboth have a dark pastthe arch nemesis of both the characters are similar in some ways to the protagonist in either of the seriesall in all its a must watch!!psycho pass has a great story 
-Both series take place in the near future-Both series have a main male protagonist who uses guns and has a badass attitude (Spike being the layed-back, energetic kind while Shinya is the more calm, collected kind)-Both series have great action scenes 
»Dark tone»Action-oriented»Cast of very likable characters»Strong male lead with reckless behavior and great skill»Strong antagonist role with twisted ties to the male lead»Plot revolves around the main characters hunting down and chasing criminals»Futuristic setting»Great English dub 
Both Spike and Kogami remind me of one another- dark past - enemy they're bent on getting revenge on for hurting someone they cared for The supporting characters are also interesting bc like cowboy bebop, each supporting character has their own stories that are told Also set in the future, with action/crime elements embedded in both  
If you liked Psycho-Pass's characters, you will likely like Cowboy Bebop's characters. Spike Spiegel and Shinya Kougami have an almost exact personality match, except Spike is a little more... humorous. Vicious and Shōgo Makishima are also very similar in terms of intelligence and looks. Shōgo is definitely more cunning. Jet Black and Nobuchika Ginoza are also very similar. They have a similar backstory, overall demeanor and even looks. Both Spike and Shinya are main protagonists and both Shogo and Vicious are main antagonists. Spike and Jet's companionship is similar to Shinya and Nobuchika's companionship. There's not really too many similarities beyond that other than the dark vibes from both shows.You should watch Cowboy Bebop anyways for nothing else if you've never seen it. It's considered one of the many classics of anime history. read more 
Though Psycho-Pass takes many cues from Ghost in the Shell and has a concept of ruling the system with the status quo identical to that of Death Note as opposed by the antagonist, it too with the rivalry of Kogami vs Makishima related to Spike vs Vicious.After being affected by a certain tragedy, Kogami and Spike pursue their career with a crew dealing with various villains in an episodic fashion leading to their confrontation from the past as Makishima and Vicious rolls in. Akane like Faye are the main female leads who have yet to experience a harsh fact of reality of their life and careerGinoza like Jet shares a friendly dynamic sidekick with the mc Shion shares most of the techy and monitoring the gang's actions with EdwardFor some reason, Urobuchi is a fan of Bebop and I take it that this for some reason is the reincarnation of Bebop in a sci fi setting and the only difference is that the main cast is now working for the government to enforce justice to maintain the status quo. read more 
You get a very similar thrill watching Psycho Pass as you do with Cowboy Bebop. It also has to be said that watching the battle between one of the main protagonists and the antagonist feels like deja vu.  
Part of what makes Cowboy Bebop so great is its leading protagonist, Spike. We know about his dark past and throughout the show he's sort of labeled as an anti-hero. The same could be said of Psycho-Pass, who's lead is similarly dark. The setting is fairly similar in that it's futuristic and has a noir feel to it. The entire show revolves around a new kind of policing that determines the state of mind of citizens before they even commit a crime. However, this system seems to have some serious faults.  "
1,918,13,"You can beat me up, but they're really almost the same. Firstly it's the plot structure - combination of serious and comedy episodes is the main feature for both, different length (26 eps vs >150 eps) doesn't stop them from showing some bizarre and random unconnected stories for one or few episodes length with some great story line behind the scene. Secondly it's the characters, Gintoki resembles Spike in all respects, they're both easygoing attractive guys with some dark past and fellows that was their friends but now they're enemies; you can beat me up one more time, but I think Kagura was created under the impression of Edward, they're both red, crazy, have some special unique skills and travel with dogs, though the main similarity is the ""crazy"" part; Jet and Shinpachi... I think if you try hard enough you'll find some similarities even between those guys. But the main thing putting those series together is an atmosphere that resembles normal life of mere human without any superpowers, and of course the fact that characters always have problems with supplies and tackle unprofitable jobs just in the cause of their mellowness. By the way, Sunrise is a producer for both of them. read more 
What makes both series similar is the episodic progression of their stories. For instance, most of the episodes are one shot plots that take the characters across the galaxy trying to earn a decent buck while meeting new and old pals along the ride. Each series has it's share of seriousness as well as wacky humor. Lastly, Gintoki and Spike both have fuzzy hair. 
Both have a, for the most part, a stand alone plot structure. Have a surprisingly unique and fresh cast of characters. Are easy to watch/enjoy, and hardly ever get boring.And they both have leads that care MUCH more than they let on...Gintama parodies multiple cultures, stereotypes, and doesn't take itself too seriously.Cowboy Bebop has a breathtaking approach to it's stories, is subtly funny, and ambigously ends. 
In both animes every episode is unique. In different style and without an overall continuous plot. Also the main characters are very similar. Always broke and doing jobs for money 
Both are about chill male characters who can't tolerate injustice. The characters do work and are hungry for money. Kagura is like a mix of Faye and Ed, having Ed's childishness and Faye's impulsiveness and combativeness. 
The similarity lies in the main protagonist of both series. Both Gintoki and Spike are laid-back, cool, casual 20-something year old men who had a dark past. Now, they just find random jobs with their partners and go through their daily lives. They have their fair share of bad habits, but when it matters, they pull through and become badass.  
Both anime are mostly episodic and both mix comedy and action.The protagonists of both anime at first seem indifferent and laid-back,but in reality they hide a dark past and both are skilled fighters. 
they both have short random and funny episodes and good action scenes and in both anime a small group of people take on jobs to earn some money. but gintama has better comedy and cowboy is classy and has more action. but they do resemble each other a lot  
I never thought I would compare them, but I can see many similarities. First, both belong to the same study, Sunrise. Then, in most important aspects, we have the MCs, Gintoki and Spike, both have a sad and dark past who have decided to overcome, but they still feel guilty. Their personalities are similar. They have an old comrade who became the enemy. In both anime, Yorozuya and the team aboard the Bebop, are quite peculiar and charismatics. These groups are poor and unable to complete any work. The series are episodic, Gintama more focused on comedy and satire, accompanied by drama and action, while in Cowboy Bebop focuses more on action, drama and existential questions. Space environment. Well, Gintama and Cowboy Bebop are a little similar, but uniques and highly recommended.  read more 
While Gintama is longer and more comedy oriented (although it gets very serious when it needs to) it has the same basic layout as Bebop. Group of misfits trying to scrape by in life through various jobs, they almost never come out of it with money but there is usually a take away message. You also start off not knowing much about the main characters as their stories unfold throughout the entirety of the anime.  
The two series constantly switch between comedy and drama, being very good at both. Both shows are set in the near future, where our present technology is merged with sci-fi components, like flying cars and space travel. Both main characters, Gintoki and Spike, have a mysterious past and now work as freelancers taking crazy jobs for money - which they screw up more times than not, often because of their sense honor or for just being sloppy. Both are also constantly haunted by their past, in the form of old comrades that turned into outlaws or old friends that passed away. 
- Both have an MC whose past is mysterious and dark- Both animes have both light and serious tones around them- Both have characters that are similar to each other:    - Sadaharu is like Ein as their the dogs of the group    - Shinpachi is like Jet, being the straight man of the group    - Kagura is like Ed, being the goofy kid     - Takasugi is like Vicious, being the antagonist who the MC has worked or fought with - Both animes are based on more or less a free lance jobs where they barely can pay for their needs    read more 
Both the animes tend to provide us with an odd job MC who are gintoki and spike  who though they appear to be lazy they tend to be skilled fighter, with a part dark history related to their past . Both the stories shows intergalactic traveling and aliens too "
1,467,9,"Futuristic animes that have characters who are Kick Ass! The main characters in both animes, the Major for GITS and Spike for Bebop, both have strong convictions and an unknown past that fuels their character's values.  
Sci-fi anime set in the near future that focus on criminal investigation (bounty hunters/cyber crime police). Both are filled with back to back episodes of intense action driven by a wonderfully jazzy soundtrack composed by Yoko Kanno. 
Amazingly crafted sci-fi future settings, conveyed through episodic crime drama. Both shows develop their characters through a series of self-contained sequences, while also having elements of an overarching plot, and ending the series with a focus that plot. If you are looking for a series that can be both episodic and sharply reflective on its characters, these two are the way to go. Should also be mentioned that lauded composer Yoko Kanno made the OST for both. 
First, both anime have a lot of sci-fi stuff in them, but one thing that really makes them similar is how in both anime, the main characters are always trying to catch some criminal. Of course, in Ghost in the Shell the main characters are cops while in Cowboy Bebop the main characters are bounty hunters which does make the anime a little different. Ghost in the Shell's story is much more complex, while Cowboy Bebop is more free and wild. However, both are petty serious anime, except there are a lot of times that I laughed while watching Cowboy Bebop. They also both have lots of actions scenes of people shooting each other. Also, in Cowboy Bebop, I think I related to the characters more, but in both anime all the characters still have this unstoppable pursuit to catch their target. read more 
Both are heavy on the characters, specifically a group of people banded together seemingly for work only, but who become friends in the process. An overwhelming majority of the episodes is action-packed, with some being a part of a greater storyline and some - individual stories. Although the setting is completely different, they give off similar vibes and rely on akin formulas. 
Both shows are mostly episodic sci-fi shows with heavily character driven stories that play on the complexities of their own sci-fi world while retaining a certain level of relatability to the viewer. Ghost in the Shell SAC does a slightly better job at world building and  features more engaging and and philosophical stories than Bebop but this is obviously subjective. Both shows also feature well choreographed fight scenes and kick-ass sound tracks by Yoko Kanno. 
These anime share a similar plot structure: we have a different case/adventure in most of the episodes while still retaining a background main plot. Throughout the story we learn more about each MC personality and past. If you like futuristic action and some mature themes, you got here two anime perfect for you. The crew in Cowboy Bebop is more of a 'bandit crew' while the crew in GitS is an investigation team and everything would point that they are opposite poles but they actually share many similarities. Just take in mind the settings and world are quite different. 
Both are episodic cyber-noir series with soundtracks composed by Yoko Kanno running 26 episodes.  Both series feature the protagonists confronting memorable and unique criminals each episode, and both have excellent dubs.  Both series also heavily feature gun-play. 
Both shows are believable visions of crime in the future; Cowboy Bebop is about bounty hunters, while Ghost in the Shell is a cop show. They are both mostly episodic but some episodes are tied together by an ongoing plot that reveals some characters' backstories. They both also have excellent art, animation, and music. "
1,40052,6,"The entire time watching Great Pretender, it reminded me of Cowboy Bebop. Similar vibes (except the melancholy romance in CB was not present) where people with different personalities & background teaming up to do bad things. The opening songs are also similar. 
Strong people doing dangerous things.Both deal with A-class crime and tragedy. Pretty cool character development.Spike and Laurant can share similarities. They're so handsome and have very hard pasts.Opening visuals and music also very similar. GP is influenced by CB, I guess.CB has better story but GP has better visuals. Each Western and American style will attract you. 
The generally episodic nature of Great Pretender (GP) and Cowboy Bepop (CB) are very similar! Great character focus and development so far in GP and of course in CB as well. Nice mini series within an overarching narrative in both pieces. Great heist vibes jive well with futuristic bounty hunting, though wildly different, they meld well together. Great music in both!If you like either CB or GP you defs need to watch both for sure! 
Both of these stories put a heavy emphasis on character development and how the character's past has shaped them. 
For me, Great Pretender had this vibe that reminded me alot of Cowboy Bebop. The story is in some ways comparable and just an all around fun to watch show. 
The energy that the show gives if is honestly very similar with its own new, refreshing style, if you liked cowboy beepop i highly recommend "

Its pretty similar to Evangelion.Why? the introspective characters, the development of the trama, good soundtrack, a really good and subtle.

1,1575,5,"Cowboy Bebop earns its reputation for its combination of fighting and original character matchings, as does Code Geass. If you liked Spike, Zero takes it to a much larger scale when Spike's close range combat is bought into the scale of international war. 
The strength of these shows lies in the charming and cool characteristics that the protagonist exudes. Spike from Cowboy Bebop is exhibits the chill and relaxed type of cool, while Lelouch from Code Geass shows more charisma and passion in his goals. Also, both shows have fights in different mode, such as gun fights, mecha fights (in CB, it's space ship), and clash of ideals. Did I mention that both are made by Sunrise? 
Both feature laid back formidable main characters (Lelouch & Spike). Both have sci-fi influence and amazingly designed mecha/machinery. Both characters have a mysterious past intrinsic to the plot of the show.  
Arguably the top notch shows of their era that defines their quality and writing.The main protagonists Lelouch and Spike are characters that you can relate in real life unlike standard anime.The themes of both shows really touch my heart to the point that it feels mature to the point that I can apply in real life.Even a non anime fan can take these shows a shot so that limited selection can be shown to those who have an avid interest.Definitely recommend one or the other if you saw one. 
Although Code Geass and Cowboy Bebop are vastly different, skilful in their own respect Lelouch and Spike set off with their right-hand man, Jet and C.C. along an incredible journey filled with great action, and the many different abstract books that of people create for themselves.Both are great sci-fi anime classics both brought to you by the studio Sunrise. "
1,329,4,"They have -go with the flow- underdog characters. Episodic sctructure uses the routine of dealing with people's problems around as the main story progresses. Both puts importance in scientific and engineering accuracy and realistic future depiction. Their animation fluidity goes up a notch in action heavy scenes. 
I'd say they both start off with more or less the same way, however planetes shoot off with an Arc halfway throught the series while Cowboy Bebop has no particular arc until the last few episodes.But both animes explored the character really well throughout the series which then results a brilliant ending, they are both comedic, they are both set in space, and they have more or less the lowest of jobs(Taking out the Trash and a Bounty Hunter) Whenever I watched both anime I can't seem to stop myself from thinking of the other. If you liked Planetes, you'll like Cowboy Bebop. and the same if you liked Cowboy Bebop you'll like Planetes. Both are amazing animes if you haven't watched it, WATCH IT NOW! read more 
Both shows are character-driven shows set in space with a rag-tag group of unlikely companions. Both series have light-hearted and often comical overtones with serious and thought-provoking moments that often deal with very relevant issues in current society. Both series also get a little darker/more serious towards end. 
Both Planetes and Cowboy Bebop emits a similar sense of style, as they are both space anime containing some action with episodic storytelling. Planetes differs with additional quirkiness, a larger focus of its characters, further developments of its concepts and the input of romance. While Cowboy Bebop differs with a larger focus on the action, its sense of adventure and its music. If you like one for its sense of creative style you'll be sure to like the other. "

If you really like jazz, this is a show, set in the sixties, about a boy who forms friends through music. 
From the same director, and with a lot of marvelous music. It blend space scientific fiction, old west and blues/jazz/folk to create a unique theme. 
Same writer/director, same composer. Recommended for people who watched Bebop and loved the music, but perhaps wanted to see the music incorporated even more into the plot. You don't have to be a musician or even a music fan to like either of these series. The inclusion of jazz in the development of Watanabe's always wonderful characters makes for an extremely heartfelt and short series. "

His rivalry with Kirei is reminiscent to that of Spike vs Vicious because both rivals are the only characters who can kill them self proclaimed and in power.Characters split in factions to compete for power in Bebop's case, it is bounty hunters and F/Z's case, it is magicians.Though split in various ways and are focused, I find some F/Z's characters to be similar to Bebop's:Irisviel-JuliaSaber-FayeRider-JetWaver-Edward read more "

Main character of Cowboy Bebop, Spike, and Ash of Banana Fish are traumatized, and each one has to constantly carry the weight of his past. These are two excellent anime, but no matter how fun it starts in the beginning, - do not kid yourself, - you WILL cry.  
I feel like the main characters, Ash and Spike, are actually quite similar. They both are characters with emotional and traumatic pasts they're trying to run away from but they keep being pulled back into what they're trying to escape from. They both have a similar emotional and character arc, and especially Ash's story about the 'leopard in the snowy mountain' and Spike's story about the 'tiger striped cat' make me feel like fans of one character might really like the other too. "

I found some character similarities, Kiritsugu=Spike, Kirei=Vicious, Rider=Jet and Kiritsugu's band has the same amount that Spike has. Trust me it's linear since each episodes focuses on the story then they show backstories and pasts, etc. 
F/Z's second half is what you call Bebop's 2nd half in plot and ending.Spike and Kiritsugu continue to fight but at the same time unable to move on from their past.Death counts take toll and moments with realism will destroy idealism to the point that the world is a cruel place in reality.Gen Urobuchi is one reason why the story is great and even helping the 2nd half defines the show to update Bebop to it's modern setting with high caliber animation, soundtrack, and voice acting.One can say that F/Z's popularity in Japan makes it the Japanese version of Bebop due to it's popularity in the West. read more "

Monster and Death Note are unique in many ways. In both cases the issue of morality in its truest form, that is the frontier between good and evil, is explored via highly tense psychological thrillers. Monster is highly realistic and portrays a very believable world while Death Note has a supernatural element to it; in both the viewer is forced to think and make choices toward deciding who the real villains are and just what it is that makes one individual evil.  
Both are psychological thriller and suspense. The only difference is that Death Note is more supernatural while Monster is more dramatic. If you like Monster, then surely you'll like Death Note, vice-versa.  
Both feature main characters who are being chased by detectives. While Monster may be more mature, Death Note is just as good but more supernatural 
Both are high ranking thriller that will have you at the edge of your seat screaming for more. The mysteries and plot twists will leave your head spinning off its shoulders. I give it 10/10! A true Masterpiece! 
Both animes revolve around gone-berserk (methinks) guys. Each of their stories are mature, too-- both practically deal about murder, death, and whatnot. 
Its almost Basically the Same mystery/horror Good Guy vs Bad Guy type of Story except that The 2 Main Characters of the Show Kill for different reasons  
Both have plots that don't focus on action, instead they focus on the minds and personalities of the characters and how they interact with eachother. Both also have that kind of battle of 2 characters through non-direct attacks. 
A couple of good guys come together to hunt down a psychotic mass murderer. A macabre game of 'cat and mouse' ensues, leaving the viewer at the edge of his seat. The story in both cases goes at a very complex depth, and so do the characters.  In Monster, the story is much more complex, and focuses more on character development. Monster grapples with issues of morality and is a bit more philosophical. 
Both have amazing characters, good animation and a FANTASTIC STORY!  they are both about a serial killer but they are a little different from each other:). U will get addicted immediately! These are one of the best ever made. 
Both anime are psychological thrillers dealing with never ending battle/chase between good and evil. Both plots are full of twists and cliffhangers although the pacing of the two series are quite different. Death Note has a faster pacing with more focus on the main few characters while Monster introduces many side characters in depth through different arcs.   
Both shows deal with similar topics: equality of human life, good vs. evil, the right of a killer to live, etc. Whereas Death Note is more concentrated on the cerebral task of investigation, Monster's focus is on morality and redemption. Both of them are top-notch, but I find Monster to be better overall. 
Intellectual game between two brilliant characters that makes you wait to see the next episode. 
Death Note is a anime about crime, however it the character are top noch and the story-line keeps you at the edge of your seat. You sometimes end up trying to guess who will lose their life next and how it all will end however, i can say you will be hooked on this anime till the ultimate end. I highly recommend this anime to anyone and everyone.  
These series are both brilliant, compelling and you can't get enough of either of them! It's hard to say why these two series are like each other, i think it's the sence of justice and the practactly the same morals. Both of 'em will have you off your seat, guesting what will happen next. 
Both are psychological, detective dramas. The difference being that Monster is a seinen and Death Note is a shonen hence Monster has none of the annoying characters and general bull that goes on in Death Note. 
Both are psychological thrillers. While in Death Note there is heavily influenced by the supernatural, Monster is more realistic, and could even happen in real life. If you liked one, you should watch the other. There's a nice chance that you'll like it. 
These are both long, enveloping stories in which a mystery is trying to be solved.Both are extremely good and worth watching. Classic Anime. 
both anime contains elements of thriller, dark atmosphere, psychology, morality... And incredibly interesting plot!!! 
Both these compelling thriller animes, have morals. Hidden in the characters past, or beliefs, even the plot, there are morals. These two animes are brilliant, will leave a lasting impression. 
Both amazing thrillers that will keep you on the edge of your seat until you have completed them. 
Monster and Death Note both are psychological thrillers. Both are full of mysteries, although Death Note is more involved with the police system, and solving crime, while Monster is a mystery which the main character is trying to solve basically on his own. Both have that dark, psychological thriller feel to them, and keep you captivated throughout the whole series (although Monster is quite a bit longer than Death Note). 
Death Note and Monster both share the common theme of Justice. They both look quite deeply into human nature, and they are also both quite dark. Whilst the main characters in Monster and Death Note are almost polar opposites, the idea of a 'battle of the minds' is in both series'.  
It's really hard creating a long running thriller series in the medium of animation, mainly because animation doesn't have any real, live-action actors to evoke some kind of terror in front of a camera. Both Death Note and Monster have presented exhilarating concepts that feels totally unprecedented in the thriller genre. 
Monster is very similiar with this anime in terms of it's atmosphere and the main idea that wanted to present to audiences. They both have depressing, dark and thrilling atmosphere and it keeps going that way until the end. They both critize the system of their own time. Death Note critizes justice in 21st century Japan, Monster critizes 20th century Germany, especially Nazi rulership times with the orphanage incidents in the anime. These were very powerful critiques. They both have very memorable characters, especially the antagonists. They both are very evil but have their own reasons, their own purposes for their actions and these are the characters that makes us to question our own understandings, our moralities. Lastly, both of them have top-notch and gripping plots. You never want to stop going. Well, Death Note has more complex and witty plot with more twists. Still, Monster is enough to satisfy. It is more stable but more realistic, still worth to watch. read more 
Both anime deals with the protagonist fighting the antagonist. The character that is considered evil is considered a monster and serial killer, having cops chase after them, usually having to deal with a very intelligent policeman. 
Monster is an excellent anime. The only anime that has great suspense and mystery, and the only anime that can change the speed of heartbeat. So if you liked death note defintely check out the more supenseful Monster! 
In the world of Death Note and Monster exists a dark atmosphere and tone involving crimes, murders, and conspiracy. Both of these series are an excellent watch for those interested in for some psychological thriller themes.Both series employs violence as well as plot holes and twists that can keep a viewer glued at their seats.The psychological element of both series are present with a lot of mind twists and intelligence. Speaking of which, the main protagonist in both series are quite intelligent and cunning as with the antagonists. Both series also deals with detective fiction and the exploration of law and identity. There are moral questions involved in both series with philosophical ideas in each episode. As such, both series has a complex plot and development that focuses on events involving the main characters. Both series features murders and some other mature themes but are an excellent watch. read more 
They both involve a serial killer. But it's different. Monster is more serious. Death Note pulls you in more. They're both good, but I like Death Note best. It's cool. 
Both are very dark, have complex and interesting stories with antagonist characters that are very witty, intelligent, conniving and or just outright dangerous.  
Because has got interesting plot and  cat and mouse game like Death Note. 
They been compared thousand of times in different sites worldwide. They initially look so different but watching more you will realize that have the same issues that they want to convey: What is the extent of what human beings can do? 
Like Death Note, Monster is a crime based, psychological thriller with thought-provoking themes and a realistic atmosphere. If you're looking for a charismatic villain similar to Light Yagami, Monster has that covered too. Its main villain is both charming and frightening, and he doesn't become an arrogant prick as Light does as the series progresses. While it's much longer than Death Note, don't be discouraged. It keeps focus on its central themes the entire time and paces its story in a skillful manner. 
They're both mystery anime about a criminal mastermind 
I don't want to sound like a broken tape recorder and just state the obvious. Yes; these are both mystery/thriller/drama/crime. Yes; it involves mind games and the debate of good vs. evil. Though the main difference that people leave out is that Monster is more mature in the sense that the majority of the characters are full grown adults with hardships, motivations, and not the ""I'm crazy because I laugh a lot"" aspect that most shows portray. The world of Monster is so believable that it seems like an obscure story that the world forgot about. I admit it's 74 episodes and a bit slow paced but it's totally worth it. After watching Death Note and moving on to this is the perfect move. read more 
Death Note is a very popular anime that most people probably have watched or have heard of at one point. While there are no anime that are exactly exciting and stimulating as Death Note, Monster also has its alluring side. If you liked to watch brain battles between Light and L, you should love the struggles Dr. Tenma goes through to fix his past mistake in Monster. Dare I say the atmosphere between Dr. Tenma and Johan was one of the best thriller material. If you loved Monster, you would love Death Note as well. Death Note is more fictional while Monster is more realistic. I was personally able to relate to Dr. Tenma, which made Monster that much more an enjoyable series. read more 
Both have opposing ideas of justice, and are essentially crime detection thrillers.  
I don't actually think that they are similar with story line but, similarity to both of these shows are genres, like ""Police, Psychological, Thriller"". Both of these animes have big role in Police stuff, finding the main suspect of all murders. The stories are really deep, so deep that it makes you want to keep watching all night, because  every episode you watch, it leaves some unsolved mystery , crime  and it's hard to leave and stop watching. Story is really psychological in both series, you need to keep up with the story and try to understand the main purpose of the series, characters talk smart with deep meaning. So that's why I think they are similar, I could write more but I do not want To spoil the story, you won't regret watching these two series, they are long and enjoyable.  read more 
Both are top-tier anime for the mystery genre. They are very entertaining and well-done. If nothing else binds these two anime together, then their flawlessness would do just that. Regardless of whether or not you are fans of this genre, it is still highly likely that you will come to love and enjoy both of these vastly entertaining titles. 
Both series are masterpieces who have very psychological plots and prota-antagonists who are too smart and sick.Both have a dark atmosphere and characters who are going after the crazy ones. 
As a person who was magnetized by Death Note's unique plot and beautiful characters and as someone who rated it a 10, I have to say, starting Monster was one of the best decisions I made in my life. I know you are out there. You. Who loves DN so much that you cant find something that can stand next to it. But I did. I found it. Believe me Monster will not dissapoint you. The plot might not be the same. But...how do I put this  into words.Monster has the same vibe as Death Note. They are made of the same material. They are the two sides of the same coin. read more 
Monster is similar to Death Note in terms of tension the series brings with. But else than Death Note it needs a few more episodes until it really gets you. Overall Monster is even better than Death note, but that is just my opinion.Thriller Fans should definitely take a look!(There is a bug with recommendation order, it should say if you liked Death Note you might like Monster) 
After watching death note I couldn't find an anime that would be as good as this one. But when I tried Monster I knew that they are alike.The story is really good. You might thing that for this anime there's too much episodes, but no. All these episodes are for a great character and story developing. You loved Kira and L, you're gonna love doctor Tenma, Johan, Lunge and others.  Both animes gets you more affected to the characters and story. Choosing the sides  good or evil.Both Death note and Monster has a dark atmosphere, great story and characters, soundtracks and what I really love is the art style. It's not the anime with the rainbow hairstyles and eyes. It's realistic. Also many details and it's really beautiful. read more 
The thing that makes Monster similar to Death note is the unexpected events that happen. Every episode excites you and makes you wonder ""What's going to happen next?"" Both of them have psychological points in them.  By watching these two anime, you get the feeling that the Mangakas really are geniuses, having the ability to come up with such ideas. Monster is more realistic than Death Note, since Death Note involves Shinigamis and all. (Death Gods) And the art in Death Note is a lot better. Maybe at first you won't be able to accept the drawing style in Monster, but you'll get used to it after watching a few episodes. It won't bother you at all. I highly recommend both of these anime. read more 
both brilliant and engaging psychological thrillers that are mainly driven by the dialouge. both seem sort of upbeat at some points but have underlying dark tones of murder, isolation, and insanity, accompanied by the whole detective/police thing that drove so many people to watch death note. monster and death note show that in mentally taxing situations the human psyche will do whatever it can to save itself. 
Both are mystery thriller anime which focus on a game of cat and mouse between the main protagonists. They both deal with similar themes and raise several philosophical questions about morality. In both anime, the protagonists have to make hard moral choices. Also, they both have genius detectives chasing serial killers. While Monster is more realistic & complex and has more character development, both anime create a similar atmosphere that keeps the watcher at the edge of their seats. 
These two anime are similar in the way that they both delve really deeply into the minds of psychopaths, Johan and Light, respectively. However I feel like Monster did it in a more ""show, don't tell"" sort of way, which I preferred. Whereas in Death Note, a lot of the thoughts going through the characters are spoken on screen. Both these anime also explore the backgrounds and characters of the villains as much as they do the heroes. I've always seen Light as the villain of Death Note, he kills because of his ego, nothing more. Johan kills because he wants to see the end. These two are relatable because their motives disgusting but yet understandable. I also find that L and Inspector Lunge bear very strong resemblances to each other, they are both cold, emotionless and absolutely single minded when they are working.Both of these came out at roughly the same time, albeit having distinctively different art styles, the colours and contrasts used are strikingly similar.Death Note does contain some supernatural elements to it, where as Monster is set in our universe. read more 
They both deal with mortality and justification of an evil power for good. 
I see the two works as something of a sibling relationship.Monster representing the serious, slow-burning, down to earth older brotherly figure, and the other, while not necessarily eclipsed by the former's shadow, the stylish loudmouth, the flamboyant yet self aware younger sibling.Both works definitely exploring grounds of similar nature, yet never really in the same way. Where one celebrates its flirting with its themes and undertones of power, the other arrives after the party, picture cops with flashlights at night, slowly investigating the beginning, the middle, and the aftermath of what occured. 
Just like L needs to seek out Kira, Dr Tenma must seek out the monster. They are both psychological thrillers and created to make you think . 
The use of detective logic is well constucted through both series. Both of the plots are built up through a cat and mouse game.  
The story quite different indeed, but for someone who likes psychological anime Monster is one of the best, if not the best anime I can recommend. 
First, both shows have complex stories concerning-- revolving around human sense of justice & morality. Both shows produce insanely complex character identities, overall rare one in the world characters. Both have weird uneasy atmosphere that keeps you cautious-- maybe because of dark more-to-the-realistic artstyle, or because of the intense soundtracks... Overall, both are very similar in almost every aspect. 
Both have interesting and compelling charactersBoth raise interesting moral and psychological questionsboth have amazing soundtracks which bring the series to lifeboth have amazing suspense and drama  Overall I loved both animes and would definitely recommend watching both  
Both are dark animes that are serious,both are about mysteries and the psicology of their characters,both are well animated by Madhouse,Kira and Johan are great manipulating people's mind and both are villains.Both are great animes and have well done characters. 
Both series are intense psychological thrillers that manage to create an excellent dark atmosphere, and if you liked one, you will probably like the other.  They are similar, but at the same time very different.  They both focus on different aspects of their genre, but nail just about everything they do.  I would say Death Note is more of a thriller and Monster is more psychological, but that's not to say they aren't both great at accomplishing both. 
Both have a very dark storyline with an protagonist and antagonist who come into conflict. They both also touch on what is means to be evil, and how evil is made.  
They have a similarly themed thriller, besides being the same animation studio (madhouse), its design is also bantaste similar images, the characters are very real in both works. 
Life, death and justice are the main themes of Death Note and Monster. Death Note is a good way to introduce the psychology and the themes of Monster for a younger audience. 
Both stories play out like a large scale cat-and-mouse game with a serial killer on one end and a detective on the other. They both deal with and explore complex moral dilemmas and psychology. The main difference between these two is that Death Note deals with a supernatural element, whereas Monster is grounded in reality, and thus, more dramatic. 
Both have dark atmospheres, and have strong characters. They both are psychological shows (at least have psychological aspects similar to each other). They are both about the value of life, and the consequences of you taking it away. They both have tragic heroes and intellectual terrifying villains. The stories are different but the tones are similar. 
Both animes are investigative and deal with Crimes. But their similarities end there. While Monster deals realistically with the theme, Death Note adds Supernatural as a way of controlling events. 
The anime is mostly psychological, like death note, but doesn't have any super natural elements in it. It's set in Germany.You follow Kenzo Tenma, a japanese man that studied in germany and became the best neurosurgeon. He is married to the chief's daughter and had a bright future in front of him. But everything changes when he does against the chiefs orders and saves a kids life instead of the mayor. I won't really say anything else, but this is the first episode of the anime. You follow Tenma trying to find the kid that he saved, figure out who he is and try to kill him. There are also amazing side characters and everyone is developed nicely. There are not too many characters in the anime.  read more 
Both have various discussions about what is right and wrong in our society, as well as an excellent characterization of human corruption and the value of life. 
Both have very dark themes but also have moral grays. What really is the right thing to do? And, how can one resolve something that seems impossible to resolve? They are masterpieces that deal with the psychological and will (hopefully) deeply move you. They also feature some of the greatest villains in all of anime (in my opinion, obviously). 
Both feature a heavy psychological aspect in their story and involve police as well as a mystery. 
They are two of my favorite series by far. In both stories, the two main characters are similar in many ways, they are opposing each other, one is good, one is evil. They are both masterminds and are trying to outwit the other and are hunting each other, both trying to come out on top. The characters are flipped tho, in Death Note, the main character is evil and in Monster he's good. The story has some similarities too, like mind games, similar psychology, similar supporting characters, and there is murder and investigation in both.Monster has a little slow start compared to Death Note, but when you get to the meat of it, you can really see the similarities.I really hope you check the other out, as I think if you enjoyed one, you most certainly will enjoy the other. read more 
Both anime series', including the manga, revolve around the themes and concepts of death -- at opposite ends of the discussion. Death Note plays ""devil's advocate"" with the concept of vigilantism and how power reveals one's true self. With Monster, it deals with the responsibility of saving the life of someone who could / may be an ultimately evil individual and how that person see's murder as the answer. 
-Both are somewhat realistic tv series that deal with themes of morality and evil.-Both feature dark thematic themes, and have overall dark tones.Monster is longer and has a slower pace than Death Note 
Both shows are psychological thriller with highly intelligent characters and intriguing villains. 
Monster is Intellectually challenging. It deals with deep philosophical and psychological questions. The main antagonist's personality resemples Light's in certain ways. 
If you had a feeling that Death Note was a masterpiece you should check Monster as soon as possible. Both anime stand out when it comes to mistery and thrilling events. In Monster there are only two different ideologies: one that every single human can be trash, two, that every human has something good inside. Both anime has strong ideologies that exploits human behaviour and they can definetly keep you in your chair watching and wondering what could happen next. 
Both Light Yagami( Evil Antagonist ) and Johan liebert ( Protagonist ) can predict what happen next. They are very smartest character. 
Both are psychological thriller and suspense. Both share the common theme of Justice. The only difference is that Death Note is more supernatural while Monster is total real. If you like Monster, then surely you'll like Death Note, vice-versa.  I give them 10/10! True Masterpieces! 
Both deal with the morality of killing.Their plots both revolve around two entities who are opposite in morals.They both focus on Nihilism. Monster focuses on Nihilism within the main antagonist while Death Note focuses on the meaninglessness of justice and validity.  
Both the series belong to the same genre of psychological thrillers.Both the series have an amazing stories and characters.Both the series have some of the best villains in anime in 'Light Yagami' and 'Johan Leibert'Both the series have been created by the same studio 'Madhouse'.I can assure you if you enjoyed one you are going to love the other as well. 
Same thrill,suspense in both the series.While in Monster there is wider cast of characters.Sense of justice,what is right or wrong? both series ask these questions  
Both shows have the best villains I've seen in a show and also a good counter protagonist. In Death Note you have L chasing down Kira and in Monster it's Tenma chasing down Johan. The only major difference I can think of is in Monster there are no supernatural forces like there is in Death Note.  
If you enjoyed the dark themes and atmosphere of Death Note as well as the philosophical questions brought forward of what is right and wrong, you will enjoy Monster. It is a smart anime with a lot of twists and turns just like Death Note and has a detective that rivals that of L. The endings are also both quite unsatisfying until you look deeper into them.  
Detective chase, psychopathic villain 
Both are great shows that revolve around 2 of the main characters which try to 1-up each other. Both shows are also psychological in their own way, Death Note covering the more 'Battle of Wits' type of psychology while Monster focuses more on human emotions and actions. "
19,13601,14,"Both Monster and Psycho-Pass are psychological mystery thrillers were the main male protagonist is after a ghost murder. No one believes in the existence of mastermind serial killer until late. The lead killers both kill as a third party using others to do their dirty work for excitement excitement. Furthermore they see nothing wrong in their ways are are in essence pure heart-ed but evil in soul. You can judge them by their presence.  
Uncommon seinen anime in detective genre with dark mysterous atmosphere. Characters are interesting and psychologically realistic. Protagonist is forced to make difficult choices that are beyond good and evil. In both anime there is an antogonist who tries to fulfil his vile plans and fights either with the main character or with entire society itself. 
Psycho-Pass and Monster both ask and present difficult questions to their viewers and reward them through effortless storytelling and admirable characters. The rules and expectations of society, the darkness that resides inside of humans, the unpredictability of individuals, the corrupt nature of those that lead the masses—all of these are brought to the forefront of these anime and are intriguingly approached through intellectual plots.Situation and history, action and result, no matter how I looked at it, I could not personally decide whether or not either side was ever truly right or wrong. That thin line between the two is my favorite kind of conclusion. At the end of both stories, I found myself admiring the antagonists and protagonists equally; the development of such brilliant characters to challenge each other is nothing short of amazing.Whether you've seen Monster or Psycho-Pass, I greatly recommend both to you. Monster used a much longer series to mesmerize its watchers (and I loved that they did), but the brevity that Psycho-Pass employed is breathtaking in its own right. Do consider both of these series, and join me in questioning just what it is that you believe in. Thank you. read more 
1- Both plots contains Psychopath - no Conscience and very intelligent puppet master.2- Each episode reveals more background story of the main characters.3- Well written and interesting to watch. 
The main malefactors seem alike, IMHO. They both have a global plan and ruin a lot of lives without any doubts. They both prefer to play with people's psychology. I hate both Johan and Makishima.Both series are also serious, clever and for adults only.  
Both of them are police/mystery/psychological anime and are about a chase against a mastermind sociopath. Both of them have an antagonist that has the goal to chance their society and the MC's point of view on it. Both of them are about an MC that is rejected by society but still fights to protect it. 
  Both of these shows involve catching a very smart and charismatic criminal. Both shows also delve into big societal issues and the underlying shortcomings of human nature. Psycho-Pass is much faster paced overall, and has more action, while Monster progresses slowly and likes to focus on its many side characters and side stories, with huge payoffs later on. Both shows also have terrific voice acting (both sub and dub) and extremely well-written dialogue. 
The antagonists of both these shows are highly charismatic and manipulative.  
Both shows have a really similar feel with a ""ghost antagonist"" being hunted down. 
Monster explored human nature and the identity of evil. Psycho Pass explores similar themes in a dystopian setting where the government prevent crimes by calculating the mental state of its citizens. If you enjoyed the psychological aspect of Monster but wanted more action, then Psycho Pass is a must watch.  
if youre mainly looking for anime with psychopaths being the main antagonist then monster and psychopass are similar. both anime have a revenge plot as well. 
-Both Monster and PP are psychological thriller detective anime. -Perhaps the most similar thing about these two shows are the main antagonists, Makishima and Johan. Both of these antagonists are extremely well-written, they're both charismatic. You can't help but admire these antagonists.-They both delve into human society, albeit Monster has a more realistic approach to it because PP is taken place in the future.All in all, both of these shows are very similar, however, Monster is more dialogue-heavy and longer than PP, it's also slower paced. PP in the other hand is more action-oriented and is faster paced. Either way, both of these shows are amazing, and I hope you'll enjoy them. read more 
If you like the mystery elements of psycho pass then you might like monster.  Compared to Psycho pass, monster follows a realistic approach (set during the 1980s) and follow a young man trying to prove himself not guilty of a crime he did not commit. Also the main antagonist in monster is as good (if not better) as the one in psycho pass.  Also keep in mind that the animation for monster is a bit old since it was produced during the early 2000's.  
Both of them has a very similar dark tone, theme, and story. Each of the villain is the greatest villain in the genre with great backstory and motives. Monster tend to focus on the more realistic side of the story while Psycho Pass approach is through futuristic cyberpunk technology. Both of them discuss the issue of justice and truth, which is uncertain "
19,820,9,"Both these shows are slow maticulous epics who focus on a large cast of characters from all angles without having to resort to predicably stale plot twists to grab the viewers attention. These are definitely more adult shows intellectually. The themes involved are drastically different but very much compatible, if you like Legend of the Galactic Heroes for its pace and storytelling rather than it's sci-fi you should be able to enjoy Monster's steady psychological development. Kenzou Tenma and Johan Liebert leave just as much impact as Yang Wenli and Reinhard von Lohengramm. 
While the themes are different, both are phenomenal at their ways of storytelling and are among the most intellectual shows i have ever seen. Both series also include a large cast of well developed characters. Both are Seinens. 
Both are clever, both have much about human psychology and heavy ethic questions 
Both are masterpieces with incredibly well written dialogue, realistic characters and really good stories.Both are rather slow paced.They are also both for a mature audience and have a similar feeling to them. 
Both series have great character development, drama, mystery. 
If you like epic story with great characters, you should watch these shows. They're different in setting, but definitely share a lot of similar plot elements and character study. 
Both have very interesting and unique concept. Both have heavy (but interesting) dialogue that your average viewer can't take. Lastly, both are MASTERPIECES. They have flaws but that doesnt stop them to be masterpieces. I just wish that Monster would enter the Top 10, or Top 20 would do. 
They have mature atmosphere, with longer complexer story, containing drama and crime elements. They resemble more to an American series than to animes. 
Both anime tells the story through multiple perspectives to drive the plot. Both require decent levels of iq to appreciate for what they are. Both have very dark themes and make you question your morality. On most of the anime lists I have seen, if you put Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu as a 10, you also put monster as a 10. Both these animes are absolute masterpieces and deserve to be watched.  "
19,33,9,"""That which does not kill us makes us stronger."" Friedrich NietzcheWhy are humans at the epitome of all biodiversity? We have the ability to think, we have the ability to reflect, we have the ability to dream. How about Miura's Berserk and Urasawa's Monster?Alhough dissimilar in plot content wise and settings wise, both Berserk and Monster attempted, and did portray: Human nature. Griffith, a power-hungry, though passionate sociopath, rises up the ranks through cunning and despicable ways, concealed by his charisma and charm. Johan, driven by his lust of power and control over humans, has emerged out of the horrors of living hell to become a monster. Both ""antagonists"" are extremely charismatic, manipulative, decisive, unrelenting and ""seductive"" individuals; they are willing to discard and sacrifice everything in order to achieve their goals. However, both shows feature a different perspective to that end, portraying a sympathetic view to both ""adversaries"". Ironically, both titles feature a unique twist of fate to that end, at the same time.At first glance, Guts and Doctor Tenma look so unalike in physique that one may even say that they live in different planets. Yet, there is a striking resemblance between the two protagonists. Dr. Tenma Kenzo, a talented neurosurgeon working in West Germany, made the greatest ""mistake"" in life by reviving a 'monster', and sought to clear up his sin by eliminating it once and for all. Whereas for Guts, his appearance in the Band of the Hawk became the definitive factor of Griffith's ambition, and Guts' realisation became his resolution to defeat Griffith once and for all.And yes, there is a sad story behind the distinct titles and genres for both series. The pace and the development of the plots slowly surface the ""truth"", similar in Monster and Berserk alike.One cannot help but find these titles similar, when recalled upon. Given the  episode count that may frighten off people before watching it, don't. 74 episodes of Monster is totally worth it when retelling Urasawa's Monster novel. Similarly, despite being a heavily condensed series, Berserk outshines many Anime titles out there by not just simply being a ""Gar"" show, but has its fair share of drama, and even suspense. Watch them both. Nobody regrets it. read more 
The stories are totally different, but if you look at it from Johan's or Griffith's point of view, they are quite similar. They are both pretty dark but very sad too at times.  
Both animes have:A: a seemingly perfect character (Johan or Griffith) who is in fact not as flawless as it looks like.B: another main character (Dr. Tenma or Guts) who is trying to reveal the true face of this seemingly perfect being.  
It seems far-fetched but it isn´t.The plot and the setting are nothing alike but the true themes of them both are quite similar. what is Morales? What is wrong and what is right? How does the interacting between human beings affect one another? What does it take to create a monster? And is the monster truly evil or is it a victim of its past and psyche?These are just a few of the big questions both animes ask us viewers.Of course you can watch berserk for the lesser serious themes for its actions and such on but no one can say that berserk isn´t philosophical and tells a story about psychology of the characters.Other similarities:- Both being classic animes and having a realistic art style and they have a quite realistic setting even though berserk of course becomes supernatural.- They are both slow paced and takes its time to slowly unfold the plot in a good way.- Great focus on character interactions and having a lot of other but still important characters, of course monster having the most.- Both Johann and Griffith being quite charismatic and VERY intelligent characters and one does not simply understand their ways, their goal and their point of view of the world. read more 
Different settings, however, both are rather similar. First, both shows delve deeply into human nature, explore it thoroughly. Both shows share similarly charismatic main character (Johan and Griffith). 
Both have some incredible villains, and both of the manga are extremely popular and sought after. They are both character driven, and ALL of the characters are easy to love. Neither are science fiction, and take place in varying levels of the past. Also, for either anime, prepare yourself for the ending. Without saying too much, your mouth will probably be agape by the time you're finished with either anime. Enjoy! 
Although Monster and Berserk do not share a similar setting or even a similar story they both explore human nature and dark themes such as nihilism in an explicit and serious manner. Both shows develop their themes by focusing on two characters and the interactions between them, whether direct or indirect.  
Berserk is a fantastic anime to watch if you liked Monster. While they take place in completely different environments and with different time periods, one can expect to see similarities in the humanized characters, relationships, power dynamics, and complex storyline. Despite its different medieval setting, Berserk offers diverse characters with realistic motivations. Just like Monster, it also has very interesting themes of understanding one’s identity and discovering the complexity of evil. It is one of my favorites and I highly suggest it for fans of Monster. *Be warned that there are major spoilers for this show on the internet, so don’t go looking up too much information beforehand.* read more 
Although Berserk and Monster are totally different when it comes to world setting, but when we look deeper through the anime, Berserk and Monster HAS some simillarities, which is they're both capable to represent the darkest fantasy and reality possible to happen.Maybe Guts and Dr Tenma are quite diffrent personality wise, but when we look at the antagonist on each animes, Johan and Griffith are strikingly simillar. They have a pleasant face for such a evil guy. They also have extreme charisma and extremely manipulative towards any people that they met.Not to mention, Berserk and Monster are heavily talks about moral gray and wickedness of society and government as well.To put it simple, if we kept what makes Berserk is awesome (moral gray, character development, etc) and then we remove all of the dark fantasy and supernatural horror elements in Berserk, we can get Monster. read more "
19,6114,6,"Both shows show the darkness that some people can show, but both also show the kindness that people can show.But thats all that is similar.Monster is more mystery while, Rainbow is a calm story about making it through hard times with....MANLY TEARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Gritty, realistic, dark, depressing, but somehow also uplifting. Both of these shows do an excellent job of fleshing out their worlds and characters, and are fantastic period pieces. They show the darkest depths of the human mind, and while they are often very grim and sometimes hard to stomach, they also have a softer, light side that makes you appreciate the characters even more. They both have lots of moral and philosophical questions to ask. They also have similar art styles (both made by Madhouse). 
They are both deep anime more for adults and with a taste of shitty situations shitty world but also a satisfying bright side of life 
Monster and Rainbow both tell dark and dramatic stories but ultimately have uplifting messages of good people doing good things in bad situations. They both have realistic tone and realistic characters, and Rainbow reminded me very much of Monster in this regard. The characters are excellent, and each character has their own perspective in the story similar to how Monster follows the perspective of several main characters. The characters have a depth of humanity to them in each of these series that so few anime attain. Each of these stories are about completely different scenarios, one an non-linear crime thriller, the other a prison drama, but the tone, realism, and quality of the story and characters reach a certain note that made me appreciate Rainbow in many of the ways that I appreciated Monster. read more 
Story wise, they're very far apart, but both shows have a dark and gritty atmosphere, and both delve into the darker side of life and the human condition. The stories told in each are mature and intelligent, and the cast of characters are very strongly written and well-developed for the most part.  
Story-wise, both of these shows aren't that similar. Monster is a psychological crime drama while Rainbow is a show of a group of inmates trying to live a regular life outside of prison. However they are both gritty, realistic, and some-what calming.-Both of these shows have a large array of amazing characters who get substantial amounts of character-development. Not only that, but they both shows perspective on several characters throughout the anime, making each and every character memorable.-Both show that the world is filled with jerks, but also kind people.Both shows are similar to each other in terms of character writing and portraying how people are realistically. Monster is much more longer than Rainbow, but nonetheless they're both spectacular shows.  read more "
19,3002,5,"Both series put their main characters in psychologically distressing situations, and both of them are about their characters rising above the challenges and owning their fates. Plus, lots of man tears... 
Both are psychological thrillers animated by Madhouse about a man fighting for his values in an evil, corrupt world. 
In essence, both series features psychological themes involving the main protagonist in a world of twisted aberrations. It is a cruel world in both series and the main protagonist must play his cards right to make the most out of his life.Both has thriller like endings in many episodes.Madhouse is also involved with both series. 
This comparison might seem a bit weird to some people, but both anime have to do with the quality of the human soul. The decisions the two protagonists have to take are of the same nature: give in to the monster, or hold on to humanity, even if you might gain nothing in return? The feeling each anime gives is not quite that similar, but the message both shows are trying to get through is the same. I believe if one enjoyed either of these two, they will definitely enjoy the other. 
good show that shows the mc get his life upside down or ruined and they work the hardest to turn everything back to normal. "
19,36649,5,"Though it seems like an odd comparison, both are extremely dark, engage heavily in mystery elements and feel like psychological thrillers. Both have some similar thematic morally grey content and feature characters with dark pasts tied to politically-charged conspiracies tetering on the edge of, or jumping over the edge to, insanity, though incorporates these elements in radically different ways.Monster is a lot more atmospheric and slower paced, Banana Fish is much more character and relationship-driven and fast-paced. Both are among my favorites, however, for similar thematic reasons. 
It might not look like it from the start, but both anime touch pretty deep and dark side of society that doesn't really get much attention in mainstream media these days. Big crimes, corruption, conspiracies, few controlling the many. Mafia buying out police and court, experiments with humans, sexual abuse etc. Whilst Monster is deeper and detective type, Banana Fish is more into gangs and revenge, but they both are for mature audience.  
both anime take a place in a foreign country with a japanese getting involved in a mess f mafia and crimes ,both discuss heavy subjects of experimentation on humanboth anime has a well built up mature story    
Similarities:Dark. Psychological. Thriller. Deep character developments. Characters with dark past and mental problems. Bloody and violent scenes. Mature – I don't know why B.F. is tagged shoujo but it is better suited for mature audience. 
Both are dark, psychological and thriller. Both take place in foreign countries, Banana Fish in the USA and Monster in Germany. Both show a dark side of society. While Monster is slow paced, Banana Fish has a faster pace "

19,22535,4,"If you like mature and dark animes like Parasyte, I would suggest Monster. Like Parasyte, it is a great horror and seinen anime. It is a little different than parasyte as it is not about supernatural beings but about a serial killer. Monster is also by Madhouse Studios (the same studio that is making Parasyte). 
Murder! Violence! and Mystery. Both anime contains main character trying to cope with the changing society and trying to resolve the matter on its own hand. Both features, similar setting and deals with the nature of murder and mystery.

Both anime contains main character trying to cope with the changing society and trying to resolve the matter on its own hand.Although there are many differences, they are both great if you enjoy series with good quality and dark undertone. 
Both anime explore the same question - What separates human from monster?Monster does this via a character drama exploring the monster within all of us, as its protagonist chases what he see as the biggest monster of all.While Kiseijuu does this via showing the contrasting differences and hypocritical opinions between humans and the alien parasite, as its central pair continue to grow closer together from a mental state of position. "
19,467,3,"Both shows have really prominent elements of mystery and suspense which keep audiences actively watching and on the edge of their seats! Though one is obviously futuristic and the other set a few decades in the past they share a common allure due to the fact that they're so exciting and intriguing and they keep us guessing at things. They also both include a lot of ethical dilemmas. Generally, they're both just really awesome... :) 
Both stories have short side stories, which are influencing the flow of the story and after a time the connection between everything gets clearer. The antagonist is in both stories very mysterious and the goals are unclear, they also have in common, that they are connected to each sidestory. 
The animation style is the same. The same psychological roller-coaster is given to the viewer. "
19,5114,3,"Both are gorgeous, wonderfully faithful adaptations of their respective manga and are roughly the same length. Human experimentation, fugitives, a mastermind antagonist with a big plan who manipulates those around him, characters seeking revenge, monstrous characters (physically and mentally), a large cast that is continually interconnected throughout the show, deep mysteries being slowly unraveled, and the list goes on. 
Have a large cast, have great villains, has important messages/themes, and has a large setting. Both have main character trying to overcome an obstacle!  
Lots of digging and unfolding, tons of twists, great character development. "
19,13125,2,"A very fair recommendation to make if you've seen one of them.Differences: Different settings and animation styles. Shinsekai yori has a supernatural aspect which lacks completely in Monster. The former is also more focused on a particular set of characters and their utopian society while the latter is more of a detective series and the journey of our protagonist as he unravels the mystery.Similarities: They have mature and solid stories with thought provoking themes engulfed in a very mysterious and remarkable atmosphere. They raise the question of ""who are the monsters"" and leave some aspects with questionable morality for the viewer to interpret. I also think they are very story driven which leaves some characters less developed than one might've wished for. Both very well scripted and with practically none fan service or comedy relief.For the most part they are both well paced (althought Monster could have probably been shorten) and definitely must sees for those who enjoy good mystery books. read more 
Both are psychological thrillers with themes of morality and ethics.  "
19,437,2,"I'm surprised no one has made this recommendation yet considering the fact that they both somewhat revolve around a serial killer, though in Perfect Blue the MC is being stalked while in Monster the main character is looking for the killer.Both of these can be quite thrilling and can often play with your head thus leaving you mind fucked.If you love psychological thrillers, then either one of these will be right up your alley and they're both well written, whilst Monster is a bit lengthy. 
Both are gripping psychological thrillers with a compelling main character. You get the same sense of gritty reality from Monster that you get from Perfect Blue, they are based in our world and the events that take place seem as though they could actually happen. With well established villains who have understandable motives which is hard to come across now in anime. I feel as though Monster, much like Perfect Blue, is great for people who aren't too big a fan of action but they still want things relatively fast paced. Also for both their premise dosen't loose its intrigue and for the most part the story keeps you engaged throughout. I thoroughly enjoyed both. read more "

263,2402,8,"Both classic sports animes about the same sport, yet different storywise. 
Of course they are both boxing, but the characters in terms of personalities and fighting styles are totally different. However, the character Sendo Takeshi shares many of Joe's qualities such as his violent past, his entourage consisting of local children, and his fighting style. Just like how Karate Kid and Rocky were partially done by the same staff, you can make some comparisons to here as well. While Ashita no Joe tends to have more of the qualities of the Rocky series, Hajime no Ippo tends to have more of the charms of the Karate Kid series.   
Before Hajime no Ippo there was Ashita no Joe, same theme about boxing and only boxing with a little dash of romance.If you like Hajime no Ippo you will most likely love Ashita no Joe season 1 and 2. 
-Both are about boxing and have some phenomenal and memorable fighting scenes.-Joe tackled darker themes while Ippo was more on the shounen side.-Few settings and characters are somewhat similar.-If you can get through the slow pacing and the old animation of Joe you might actually enjoy it.Probably, not as much as Ippo but still. Joe is still a good classic but, hard to swallow for some people. 
Great tale of young man and his road to becoming a boxing champion, suffering thought hardships on the way but pulling through not only thanks to their willpower, but also thanks to the support and advices from others. Ashita no Joe inspired many sports anime in general, so Hajime no Ippo certainly got inspired by it too. 
- Both shows about boxing- Both characters are naturally gifted in the sport. - They Both rise quickly in their individiual weight class.- There are ups and downs in show, emotionally.- They both grow up in the show. They go from kids to adults. - The shows are different in how the protagonists are different. The protagonist in Ashita no joe is very aggressive and lonely, but has always known what he is good at, fighting. On the other side the protagonist in hajime no ippo is very timid and has always had some family around him, but he had to find out about what he was good at. read more 
Both Hajime no Ippo and Ashita no Joe are amazing animes, both are about boxing and both are a story about someone training to be the best. 
Ashita no Joe is a very old anime about boxing.If you watched Hajime no Ippo and liked the world of boxing, you probably gonna like ashita no joe that has the same elements.Ashita no Joe is maybe less light and funny than Ippo but the story and the characters are good as much as in Ippo.I highly recommend it for people that aren't afraid from an old art. "
263,245,6,"Although the stories are completely different, the style of comedy and animation are quite similar.  
There is a nice balance between comedy and action.Both truely unforgettable. And allthough the action is awesome, and sometimes over the top. They stay realistic. The story lines are also close to reality. Everything you see could have happend in real life.Also, you'll notice while watching the series, that you'll really start to look up to the main character. Especially Onizuka from GTO. That guy will earn your respect for sure. 
The stories of Great Teacher Onizuka and Hajime no Ippo may be different, but the comedy is explosive with its well-presented dialogues. There is significant character development in both series as their perspectives unfolds.Artwork-wise, both series share similarities in their crude drawing that illustrate a sense of masculinity, especially for our main male protagonists. As both series progress, they gain friends, rivals, and admirers based on respect/friendship/relationships.Both series also display realism that can be relatable.  
Great (in a way comparable) main character. Over the top humor but can be emotional when you least expect it.Both story are written really well. 
While the plots of these anime are different, they have quite a few similarities. First off, the art style is quite similar. Secondly, they have the same kind of humor, and emotional scenes when you least expect them. They also have similar action scenes and character development. Finally, they also have character you'll look up to. 
Older shows are just the greatest, are they not? First, Hajime no Ippo & Great Teacher Onizuka both have a VERY similar type of comedy, the type I love & the type that keeps me dying from laughing... Both have a really similar character; Takamura & Onizuka, once you watch both you will know how they're similar, very similar. Overall, both shows are very similar & amazing. "
263,20583,6,"Both are ""real sport"" anime (no powers etc), both have really funny characters and good openings, both make you want to play sports, in both you'll see the main character enjoy their respective sport and grow up with it. The main difference is that in Ippo you'll see professional sport, while Haikyuu!! shows amateur sport. 
Sports? No, majority of people didn't start these for ""sports"", just BECAUSE it's supposed to be 'good', and guess what? It was unexpectedly GOOD. Volleyball & boxing, the difference is so humongous that it's simply silly, yet when watching either of these you get the same vibes, feelings... These two interpret 'training' so well that it's enjoyable, the training buildup is so great, that long training, and finally the opponent that gets a piece of that TRAINING! What a bad phrasing... But, you get me! Hopefully? Both surprise you, both are beyond your expectations... 
Hajime no Ippo and Haikyuu!! explores the theoretical part of their respective sports very well, being able to make you like them. The comedy is quite present in both, and this is due a lot to its extremely charismatic characters. 
These are two of the best sports anime 
In both the anime the main character is a shounen protagonist whose works hard to create a name for himself. even though the story and the plot are different Hajime No Ippo is a fantastic sports anime to watch.  
If you are a new anime fan and only watched Haikyuu as your sports anime then I think you will also like Hajime no Ippo as both are very good sports anime. "
263,185,6,"Similar art style, both about sports, although one is boxing the other is street racing.  Follows the story of shy underachiever, with a unexpected talent for their sport.  Both have romantic side plots and sprinkles of comedy. 
Initial D and Hajime no Ippo explore a competitive atmosphere filled with rivalries, intensity, and respect. Both series explore characters in a concrete way. The main character is an underdog that gets himself involved with powerful adversaries that bring out his natural abilities to test. The two series may appeal to different sports, but they retain the competitive style related to their activities.Plot-wise, both series are easy to follow and involve some strategy. At the same time, within these plots, there are character developments, dynamics, and relationships that are explored in a realistic format. 
Similar in concepts. Both are about sporting and rising to the top against all odds. Hajime No Ippo focuses on Boxing and Initial D on racing. Both involved highly intense action sequences which will get your blood pumping and have you riding on the edge of your seats.Both Ippo and Takumi are similar in personalities and their rise to the top both involved training and spirit. Initial D is not something to be missed.  
Although one is about street racing and the other about boxing, these two pretty much have the same ""aura"" around them. Both protagonists develop a talent for a certain sport through their daily job. Without any intention of being a pro, they end up climbing up the ladder, battling different opponents and ending up loving the sport. Besides that, there's also small details: both Ippo and Takumi only have one parent, both end up falling in love and have flash backs of violence. Also, the great use of music and the intensity is about the same. If you couldn't stop watching Hajime No Ippo, you'll possibly be just as glued to Initial D. read more 
Both shows share a really similar artstyle, which isn't a surprise, since Hajime no Ippo's author is Initial D's author's student. Both shows revolve around incredibly and I mean INCREDIBLY dangerous sports, due to the severe danger the intensity whenever there's action is immense. Chills each time. In both shows the main character has their own romance-life with a decent amount of screentime, having their girlfriend relentlessly worry due to their dangerous sport. 
While the themes are very different, both shows have the exact same atmosphere.Both have an enemy of the week formula and with their over-the-top style it's super entertaining.The protagonists are also similar in a sense. Both are underdogs at the start and become legends after numerous battles. "
263,170,4,"Well you probably wondering how come this two anime's are similar ?The answer is quite simple, in both the main characters are new in the field of the sport they ""playing"", and were they are trying to become one of the best!Also a lot of delinquents action so the figthing is mutual in both anime's :)And must not forget the comedy that is present, it's probably better than in some animes that are focused on only that ! :) 
they both start from zero and  learn technic`s and fight their way to top,,,they both funny with original staff,,,the both of them is one of best anime history :D 
Both of animes talk about sports(Hajime = boxing, slam dunk = basketball) and has a main character that joins their respective sports and evolve during the animation. 
Both are shounen anime that focus on sports: Slam Dunk is about basketball, while Hajime no Ippo is about boxing. They are character-driven stories, which create similar moods: both have a lot of funny scenes and intense matches. Also, many characters in these anime have similar personalities (and some of them are even delinquents). "

263,3002,4,"Tense as hell, adrenaline-pumping,  and manly tears-inducing.People pitted against each other. Same studio.Everything else is pretty much different - Kaiji is psychological and Ippo is raw power - but you should give the other a try if you're looking for something addicting. 
Both of these shows are over the top, intense shows about overcoming odds and facing adversity. While Kaiji does take a more calculated route than Ippo who often just gets into his zone, they both are giving it their all in high-stakes situations that last a long span of episodes.Both also make me want to scream a whole bunch because of how insanely tense everything is. 
Kaiji and Ippo are two very different shows, but are similar in a few important ways.-The soundtracks for both shows are phenomenal (Hideki Taniuchi worked on the soundtrack for Kaiji and the opening songs for Ippo)-Both shows show the psychological parts of their respective genres, boxing and extreme gambling. Kaiji and Ippo both overcome challenges through past experiences and their knowledge.-Both shows have unique art styles and are produced by the same studio.-Both shows are guaranteed to keep you at the edge of your seat despite their differences 
Both are extremely exciting shows with expressive artstyles and many emotional ""working through pain"" moments. They also feature strong psychological elements and very over the top visual metaphors for their otherwise mundane ""battles"". "
263,627,3,"Enjoy watching people play a sport and get better and better at it? Hajime no Ippo and Major (all seasons) both give you exactly this.While Goro (Major) is more on the ""genius"" side, and Ippo is more on the ""hard working"" side, they both strive toward their goals with  extreme passion. If you enjoyed one, you'll definitely enjoy the other. 
If you enjoy sports anime, this will be a good watch. Similarly, both have characters ""grow"" throughout their careers and depicts their fight against stronger opponents and how they manage to overcome them.Major covers baseball, which has more aspects to work with as compared to boxing, due to teams being involved. This also means more characters to develop (although HnI does develop its other characters too) and a heavy focus on teamwork. 
A story about the pursuit of a dream, overcoming difficulties, preserving oneself. "
263,22135,2,"Both Ping Pong and Hajime no Ippo are anime based on sports, with Ping Pong being about table tennis and Hajime no Ippo being about boxing. What makes these two anime similar is the character development: both Ping Pong and Hajime no Ippo focus on several character, all with unique personalities and skills. Both focus on exploring the motivations these characters have for practicing these sports. Ping Pong and Hajime no Ippo also deal with similar themes, like for example: talent vs effort etc. 
Each character matters and has a part in the storyline. -Animation style can be extremely off putting- "
263,918,2,"I know what you are thinking:What does boxing anime have in common with a sci-fi samurai comedy? Well to be perfectly honest, almost nothing. If you enjoy each for their story, then this recommendation isn't for you.Now with that out of the way, the reason I recommend these titles together is because they have the same foundation; and that foundation is toilet humor. If you enjoy the perverted jokes that are very present in Ippo, then you will love Gintama, because each episode is about 18~ minutes of that. 
These are the first two anime I would recommend if you have a lot of patience and a sense of humor. Ippo and Gintama both get the ""group of good friends"" dynamic more right than just about any other anime I know, so if you don't mind an anime that likes to have fun instead of always getting to the point, you might want to try one or the other. "

Let me start by saying that I couldn't care less about either of the two sports portrayed in these shows; Boxing and Baseball. However, I WILL watch the hell out these two shows about these two sports. Although Ippo is more about working extremely hard to achieve your goals, learning life lessons, and getting punched in the face constantly, while One Outs is like watching a baseball chess match, all while learning obscure rules, strategies, and facts pertaining to baseball. They both have an addictive quality that caused me to sit around on my days off, feverishly watching shows about sports that I find boring. I even started doing pushups, situps, etc. while watching these shows because they have an extremely positive messages and for some reasonthey just inspire me to work harder.I'm not a huge anime fan, by a long stretch (although, my MAL list beg to differ), but I've never had cartoons impact me the way these have.

Both series have a simple but meaningful story about pursuing goals and overcoming trials featuring very realistic characters with very realistic motivations set in the real world. And if this helps, both are very simplistic and comedic in style with great execution: no overly idealistic deep dialogues, no unnecessary complexities of any sorts, no moe, no fanservice, no edginess or whatever that plagues today's industry. So if you're someone who appreciates anime on a personal level or just wants a refreshing experience, pick up one or both.

Both anime feature children that have to go through some bad circumstances while they explore the world around them (In The Promised Neverland they have to, in Made in Abyss they want to).  
Both focus on young children characters but have a darker tone to the show despite the cute characters. Both have these cute children juxtaposed with a dark & unforgiving world.Both have the main characters struggle to survive in a extremely hostile environment.  
Both The Promised Neverland and Made in Abyss look seemingly ""cute"" and rather lighthearted at first glance. Yet later on in the journey, you realize it's more than that - the world in which they live in are more mysterious and there's more to this than meets the eye. I absolutely LOVE both shows because of the world building, but also because of the ride you are brought on. Each episode, the audience are learning more alongside the characters.  
Both have young protagonists facing against dark and dangerous situations. The odds are seemingly against them but they press on. The female main characters are also portrayed as smart, capable, and determined. 
When I watched Made In Abyss in 2017, I found that this anime had a lot of similarities to The Promised Neverland.First, the characters. Both anime focused on a group of kids who lived in an orphanage. Living in a limited area (as the adults prohibited them to go to certain places) made them wonder, how does it feel to be outside.Next, the design. Both anime have cute character designs that if you recommend it to someone who just watched anime (or someone who only watches specific genres), they would probably answer ""Sorry, I'm not into childish anime"". Nonetheless, both anime have astonishing art.And the last is the story. Even though the character design is cute, but the story isn't cute at all. The atmosphere turned dark pretty quick. The outside world is not as nice as they think it could be. They have to fight and run from terrifying creatures in order to survive. read more 
Both are mysteries about orphaned children who explore and discover horrible secrets about the worlds they live in. Both shows are pretty dark. In both shows, this tone is contrasted by the presence of an optimistic and driven female protagonist. They are both excellent, high-quality stories with great world-building. 
They both have similar themes, and can turn dark really fast. Both have small twists in their stories in unexpected directions. Both have several main characters that are children and that the story revolves around. Both are high quality! 
With Made in Abyss being one of my favourite anime's of all time, with in the first minute of watching The Promised Neverland it instantly made me think of this show and their similarities.They are both based on orphan children and the mysteries of their world, yearning to explore and learn more about what there is to the unseen eye. They both start off rather sweet and innocent and turn to a dark chilling atmosphere. You are constantly gripping on and wishing the best for these children with high hopes of getting on with their journeys. They are fragile and innocent characters who are naive and have a lot to learn which makes them facing these hard and terrifying tasks all the more emotional.Both leave you with the feeling of wanting to see the mysteries behind their worlds and rooting for the characters success as they face the many dangers. Both are very dark and emotional and have scenes that leave you with goosebumps, highly recommended. read more 
The adventure starts when  main protagonists decide they need to see what outside (or ""inside"" in the case of Made in Abyss).  Both have unique kid characters designs  and are initially set in orphanages. Escaping turns difficult because it´s forbidden by adults. The art  in the manga depict fantastic settings and atmosphere and this is properly adapted in both anime. The story will lead kids into an adventure that, unfortunatly, hold the possibility of damaging their physical integrity.  
Both are about adorable looking orphans finding themselves in unfortunate circumstances. 
It's a story about children going through dangerous encounters. Just like in Yakusoku no Neverland, this serie is an adventure with a dark tone to it. 
Surviving in a world full of danger and the unknown. 
Both are emotional and action-packed stories set in alternate fantasy universes about kids living happy, comfortable lives who learn dark secrets about their world, and go on an adventure to uncover the truth. 
Both stories are centred around kids and get better and more intense as they progress. Both have a really nice plot! 
Cute children in a mysterious world that only gets darker and harder to live in. This is the thing that anime does best. A kawaii veneer over a tragic world. 
If you've seen Made in Abyss, you might recognize the heavy tension that perpetually hangs over the series and the degree of mystery that surrounds it. I think the same can be said for Yakusoku no Neverland, as you are never truly sure of what lies beyond the ""farm"" that the children live on, which is similar because in Made in Abyss it's unclear what creatures and challenges lie further in the abyss. The main characters in both series also have lost their parents and live in some sort of orphanage, although in Yakusoku no Neverland the orphanage or ""farm"" is the main setting for the first season while Made in Abyss the orphanage is only briefly present as the abyss is obviously the main setting.  read more 
 - Seemingly cute, but turn out to be pretty dark - Cast of little kids from orphanage - Mysterious world that gets revealed piece by piece 
In both shows, little kids try to overcome something much much bigger than them. 
-both have smart MC kids that are faced with dangerous situations-very unique stories with great world-building. -unlike the cute characters or ed, it turns out to be pretty dark 
-Good Horror-Orphanage protagonists-Mystery world vibe-Temporary happiness-Thrilling experiences 
They want to find out things outside where they currently are from things they heard or saw.Have a purpose, becomes very dark at some bits.Fun but deep at the same time. 
Journey along hope as characters in both titles prevail over overwhelming odds and absolute evil.Both also involve small children that have more survivability and brain cells compared to your average adult that its almost completely unbelievable! 
Both deals with really young protagonists who faces really messed up scenarios 
Probably the closest in the sense that the protagonists are orphans with a dark and perilous journey ahead of them. The difference there being that in Made in Abyss they are moving toward the danger whereas in Promised Neverland, they are trying to escape it.I'd recommend this show mainly because it captures that tense feeling of insurmountable odds being stacked against the main leads, a lot of the time you are wondering if giving up might be the less painful option, whereas continuing with the quest may not be for the best. The evil in either show seems to be the world itself and how life simply is. They will both leave you with the feeling of anguish but also with hope. Both beautifully written and animated. I would honestly recommend either show to anyone regardless of similarities to each other or other popular anime's. read more 
They both look childish from the outside but yet the setting is very dark. 
Both are dark anime, and have children being hurt bad 
Both have excellent stories; Thrilling and suspenseful plot twists; The main cast is comprised of children; The art styles are unique; animation quality is very good for both; and both provide tons of entertainment and excitement that make you want to watch more. 
Both are dark thrillers featuring young children and have a survival element to them. There's also a sense that you don't quite know the full picture of the world in both stories (what's at the bottom of the abyss/what's outside grace field house?), which got me hooked! 
Yakusoku no Neverland and Made in Abyss Both HaveAn orphanage as a settingChildren as the protagonists Main characters who witness the brutally of their fictional worlds A sharp turn to a very dark environment 
both of them really good, though the promised neverland is closer to the tension and horror part 
These two have a lot in common where the characters have the same backgrounds and they are fighting against the unknown and trying to find out an answer to their curiosities and anxieties. 
These animes have a similar atmosphere. Child main-characters have to overcome dramatic events. Made in Abyss has an original abstract-like environment, the main-characters want to reach the bottom of a mysterious hole, filled with mysterious abstract-like creatures. Yakusoku no Neverland is about clever orphans, who try escaping from their ""home"", as they are only raised here as monster-food. Everyone tries to outsmart the others, their very lives depend on every single move. "

Adventure! The search for the unknown! Made in Abyss is quite similar to Hunter x Hunter given the fact that in both the animes, the main character goes out for adventure with his/her friends. The main character of Made in Abyss, Riko, goes into the abyss in search for her mother, whearas Gon. the main lead of HxH, adventures the vast Hunter world in search for his father. 
Both anime start with the motivation of the protagonist wanting to find his/her parent, who are considered legendary at what they do.These series start in a somewhat light tone but get progressively darker as time passes.Their settings allow for very interesting worldbuilding that makes the viewer want to know more about the world of the characters, giving a fantastic adventure feeling. 
Both have a great narrator.Both are very creative when it comes to creatures and scenery. (Made in Abyss a little more)Both have a duo with interesting chemistry.Both have great story.Both have good fights (Hunter fights are better so far though) 
-Both of them tell us about a child who wants to meet his/her parents. -The main character has an extraordinary curiosity about his/her world. -The main character has a very loyal friend who accompanies his/her adventure. -The job, either Hunter or Cave Raiders, have the same essence-Set in a world of unknown truth. -Has many mysteries that spur our curiosity.-Although both are played by a child, but the story is very worth. 
- Each MC core aspiration is a parent figure that they have never seen before but heard a lot of great things about and use that to improve themselves and conquer all obstacles to one day meet that parent figure- The main characters parent is considered a legend - Both setting are based in a fantasy world where society is run by one thing (like hunters and cave raiders) - Each have dark physiological elements and vibes occasionally throughout both anime- Both M.C are always going aganist what people tell them and doing things that they want to do out of shear curiosity with a overly optimistic outlook on the situations which sometimes makes them seem naive but are not afraid to face the harsh reality of there worlds- Both have a mystery element in each, for example; the vast unknown of the depth below there village and other hunters motive/true nature keeps you guessing-Also each have a ""villian"" that is very creepy in there own certain ways like orzen and hisoka- Both have a taboo scene(s) like hisoka can be seen as a child predator because of his obession with gon and in made in abyss the children are strung up naked when beaten  read more 
ok... the first time i look from made in abyss that similar to HXH is :1. they both anime have 2 person that close.. to each other and to protect  each other... 2. both have parent are having adventure to somewhere and wanted their children to catch them.. their parent well... are quite similar...3. the character in made in abyss like hunter x hunter... they are like rough diamond that need to be polish... and have unique ability that complete each other.. 
Two adventure anime following the paths of two kids as they explore an uncharted world in search for their mysterious parents. The universes are very different but in a way, the main characters and their circumstances are somewhat similar.Gon and Riko share this incredible positivity, determination, and the will to face adversity in order to find the truth about their parents, while Killua and Regu protect them like caring big brothers, build unbreakable bonds of friendship along the way, and overcome their limitations working as a team.The main difference consists in Hunter x Hunter (2011) being a more action and strategic fights oriented anime with a lot of physical development, while Made in Abyss focuses on world-building and the beauty and mystery of its dangerous yet beautiful unexplored world.In general, both manage to balance the cuteness of the characters and beauty of their backgrounds with a cruel and harsh reality that keeps punishing their main characters and presenting physical and psychological obstacles to be overcome in order to unveil the mysteries. read more 
Both have many things in common. A light-hearted adventure protagonized by 12-year-olds (even two characters, Reg and Killua, share voice actress), with dark tones and a bit of gore. The main characters explore different places and become, respectively, Cave Raiders and Hunters in order to meet with a familiar (Riko’s mother and Gon’s father). They’re also accompanied by other characters who have different objectives. Oh, and the antagonists are so likable, too. If you liked one of them, the other one is highly recommended 
The two protagonists of both series (Gon - HxH / Riko - Mia) are looking for their parents with the help of their friends (Killua - HxH / Reg - Mia). Childish at first, but suddenly it starts to get dark. 
A child looking for his parent in a world that looks innocent, but it can be very atmospheric and cruel. Both have an excellent adventure vibe. 
Started as a happy go themed then it turns into a dark story. The blood is also present. The story has some interesting elements. Pretty a good watch. 
>Gon is searching for his father, Riko is searching for his mother, the plot centers around it. Also, Lyza (Riko's mother) and Ging (Gon's Father) have very similar personalities.>At first, both looks childish, but suddenly becomes dark, cruel and ""creepy"".>Perfect pacing and worldbuilding. In both anime, the ""universe"" is a complete mystery to be discovered.>Good characterization for both protagonists, they become more ""human"" as the series progresses.>The way that the ""system"" of Hunters and Cavers works it's a little similar.The only significant difference, is that HxH has a thematic more focused on shounen elements, ""super powers"", ""frenetic/intelligente battles"" and  ""a plot that is separated by arcs""... Made in Abyss, on the other hand, does not have much of it. read more 
- Both have a great feel for adventure- Both have MCs who are generally positive and carefree- MCs of both anime have a parent who they look up to and try to find- Both are not afraid to go into very dark and disturbing territory- Both have an iconic duo who share their hardships 
Deceptively innocent in the beginningFollows 12 y/o protagonistsExcellent Fantasy/adventure seriesGood world-building 
Very similar setting and plot development. At first, both looks an average cliche anime, but suddenly becomes dense and dark with some ""psychological"" elements. A journey into the unknown is not only nakamas and happiness, you will find cruelty and adversities too. Both protagonist have the exact same motivation to  get on a journey. 
hunter x hunter and made in abyss are the only animes that have given me this certain feeling of adventre and the wonder what will happen next. I keep wanting to find more info about both worlds. Made in abyss has amazing visuals and some good  atmosphere. The charrecters seem alive and are all intresting in the same way as hunter x hunter. but yeah my mindless ranting about how good the anime is does not give it justice go watch it. hunter x hunter is one of my all time faivourites and i don't use that word lightly. made  in abyss is my best of 2017 if nothing better comes out and it might even be all time faivourite material for me. and i know im selling it a bit high now but go in with an open mind and  don't expect anything  read more 
Looks childish, but it takes you by surprise... Both MC are childs trying to find their parents; Gon and Killua (HxH) relationship are very similar to Riko and Reg (MiA), the ""Hunters"" and the ""Cavers"" use some similar concepts. Both HxH and MiAbyss are adventure anime that presents an interesting worldbuilding, interesting characters combined with a realistic setting; no ""friendship power"", there's no protagonist trying to be the best, no super villains trying to destroy the world etc. 
-Both MC are trying to find their parents who are very important characters in the world the story is set to.-Both are really great adventure.-Both have 2 child MC.-Both get darker as the story goes on. 
both anime are starting in a light hearted way but then develop an amazing dark plot and the story progresses from a light hearted kids anime to a dark shonen anime. 
Both series follow two young children on their quest into the wider world and becoming a part of their desired profession, for Gon and Killua it's becoming a hunter, learning Nen and finding Gon's father, and for Riko and Reg it's descending into the abyss, finding Rikos mother and learning the origins of Reg.Both series also have a very similar visual and auditorial presentation, with upbeat and forest/tribal inspired music, as well as a lot of natural landscapes and bizarre and imaginative animals.Finally, the two main characters are also fairly similar too, Riko could be likened to the upbeat and optimistic Gon, both of which are searching for their elusive parents, and Reg could be likened to Killua, the calm, levelheaded, combat proficient and occasionally tsundere partner.Of course they also have plenty of differences but if you enjoyed these aspects of HxH then i think you will like Made in Abyss. read more 
The two animes begin by showing a universe full of mysteries and places never explored, with dangerous creatures totally unknown. 
The sense of adventure and wonder and sense of the unkown is shared with HXH 
made in abyss reminds me of hunter x hunter. main character goes on an adventure with the side characters. 
Both the anime are adventure-fantasy type...In HxH, Gon goes on an adventure in search of his father and also wants to fulfill his dreams of becoming a hunter.Similarly, In Made In Abyss, Riko searches her mother and wants to go to the depths of the abyss.....  "
34599,13125,24,"They both have an eerie feel to them. Shinsekai Yori is a lot darker than Made in Abyss although they both have the feeling of a hidden deep story that is unraveled as you go.Both are also coming of age stories that show the world isn't as bright as you think from first impressions.  
They both offer this ""what you think is wrong"" concept.There are way darker things going on beyond what the eye sees and both focus on children. 
Both shows have a cast of young characters who explore a new world with little knowledge of it.The atmosphere is dense and mystifying in each show.Their themes include coming-of-age and Hierarchy in nature. 
Both are very eerie stories about children in a beautiful world full of strange creatures, abilities and objects. With a dark story that has light highlights. Very similar in feel. 
Both shows feature very young protagonists who have an unusual sense of curiosity - although Shinsekai Yori is a coming of age story, which and has more of a dystopian feel. Both open up many questions for the viewer, and the characters strive to discover these secrets along the way. The settings are filled with nature over civilisation, creating a seemingly light atmosphere that has darker undertones (especially Shinsekai Yori) 
These series feature young protagonists in a setting darker than they think that is, with fantastic worldbuilding, slowly finding out answers for all the mysteries and questions that keep appearing along the way. 
Both have unique ways of telling the story and presenting the world. Even though both start nicely, and it's all bright and peaceful at the beginning, once the characters leave the surface (in Made in Abyss' case literally, in Shinsekai yori's case figuratively), and dwelve deeper and deeper, they discover how twisted and horryfing their world is.Both are eerie, have settings that aren't familiar with the viewer and their worlds are explained gradually, as the heroes of the story discover the truth. 
What makes the two anime similar is a deep story that unravels as you proceed with the series and an eerie feeling that something is not quite right with the world the protagonists are living in. While at first, both worlds seem to be bright and cheerful, the protagonists soon discover that things are a little darker than they thought. 
Both shows involve children being put in extremely difficult situations in an attempt to discover how their world truly works. Both juxtapose an atmosphere of bucolic calmness with upsetting subject matter and violence. Both give us strongly drawn characters with clear motives, weaknesses, strengths, and relationships. Both are a strange, dark take on fantasy.Both are spectacular.    
Both anime revolve around kids as they grow and mature in a fantasy world.They share similar art styles and are targeted at the same age group.Shinsekai Yori is slightly more serious and philosophical.Made in Abyss has better adventure aspects. 
Both have:- feeling of dread and constant fear of the unknown as central plot elements- main characters are naive children exploring a dangerous world- supernatural environment without generic fantasy stuff- remnants of an ancient civilization are scattered throughout current world- not afraid to explore sexuality/romance of young characters- tons of mystery and intrigue 
Both series are similar in the sense of everything is not as it seems.  
Both have main characters with high curiosity. As the story progresses, more hidden truths are found. 
Dystopian world for which the main characters are burdened with the passion of wanting to know more about their world. Both hold a psychological tension, and sense of horror that is held throughout the series. 
- Both series take place in Utopian-like worlds with very dark secrets behind them. - Creative and unusual fantasy settings. - Great music in both series.- They share a similar appeal coming from their unique art styles. 
Both have eerie atmospheres and gravitate watchers towards the mystery of a terrifyingly natural world. Both always feel complete and never feel contrived.  
Both have similar worlds with normal humans and mysterious fantasy beasts. While the humans in From the New World have telekinetic powers, the characters in Made in Abyss are normal humans who use artifacts from the Abyss to survive. Neither worlds have modern technology, instead using the unique resources available to them to achieve their goals.They both have strong, intelligent female leads who start as children, and we see them grow as the story progresses. Riko from Made in Abyss stays a 12 year old girl throughout the story but grows emotionally, whereas we actually see Saki progress from childhood through adulthood. Both stories follow honest, innocent characters through brutal hardships in an ultra-realistic way. They both focus on a small group of companions relying on each other to find deeply hidden truths. read more 
Both start out as a normal, post apocalyptic show, but something just feels off about the world. It's only until later in both series that you realize the world shown isn't quite as happy as it may appear. The weirdness is more passive in Made in Abyss, and takes more of a center stage in Shinsekai Yori. And finally, both are superb shows well worth your time. 
-Beautiful setting with great artwork on the environment.-MC is a girl who goes around with a friend and lost his previous friends-Kinda dark story.-Underrated-Cruel world surrounding naïve characters 
I thought I was having a fun adventure and then my heart got broken and now this story won't leave me and I keep thinking about the implications so long after finishing the show. 
Quite eerie, forlorn atmospheric animes, both have an interesting concept and worlds. Brilliant quality.   
Both shows are quite similar:- protagonists are children- shows how the protags grow up (mostly in maturity-sense for MIA)- seems innocent on the outside but becomes really dark afterwards- death is everywhere (plot armour is non-existent)- protagonists don't know much about the world they live in (mysterious world)- worlds are dangerous- really good soundtracks- fantastic artThese two shows are so similar you'll find interest in the other if you like one of them:)have fun 
Both shows have a lore that spanning for years about the world the characters live in.The world setting in both shows is heavily bounded by rules and restrictions by the society.While discovering many hints of the truth of the world the characters explore by breaking the rules the people must faithfully accept in the society.As the times goes by the main characters have to face undesired circumstances and overcome the negative effects by getting help from people they seek help and also giving them some help to repay their good deeds and some of them follow the main character to form a stronger team to cope with the treacherous nature.Both shows starts slow in the first few episodes in order to tell the watchers about the lore and the society the characters live in, in the later episodes the tone of the show become darker and more fast paced with some action scenes.Both shows have well animated fantasy world building that looks awesome.Both shows main selling points are coming from the unraveling of the truth and mysteries the characters explore while advancing the plot. read more 
It's also a fantasy/adventure/drama anime. However, it's less introspective and lacks the depth that Shinsekai Yori has due to its source material being a finished, planned novel. Still a great watch, but won't necessarily scratch the itch following SSY "
34599,35839,9,"While these two anime are about two totally different things, they are also fundamentally very similar. They are both what I would call a true ""adventure"" anime. Where the anime is about setting off on a journey to go somewhere important to them, they are both excellent and highly regarded anime. 
-both is about exploring the unknown. -Made in Abyss is an exploration within an unknown world in the center of the earth with many strange creatures and side effects on the human body as the depth increases as Sora Yori is about an exploration in the coldest place on the Planet and how the journey is made to  Antarctica (very interesting) 
Our protagonist is a young girl who is desperate and determined to go dangerous journey into harsh environment in order to find her missing mother. 
Both Made In Abyss and A Place Further Than the Universe feature young, middle to high school age children and their love for the great beyond. Shirase and Riko are both traveling to harsh lands to find their mothers and make friends and allies along the way. Made In Abyss has a dark tone, violence and some truly heart wrenching moments while A Place Further Than the Universe is lighthearted, more like a Slice of Life show like K-ON. However, if you are captivated by unfamiliar, harsh landscapes and exploring the unknown then you will love both of these shows. 
Typically follows the same format with kids embarking on an adventure to a difficult place with the goal of reuniting with one of the protagonist's love one. The protagonists in both shows experienced being underestimated and challenged before they are able to set out on their journey.Both shows exude a theme of overcoming odds and never giving up on one's dream thus delivering a feeling of inspiration and freedom. If you were captivated by the atmosphere and curiosity of exploring the vast unknown by one of these shows, then chances are you'd probably like the other. Be wary though, that Made in Abyss is darker and heavy whereas Sora Yori is lighthearted. read more 
In every episode, the feeling of emptiness grows bigger since in both animes the MC travels beyond ""possible"" seeking for her mother. Adventure, friendship and relationships, memories of a recent past...The animation is flawless, and it has the ability to move the viewer's kokoro :) 
Both have characters that adventure into unfamiliar worlds while facing obstacles on the way. The art style is also somewhat similar, as the character designs are not stereotypical as you would see in most anime. 
Made in Abyss and A Place Further Than the Universe both follow the story of a young girl leaving home to find her mother, whom she believes to be missing, but whom everyone else believes is dead. Both journeys have the odds stacked against them, but where APFTTU focuses more on character relationships and the intimacy between friends, Made in Abyss focuses on exploration and discovering one's unknown past. 
Adventure-A Longing of being going into the unknown.In A Place Further than the universe, they are going to Antarctica, which is not where casual travellers would go to.In Made in Abyss, there is this abyss of the unknown where it has 'layers' and each of the layers has its ecosystems, flora and fauna.

Both have a mysterious/adventure plot and involve fighting against the unknown. Both had a lot of hype during the year they aired. 
The characters want to uncover the mysteries of their world or nation. In Shingeki, they want to explore the outside world but cannot because of Titans. In Made in Abyss, they want to uncover the bottom of the abyss but it is not an easy task. There are dangers everywhere. They both have also special elite forces to who can handle the dangers. Both story are dark. Don't let the first few episodes of Made in Abyss fool you. It will get darker as you go further to the episodes.

Both animes give me the same sense of wonder and mistery from its world building, joining moments of beauty with tragedy. 
Fantasy settings with the main characters starting out naive and inexperienced, yet grow stronger alongside their friends. Although Made in Abyss does not have a central villain and Houseki no Kuni does, they both share a mystical atmosphere that leaves the viewer intrigued. Furthermore, there is a similar ranking system (Whistles in MiA and Hardness levels in HnK). They both have fantastic soundtracks that pull you into the show.If you're looking for a similar manga, 7 seeds is a fantasy horror manga where a group of children wake up in a post-apocalyptic world, decimated by nature, where they must learn to survive. Both 7 seeds and MiA center around dark themes, although 7 seeds is more mature.  read more 
They both have a similar feel in that they are about a mysterious world which are very harsh to its inhabitants. 
They both start with an adventurous and spirited girl in a mysterious world, of which she later discovers darker parts. Although they both have dark themes and can make you cry at some points, they also both have a lot of lighthearted cuteness and humour. I would say that in Made in Abyss it is mainly the surroundings changing and secrets being uncovered that are the driving force behind the story, while in Houseki no Kuni it is mainly the character development that drives the story. Another big difference is that the style of the visuals is very different, but I personally think they both look beautiful in their own ways. read more 
Both shows have a standout visual presentation and a dense world with a sense of mystery that is rare to find. Made in abyss is more straightforward with its story with more intense drama whereas Houseki no Kuni  is more roundabout and intricate focusing more on cultivating mystery.

As an oversimplification, HnK focuses more on world building while MiA tells a more conventional character driven story but both series have a similar mystery-drama foundation "
34599,164,5,"Made in Abyss has a very ""Ghibli"" feel, with an eerie feeling, and a lush, rich world and deep characters and story. More mysterious than Princess Mononoke but if you like one you should check out the other.  
The environement's details and creatures are very similar.Global vibes are very similar: poetic, but dynamic. 
Similarities: The mysteries of their worlds and the way they explore them in both, from the designs of; the creatures, the environments and even the characters. I mean, San's design obviously helped inspire the design of Nanachi, Ashikaga's curse to Regu's cyborg arms and even Lady Eboshi antagonistic beliefs to Ouzen's own antagonistic beliefs. Even the stories are alike; a tale of a journey to found something/someone (with Mononoke Hime, a cure for Ashikaga's curse and with Made in Abyss, Riko's mother).  
Made in Abyss feels like a Ghibli movie that was written by a sadist. Boasts an Art Director, Osamu Masayuma, who has worked on various Ghibli films too, so the art is just as fantastic and captivating. 
Vivid and detailed natural environment, a setting organic to the plot mixing more down-to-earth elements with supernatural ones. Both anime play around with the more apathetic, dangerous and less softer aspects of nature.Of course, one is a movie another a series, and the character designs of MiA are of the chibi style instead of the realistically proportioned Ghibli ones.  "
34599,5114,4,"Adventure world very original. Both gave two kids trying to find a parent and answers about themselves. There is even a tragic experiment story in both of them. 
Both are fantasy and adventure anime with a strong underlying plot and world, focusing on the fantasy and mysteries of their respective worlds.Both have outstanding storytelling and world building, along with the following similarities:- Both have children as their protagonists- Both of these protagonists are extremely knowledgeable and burdened relative to their age- Both stories start because the protagonist want to help their family, who's in a dangerous and mysterious place- Both stories have their dramatic and somber moments, while being relative lighthearted otherwise 
Instead of just listing in dot points what similar, I'm just going to say one thing.What both these stories have is a similar sense of adventure. Both have a group of characters working towards one goal. Not only are the character from both stories lovable and have in depth backstory, but the adventure it's is fascinating. The worlds they are both set in have lore that is not only explained extremely well but itself is just so damn intriguing. You know the world building is good when you as the audience can imaging thousands of other stories that can be told in the same universe.Any way if all that sounds to vague and doesn't convince you, here's my last point.  After finishing FMA:B, it's always hard to go back to watching other shows without thinking ""This new show it good but...it just didn't have that FEEL FMA:B had"".Well let me tell you...Made In Abyss has that FEEL, and you'll love it. read more

34599,199,3,"Very similar feel in that they both feel like you have stepped into the spirit world. With a lush world of amazing art, and incredible character and strange creatures. You definitely feel transported away in both works. Made in Abyss has a very ""Ghibli"" feel to it too. 
The environement's details and creatures are very similar.The main duo work the same way.Global vibes are very similar: poetic, but dynamic. 
The main character  in both animes is a young girl exploring the world she does not know much about.There are strange creatures in both animes.Both contain beautiful art and animation.And overall both have similar vibe. "
34599,6594,2,"Both anime dictate the adventures of a duo as they wander across the world. Both anime contain some dark moments and explore a concept of self discovery. Katanagatari differs with some action and more dialogue as its duo search the world for the 12 deviant blade and come to new realisations. While Made in Abyss can be seen as a coming of age story for its duo as they descend into the ""Abyss"" and go on to face the challenges and dangers it prevails. So, if your a fan of stories about a wandering pair crossing the world and learning from the challenges they come across, you'll be sure to love both series. read more 
Both have adventurers, one which has the 'brains' and another with the 'brawn'. They both go on the spur of the moment quest that have huge dangers without any regret or hesitation. Katanagatari has more of an OP character, though in both the feelings of mortality is dealt with very similarly, it feels as if they could die at any moment at every step of the journey.The huge dreams of the protagonists appeal the most to me, and the unrelenting dedication along with their naivety.   "
36862,33,1,"Has the same feeling of adventure, and is the only thing that comes close to matching the darkness of Made in Abyss. "
23273,31646,52,"Very similar main characters, facing similar complex and personal problems, in a similar isolated setting, similar messages... I could go on. Enjoy! 
the anime tells a story of a young boy striving towards his goal of being a professional in their own respective field while simultaneously facing other problems in their daily lives. while solving their inner problems, they get stronger and eventually reach their goal (hopefully).graphics-wise, both anime has a similar style. it can be gloomy in times and bright the other. the main character is a boy wearing glasses with a blonde older sister-type support female character. 
both feature young child prodigies with an extreme talent: chess and music. Both are about more than just that talent, as the characters deal with underlying issues within themselves and their relationships with others. 
Both of these anime delve into a deep psychological trauma. Both MCs are known as child prodigies and it is due to a need to avert their eyes to reality. They are both complex stories that touch upon the heart strings with topics of depression and self-acceptance. 
Story of a boy who climbs to the top of his profession. Through with that, he is bounded by a wall created from dark past. 
I can't help but to think about Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso when watching 3-gatsu no Lion.Similar titles aside, both feature the same premise; a prodigy young man's struggles to cope with the depression of losing a loved one. Both series feature a prodigy MC (Rei and Kousei) who are similar in looks and personalities and female figures (Kaori and the Kawamoto siblings) who came inside the MC's life and help them overcome their depression. The MCs also gains many rivals and friends throughout their journey in their career.Even though I found 3-gatsu's tone more consistent and its comedy less forced than Shigatsu, I enjoyed both works and guarantee if you enjoy one of them you'll enjoy the other due to their similarities. read more 
A prodigy with an existential crisis. A lot of gloominess and not strong enough comic relief to wipe it away. 
3-gatsu no Lion and Your lie in April both have a main protagonist who suffers from a depression. They also are good in playing the piano. While the one is more romance oriented and the other slice-of-life, they both share the story of how the protagonist overcomes his depression. 
Main character who has a painful past, who excels in a field (Arima on the piano and Rei at the shogi). He also has many uncertainties about his future and lack of self-confidence.Warm characters around the main character; (Hina, Momo, Akari in 3-Gatsu no Lion and Kaori, Tsubaki in Shigatsu)A wonderful animation with a visual identity for both. (The two animes look slightly alike) 
Both animes are quite , about feels and talents and independence both animes have the main character who is shy , wearing glasses both heroines are blonde , and they look like each otherboth main characters have suffered their parent's death and trying to live independently  
Both shows have a lot in common. They both tell stories of a main character who is a child prodigy and struggling to maintain their title. Their struggles are represented in a similar style and narrative, and yet the overall story is different, so it doesn't feel like you're watching the same show twice. In fact I would go so far as to say March Comes in Like a Lion surpasses Your Lie in April in many ways.TL;DR: If you enjoyed watching Kousei overcoming his past and learning to love life, this show is for you. 
If you're watching this because title similliarity, than you're not watching the wrong show.Both MC has similliar problems, and each anime has their own style of art. 
Similar Art styles 
Both protagonists share a dark past and a remarkable skill. The monologues in each of them often have deep metaphors for life. Introspection, retrospection, and dealing with losses/mourning all are resonating themes in these two.  
Both protagonists struggle living their lives due to their treacherous pasts. They both have people help them develop into becoming better people.Both of the protagonists are proficient in what they play, Rei to Shogi as Arima is to piano.Similar artstyle.Both protagonists have glasses (I ran out of comparisons lol) 
Both feature a protagonist who is struggling with depression because of the death of his loved ones and both main characters have a complicated relationship with their passions (Shigatsu has music, 3-gatsu has shogi), but these passions are not the main focus of the shows. Also, both protagonists meet people who change their lives for the better. They have similar color pallets and realistic characters.March Comes in Like a Lion has more unique visuals and better direction than Your Lie in April due to the very different animation studios and directors. Also YLIA has way more romance (3-gatsu being more of a slice-of-life series), but anyone can feel the similarities while watching one after having seen the other. Both are touching dramas that serves as a memorable experience for fans of the genre. read more 
Both of these series feel similar in their directing and animation styles.While Your Lie in April focuses more on romantic relations, March Comes in Like a Lion focuses more on familial/platonic relations. Both are sure to hit ya right in the kokoro. 
Not only the titles look-a-like, but the feeling you get when watching is fairly similar. Main characters have only one thing they are good and his friends (and other side-characters) will help him get back on his feet. The scenes vary from funny to death serious which makes it very appealing to keep on watching. So If you liked ""Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso"", ""Sangatsu no Lion"" will not disappoint you. 
Both protagonists look like they could be brothers and they have a very similar personality. They both deal with depression and loneliness, but are also gifted with a special talent in their field. Both series have an unique color palette and look very good.  
The main characters are both struggling with depression, they're both genius and can't give up on it. They are both drama/slice of life anime with beautiful unique soundtrack and animations. The plot of the stories revolve around the main character struggle and them learning things from their mistakes and experiences.  
The Art Style is Similar. Both Protagonist are talented, they also look alike with glasses, Both Lacks Confidence and depressed. It also gives you The Your Lie In April Vibes 
A talented prodigy who feels as though they've got nothing else (and also happen to look kinda similar) the stories are pretty different, but they give off a similar vibe - and anyone who loves the first, will definitely love the other - at least, I certainly did! They're emotionally deep, are astonishingly beautiful to watch and will leave a whole in your heart you won't be able to forget. About dealing with past trauma, and the journey to self discovery and finding a way to wake up from that half-life depression. Honestly, they are instant gems, masterpieces, unbelievably refreshing and unique but with unbelievable parallels.Truly, you're missing out if you pass either one up after seeing the first! read more 
Both of the main characters have only 1 thing that they do exceptionally well and want but can't separate it from their lives. 
I find these shows both similar not in the aspect of plot but in character. Both mains, Kousei from Your Lie in April, and Rei from March Comes in Like A Lion both share similar character as they have both had traumatic past life events. This prompts them to be somewhat timid and silent but have thoughts encircling their minds at all times. On top of that, they are both young prodigies in a competitive field (Piano and Shogi respectively). Finally, they share a somewhat similar appearance with glasses, messy black hair, and an always  wavering mouth.Another thing noted is the animation. I find a large resemblance in the styles, especially on the character designs. read more 
Both MCs have mental and social problems due to losing their family member(s). And some characters help them get out of those problems.No ecchi.Both are anime with competition in it.Both arts and musics have the same vibes.EVEN THEIR TITLES HAVE ""GATSU"" IN THEM. 
Both of these series focus on characters who are dealing with depression and the loss of loved ones. Both also follow their character's chosen profession and how they handle these careers at young ages. I recommend this to those who are interested in stories about depression, loss, and perseverance.  
I do think the MCs are very similar and overall they have the same tone to them. 
Both main characters have a special talent (Kousei piano and rei shogi)they both walk through life with the past constantly biting them and both are quite emotional. 
Both the protagonists share some aspects in their lifes, like the absence of their families and confront their past to keep moving on 
The vibe of the two anime are very similar. 
Both of these anime are both similiar and different in a lor of their aspects. Both of these series have a talented teenager as a main character that are good at what they do( shogi and Piano). Both these characters deal with tragic events that had happened in the past. Both these characters seek outside help from people they hardly know for support and both these shows get you right in the feels. They have a competitve aspect too.They're a lot different too! 
Both series' deal with a MC who struggles with personal problems as a result of a loss of family, to which it is through the relationship with the center female (3 in 3-gatsu) that the main character starts to break from his shell 
the main character Arima, kousei is so much like Rei  in how they both see the half empty part of the glass .. how they both feel lonely without  piano - in case of arima - and shogi -in case of Rei -, and how the few people around them make the the biggest effect with the least action the make towards them.both are one of my favorite slice of life animesand if you happen to like one of them, you got to watch the other cause surely you'll like it,too enjoy it :D 
Both series feature protagonists who are young prodigies, who are struggling to overcome depression and a traumatic upbringing. 
Both shows feature a main character who suffers from this inherent, inescapable guilt which they work tirelessly to overcome. Both main characters also look very similar and have a lot of similar character traits in general (even when excluding their main difficulties they face plot-wise). Shigatsu is shorter, but Sangatsu is a true masterpiece. Anyone who enjoyed Shigatsu or who cried should give both seasons of Sangatsu a try, ESPECIALLY season 2 as it is far superior (which is hard to do given that season 1 is already perfection). 
Both Main Characters are almost 100% Similar in their downtrodden Characteristics and their Genious attribute in their own places.Arima is a Piano Genius who has difficulties playing it due to his unrivaled skills and past circumstances.Rei is a Shogi master who has been a Shogi monster but his step sister and brother had pushed him away thus he think that his skills of Shogi is nothing but a Necessary Evil for him.Both hate their Genius abilities but they can't live without Piano/ShogiBoth were kindled by the people and friends around them 
-Both the male MCs are eerily similar, both physically as well as with their past.-As time passes, they both slowly open up and start mending the cracks by forming beautiful relationships with those around them.-Both series capture emotions of the viewer and twine them together as the story progresses. 
Why they should be similar, were you thinking, right?Well, to start both told a story about a shy, confused and little coward boy, who tries to overcame his fears and anxiety. As the story moves on we will see our main character grow, evolve, we’ll see him smile and cry, how he’ll interact with his surrondings and what kind of relationship will born with the other characters; because personally, i believe, that these last ones are the most important and fascinating.I will be straightforward with you, both of them have quite the strong emotional impact, on which i reflected a lot. Both of the stories deal with strong, difficult and heavy themes, things that maybe not everyone have desire do deal with, but i still want to invite you, at least, to try to watch and not discard them immediately.To conclude, i hope i have motivated at least some of you, the only things i can add are that there are some of the best scenary that i remember, the musics are fantastic and there si an extraordinary characters personalization.Thanks for reading this far and goodbye. read more 
Both have similar sort of atmosphere and slice of life story telling involving the mc actually developing and making better relation with other people.  
2 stories about 2 geniuses struggling to overcome their loss in the past, and how they were saved by the people around them. 
- The main characters both deal with trying to find themselves due to their pasts- Both are conveyed in very similar ways- Both have characters where they help them discover themselves- Both are touching, however Your Lie in April is sadder 
A story about getting over the past, which is a reoccurring theme in both series. Both protagonist are naturally gifted and talented, however because of it they are both haunted by the past. Kiriyama suffers from discrimination, while Arima lost his abilities to hear himself. They are both great masterpiece series out of their own perspective series. 
Both the MCs are alike and both anime deal with their problems and I think if you have watched either of them you will like the other. 
They are both stories of despair and passion. The main protagonists have something traumatic happen to them, and this despair begins to overtake and hide their passions 
These slow-burn, drama-heavy anime will keep you coming back for more. Plus, both the main character of each show, Kiriyama of Sangatsu no Lion and Kousei of Your Lie in April look like they could be brothers. While watching Sangatsu no Lion, I couldn't help but be reminded of Your Lie in April. 
Both have the same melancholic, romantic, sad ambience and atmosphere. Really peaceful but a lot of inner turmoil. Both had me crying :( 
March comes in like a lion and Your Lie in April are both amazing dramas following an introverted kid with a huge passion and talent in a certain activity. Both of these shows also both have a similar art style which may not be beautiful on their own, but they fit their respective anime all too well. And finally I need to mention that both of these anime are extremely sad, which is to be expected from dramas, but in my opinion the sadness factor in both of these anime is WAY above average. 
Both deal with lots of character development and backstories for each one. goes in-depth to smaller characters and tells their backstory. 
slow paced and have VERY similar premises. 
Both of the main characters lack color and depth within their world. They are now failing at the sports that they were amazing at and both suffer from depression due to lack of family and friends in their world. However, both meet people that manage to bring color back into their world. Sangatsu, overall, does a better job at this than Shigatsu and manages to show amazing scenes along with the struggles that side characters often go through as well. Thus, if you like Shigatsu, consider Sangatsu. 
Both are very slow-paced slice-of-life drama-oriented animes, with a troubled-minded main-character boy (looking almost alike).Your lie in april (Shigatsu wa kimi no uso) focuses on classical music, while 3-gatsu no Lion involves a Japanese board-game (shogi). 
Extremely similar to each other, both serving many parallels that can be identified with the other. Both feature a main character with past trauma involving their respective professions (Pianist, Shogi Player) who gradually develop themselves due to the influence of others. If you are looking for something like Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, this is your go-to series. "
23273,1698,42,"Both animes display some similarities:- Male protagonist is a quiet calm composed person who excels at piano. In NC we have an adult while in Shigatsu we have a teenager. They have similar personalities and yet even though NC is targeted to an older audience it is Shigatsu which displays the protagonist with a much more dramatic past and more dramatic plot. - Female protagonist is rather unique and loves to play joyfully her piano/violin. Personally I find NC's heroine a refreshing heroine because she is very centered in comedy and it is very crazy while Shigatsu's heroine delivers more tragic moments.- Heroine ends up inspiring the hero with her bright personality and that in both animes is crucial to the plot.- Hero and heroine end up making a wonderful duet in music and that is essential to the character's development.You'll find slice of life, drama, comedy and romance, so if you liked one you'll probably enjoy the other! read more 
Both focus on music, and prodigal music performers. They also share some genres in common, like some romance, some comedy, some drama, some concurs (music contests) and great classical music. 
I am gonna make this short and simple.  To me Nodame gets the edge because I enjoy comedy more.  But main difference is Nodame has a more lighthearted fun feeling while Shigatsu pulls at the heart.   
Both are touching stories about a love of music, and how life advances.  Both focused heavily on the piano and entering the music world, where you might have been left wanting more, Nodame goes that much further.  Overcoming obstacles, living life, and finding love - truly both are great animes.  Nodame, however - will leave you with less tears. 
- Both are about classical music.- Both involve MCs with polar-opposite personalities.- The male characters are precise musicians while the female characters have a aggressive yet uniquely beautiful playing style.- The girl changes the guy's life.- Both have some nice and entertaining drama.- Both are slow yet great slice of life romance anime.If you loved Nodame Cantabile and felt sad when it ended, then Shigatsu is here to soothe your pain. Absolutely recommended! 
The protagonist has a fellow musician classmate that admires one another.  One is a gifted pianist the other violinist.  They both explore what it means to create great music together and their bond only strengthens as a result.  Both anime have their moments of light humor despite being touching anime. 
Despite the age differences, Nodame Cantabile and Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso shares many similarities. The main male protagonist from both series have a talent in music playing (the piano). Their talents are noticed especially by others including the main female protagonist. Throughout the course of both series, we see character interactions between the two main protagonists who expresses their interests and emotions. There's a decent degree of realism present by the way their characters are fleshed out including their past.Both series has a great deal with focus on music as a prominent theme. Inspiring to fulfill a dream, the plot centers on their goal and what to make of it by their efforts while dealing with their internal struggles.  read more 
both have almost the same sequence of events and the same atmosphere 
- classical music- competition on classical music- good character development- two main leads who excel on their ability (Piano only)- two main leads with ""dark"" past (might as well be called ""internal conflict"")- both have good comedic moments 
> Both have classical music> MCs have a romantic feel for one another.> Protagonists are struggling to succeed with music after the trauma. 
What color? dark and gloomy or green; green hope not envy, the green of nature, spring, youth and the blue of sky and seas. Go and look for your violin; piano.  
The music and art when the music is playing. Both shows have art that show the setting that the musicians/conductor create through their performance. I would say Shigatsu~ is a bit more psychological/drama and a bit less rom-com, although it certainly has rom-com in it. If you were to combine Clannad and Nodame Cantabile, I think you'd have a pretty close approximation to Shigatsu~. 
Both shows about classical music. 
Both anime are music anime with a touch of drama, romance and comedy. Nodame Cantabile has more comedy than Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, while Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso has more drama than Nodame.Both are also based off of their respective manga. They both also have a male lead who plays the piano as their major instrument. Altough both protagonist's situations are quite different.Nodame Cantabile shows the male protagonist dealing with a very quirky woman, who plays the piano beautifully, living next to his apartment.Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso shows the male protagonist dealing with his trauma, and fear of playing piano, due to a breakdown he had during a concert. He meets a woman who plays the violin beautifully, and she helps him get over his traumatic experience. read more 
If you loved Musical Instruments, this might be the perfect anime that you have to watch. It is a comedy, drama and romance that will easily catch your heart. 
Great dramatic romantic love stories which has a great share of romance and music. Both music genres are classical music and loveable characters in general. 
Nodame Cantabile is thae DATABASE for Romance,Music,Comedy and Most of all FEELSSSS!!!!! it is an amazing anime and a must watch before or after this new anime.  
Shigatsu and Nodame are very much alike, here are my reasoning.Both anime have a male protagonist who excels at playing the piano. In the case of Nodame the protagonist can also play the violin at a high level.Nodame is more centered around comedy than shigatsu. Which gives it in my opinion a more light hearted feel. Shigatsu focuses more on the psychological and dark side of being a prodigy where the romantic relationship is introduced and becomes important later on. Nodame on the other hand introduces the romantic side much earlier on and focuses more on the romantic comedy style.Both anime are very much based around the theme of classical music with a focus on piano and piano & violin duo. In both anime the female part takes a big place in the development of both the protagonist and the story. Romance is a theme which both anime are centered around. They both handle this romance theme very well and it is very well intertwined in the story. There is a nice balance of romance / music in both anime.In my opinion, Nodame can be watched casually without focusing too much, while Shigatsu requires more attention from the viewer to completely understand the feeling of the characters and follow the story.I think these two anime will appeal to both romance and music lovers. Either one is worth watching. read more 
Both anime are about classical music and how the main characters have a romantic feel for one another.  
Everyone has to fight their own fights. Everyone struggles for one or other reason. These shows are about struggling musicians with different life circumstances. They play for different reasons and yet they all share an imense passion for music. They have a need to express themselves through music. Shigatsu wa is about letting go of your past and finding joy in your present through music and the people you love.  
Nodame Cantabile and Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso (Your Lie in April)  are music oriented. What's more remarkable is that the anime focuses more in classical music. Both MC also know how to play the piano and violin. Both revolve through music but they are both different in many aspects. If you want to go with an anime that is more humorous and light, go with Nodame. But if you want an anime that can make you cry, or somewhat dramatic, then pick Shigatsu. Nevertheless, Noda and Shigatsu are a masterpiece. Try watching both. You'll not be disappointed. 
Both are primarily about genius music performers and their struggles as musicians. Both are a mix of romance, comedy, general school life, and in general have bright atmospheres throughout the story. Both have piano/violin performances. 
Both are inspirational, touching stories revolving around a couple of classical music performers. They deal with music contests, romance and drama as the characters struggle to overcome their obstacles and find a direction in life. Shigatsu is more dramatic and intense and has dream-like characters that will inspire you, but Nodame is more light-hearted and funny, having characters that are less stereotypical and more realistic.  
*It's about music*It is very funny but it gets a bit dramatic later on 
- Both anime start out with a calm and pretty happy premise, but as the series progresses, they it develops into a deeper story.- Both anime are about music. 
They both revolve around classical music. Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso has a more intense drama than Nodame Cantabile, while Nodame Cantabile is more relaxing.  The characters in both series are well developed and the relation between them is a main topic in each of the series. If you enjoy one of them is highly probable that you will enjoy the other one. 
If you liked shigatsu wa kimi no uso you should watch Nodame cantabile. Nodame cantabile is not so dramatic but it has the same sense , classical music and great characters .  
If you love classical music and romance, you would like both of these shows. They are both about how the power of music and talent brings two almost completely different people (who probably wouldn't have clicked otherwise) together. Nodame is a little more light-hearted and comedic than Your Lie in April, but you'll probably enjoy it as well.  
Both animes deal with music, as well as romance. Although Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso i s a drama tearjerker focused as Nodame Cantabile is more comedy and light-hearted. Both of them also send a message to the viewer and really change your way of seeing things. If you liked Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, you will most likely also enjoy Nodame Cantabile 
Both anime are focused on protagonists struggling to succeed with music and both anime make excellent use of classical music scores. Both anime follow a blossoming love story between two musicians although they have two very different endings. The strength in both anime lies in their ability to make you care about their characters and fall in love with their music. Both anime have the ability to make you cry although for two very different reasons. 
Piano / Classical Music Drama 
Both anime have a strong musical center. Just like Noda, Kaori gets to know the person she loves through classical music. And for this two girls, their main desire is to play side by side with the man they admire.While Nodame Cantabile is mainly a comedy that will have you laughing all the way through, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso is a strong drama that will make you, perhaps, cry a little. Still, both anime are a must watch, specially for those who like music. 
They are similar in terms of:-Deals with classical music genre-Gives you a heart or warm feels-Characters are lovable and struggle in improving their music skills-Nice art styles 
A romantic story about the first pure teenage love and music. 
Both anime are focused on:- classical music as a medium of expressing emotions- a female lead that plays music with feeling, whose musicianship affects male lead- a male lead with a disorder that prevents his progress in music, but is able to overcome with the help of female lead 
If you are looking for another anime about music, I recommend Nodame Cantabile. While not as serious all the time, like Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, it still has that slice-of-life and a little bit of drama.It does add more comedy, which I think is great and really adds to the story, plus it's a good contrast with the more serious main character. The soundtrack and classical music selections are great and are played very well. If you liked Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, I definitely think you'll like Nodame Cantabile. 
If you like music anime and you like romance's then look no further then Nodame cantabile. If you are aiming for the very specific genre of accompanist music romance anime, then this is for you.  
Both series are classical-music themed. Both have animations that are accurate representations of how the instruments are played. While Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso has middle-school level protagonists, Nodame Cantabile has university-level protagonists. 
Both speak of music as the true protagonist of the story. The motivations and relationships between the characters have a direct connection to it. Shigatsu deals with this in a deeper and more emotional way while Nodame has a lighter tone even though it is more realistic about a musician's life and his difficulties. Two great works (I like both, but Shigatsu is awesome) for those who are interested in music, or simply for who enjoy a good story.  
Both shows heavily feature classical music (and classical music competitions) and a developing romance between two similar couples of characters with opposite personalities (Kousei & Kaori, Shinichi & Nodame). Both also feature some degree of drama and comedy, though Nodame Cantabile is ultimately more lighthearted. 
- both shows have music as their main theme- both shows follow a romance between two musicians 
Well, classic music is certainly the main thing that they have in common. The plot is very different as well as the characters, Shigatsu is more dramatic whereas Nodame is kinda a comedy.But since music is the main theme for both, I think you could appreciate them in the same way. The pieces that are played are really beautiful, the animation is superior for Shigatsu, but it is pleasant also for Nodame. Musical competions are present in both of them with all the struggle that may come along. "
23273,4181,36,"Same feels and void. Both have really good character developments for main male MC. Similar kind of lesson too. As a character, i think female MC in Shigatsu is better than Nagisa. And I think that the story progression in Shigatsu is a tad better. I would say Shigatsu is kind of slow but if you enjoyed the pacing of Clannad, then it won't be considered slow. Beautiful soundtracks in Shigatsu also. Another difference is the seriousness in Clannad usually progresses. In Shigatsu it sometimes gets cut off by some gag humour. But when Shigatsu has to be serious, it does it really well.  
It will wreck you emotionally after making you laugh for most of the series. The cast of characters in both series are not groundbreaking, but how they interact to shape the story (and make you laugh) is what  make each anime shine. If you were to combine Clannad and Nodame Cantabile, I think you'd have a pretty close approximation to Shigatsu~. 
Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso and Clannad: After Story are similar in several ways.Both of these series all build up to a point where the events are dramatic and emotional, as this is seen in the transition from the first half to the second half of the series, along with some comedies time to time. As the story progresses, you start to feel strong emotions within both of these series. With the steady pacing, the main characters develop a lot together. 
Stories about love and hardships, both are filled with emotion evoking drama and tragedy. Main characters try to overcome their past as they face many barriers, hurdles, and hardships. With the help of their main love interest, they try their best to open up a new life in their lives.May require some boxes of tissue. *sniff *sniff 
It's easy to draw parallels between Clannad and Shigatsu. In both, there's a protagonist who doesn't really have a direction in life anymore, with a dead mother and a father who neglects him; while the female lead has a terminal illness and parents who run a bakery.When the two meet each other, their view of life changes, similar to Okazaki and Nagisa. However, you could say that Kaori's personality is the polar opposite of Nagisa. Both are great anime with beautiful soundtracks. 
For me, the first episode was lame, although needed for the fast introduction of the characters. Once you are drawn into the story it becames a masterpiece. Your lie in April is a Slow paced anime that has a character development similar to clannad, hosting a MC which is very traumatized about his past, making it difficult for him to move on. For those who didnt reach the message in the beggining, it all becames very clear in the end. This was quite a ride.  
Watching both of them I had similar feeling. They have got funny and very touchy moments 
Both of them are about girls with a strong personalities.Similar Soundtrack which is in harmony with the emotions. 
Both series are emotional rollercoasters that beautifully execute their dramatic narratives and character arcs without going way over the top and becoming a cringe-worthy melodrama (looking at you Anohana) 
- both male MC are greatly developed as the series goes on- both female MC had a strong character supporting both male MC- both female MC had frail body or some kind of illnesses- both series serves kind of Feels Trip- both OST are top notch and match the situations, totally worth to have them in your playlistsomehow Clannad AS often gets more into seriousness, while shigatsu gives a mediocore dose of humour 
Ok, right off the bat, both are beautiful series with sad moments and tear jerking endings. Both series hold a lot of meaning in them and depending on what kind of person you are, these series can really touch your heart. There are really good life lessons that can actually be learned from both of these series. Both anime contain beautiful soundtracks and really good development for its characters, especially its main male characters. While Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso contains more humor than Clannad, it still does the job well of hitting you with feels. I must warn you that if you are one that hates slow pacing, then I highly suggest that you avoid both of these anime as both of them are rather slow paced. However in my opinion, that's the beauty of these two series and if you like the pacing of Clannad, then most likely you'll enjoy the pacing of Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso. Overall, both series deserve a chance and who knows, it could be life-changing for you. But then again, that's just my opinion. (Note: I almost forgot to mention that be sure to watch Clannad before you watch Clannad: After Story as Clannad is a very important prequel before the emotional After Story.) read more 
-Both have the school-theme-Both have lovely characters that u start liking really quickly-Both have a cute love story that unravels the potential of the main characterand...Feels...damm dem feels  
Both anime's pretty much some of the saddest anime's out there.  Your Lie in April is just 25 episode so it is quicker leader up compare to Clannad which is 2 season 40 plus episodes that build up to some of the tear jerky plot.  Both should be watch in dark room with no one around.  
they arent similar at all not even in tags: Clannad :Slice of Life but (your lie in april): is about music both are sweet and good to follow , in my opinion Clannad is a little bit boring Shigatsu is way better its about Music but they both share a sad ending after all its up you guys . Dudera (ClannadS1&S2) 
-Both deal with the main character having to go through losses of people he cares about-In both, the main character is kind of reformed (Tomoya from a delinquent and Kousei from his trauma of playing the piano) by the main heroine-In both, despite being able to predict depressing events, they still are extremely saddening to watch 
Both shows has amazing character development for their male protagonist's.Both shows has amazing soundtrack's.Both shows leaves you with a sad/void feeling.Both shows has pretty slow story progression. 
Clannad After Story and Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso both hit you with the feels hard and often. They both have a lot of comedic moments as well. Both stories are about overcoming barriers in life. Both male MC's develop a lot through the anime with the help of the female MC. Both female MCs are ""out of this world,"" although through different ways, and both help their respect male MCs to see the world differently. Also, both female MCs are fragile and have illness and also have bakery shop owning parents. 
Both are dramas, romance, and sad. Both have compelling stories and great character development. Your Lie In April is far better, the only big difference is that Your Lie in April is very music oriented, but that's about it. 
Really similar in terms of plot and characters, female MC a bit more developed compared to Nagisa, but eh. 
This anime has a very different plot, but gives you the same feelings as Clannad After Story. I loved them both. There are events in each that are very similar too. I think anyone who loved this anime would also love Your Lie in April! 
Both series are masterfully executed, one demonstrating the value of family and the other demonstrating the value of friendship. Out of all the heartbreaking anime I have watched, these two stand as the definitive tearjerkers amongst all the rest. They both contain remarkably strong soundtracks, perhaps the greatest I've ever heard, and outstanding character development of the protagonist. A common theme established in both works of art is the devastation and despair that is accompanied with loneliness, and the conviction that one individual is capable of changing another's ideologies and lifestyle for the better.  
The feels!! Just the huge impact on emotions. I seriously cried a bunch from both xD 
Very similar, both were tear jerking af! Both these shows are master piece belonging to the same genre and their rating justifies that 
Your Lie in April:If you like sad animes then you must watch this one.Genre-Shounen,Romance,Music. 
Both series involve comedy, drama, romance and a story that will tear your heart in two. The characters are relatable and 3D. Whenever there is an upsetting moment in either, I was left distraught mainly because of how the other characters felt and how easy it was to empathise with them. In terms of soundtrack, both are astounding. Both of the openings fit perfectly with the shows and good in their own rights. The OSTs for both are spectacular in their own, unique ways. Clannad involves music that will make the scenes even more of a tear-jerker. Whereas Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso has a many genres of music within the OST, which fits the show.I chose After Story, rather than the original Clannad series, because of the way it makes you cry or at least want to. Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso is very similar in that way.   read more 
In addition to making you cry, this anime brings incredible songs and beautiful drama with a touch of romance. 
Both are very deep and emotional , a must-watch 
Both MC's deal with trauma from their past until one day a girl comes into their lives and seemingly changes them for the better. There's heavily relatable characters whom have to struggle with overcoming their grief. Lastly, both series are just incredibly sad and probably will leave you a mess. 
Both feature the most meaningfully tragic but beautiful stories ever told through captivating animation, characters, and soundtracks.  
I couldn't stop my tear drops after completing this series ... Really , it's a masterpiece. It's pretty similar to "" Your Lie in April "" too based on story processing , love , romance, emotions, school life etc. But remember, if you want to get the complete feelings and emotions of this series , then you have to watch "" Clannad "" first and it's a must to all of you. At last I want  to tell you that , don't even dare to die before watching this series. If you do that, then you will regret for it later and I can give 100% assurance of that to all of you for that. Really, man....I'm in love to this series...!!!!   Best of the luck....Arigato read more 
Both of these anime mainly focuses on the aspect of the distress the world can give you. Basically it gives both of the m.c's the meaning of love, and being love, and being able to deal with the outcome. 
Dealing with unresolved feelings is hard. Whist in Shigatsu there's a lot of emphasis on the ""how"" it's done after the damage has taken place, Clannad (and :After Story) is overall a better journey through the beginning, middle and end. 
You probably came into Clannad: After Story knowing it's sad, well the same goes here. You get some setup to build the relationships between the characters and understand them better, then depression hits. 
They are both immaculate storytelling and tell the story about losing a loved one. Both OSTs are very powerful, as well. 
Both animes are very sad have a very beautiful romance story. 
Both anime start of light-hearted and funny, but as they progress they become a lot more dramatic. By the end you will most likely be an emotional wreck so be careful going into these anime. Both Tomoya (Clannad) and Kousei (YLIA) have no direction in life until they meet Nagisa (Clannad) and Kaori (YLIA) who give them a reason to keep going. It is around the second half of each anime that the tone shifts and they transition from comedy to drama. They are both two of my favourites, Clannad being #1. So if you like one you'll most likely like the other as they share a lot of similarities. Be sure to watch Clannad before Clannad: after story (It is worth the wait). read more "
23273,36098,36,"Similar character developmentEvokes similar emotions 
-The main dynamic between the two leads is extremely similar-Both generally have a carefree and uplifting tone masked by a twinge of sadness, though Shigatsu has lots of moments that do not necessarily have that same tone-Both aim to revolutionize the audience's view of the world and inspire change 
Main boy & girl are complete opposite of each other.Girl live her life to the fullest meanwhile Boy have struggle with social interaction.Story about dealing with misfortune, grief, and growth.Also great love story, without official relationship status. 
Life...is a drag, and having a stable social one is even a bigger drag. Unlike in Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, in Kimi no Suizou wo Tabetai the main character copes with antisociality & school problems, while in Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso the main character copes with other more complex mental barriers, ""main character copes"" that's a little misleading, MAIN CHARACTER gets pushed over his limit by an extroverted female lead that wishes to help the main character, that's how it should be -- while slowly developing feelings for our troubled male protagonists. Both stories are tragic yet beautiful. 
Both are great stories with similar plot lines.  KimiSui follows much of the same plot at first but there's a much different ending.  Both are dramas with romance elements, although the dynamic is different than in YLIA.  Both have an outgoing female lead and an introverted male protagonist.  Everything good about YLIA follows suit in KimiSui. 
Human relationships in general are very hard to handle and understand. These two animes show the real difficulty behind that, they talk about and how a girl, full of happiness and energy, tries to help and get related with an antisocial boy, who does not care about making friends, having new experiences, we could even say that them do not care about life at all. Is she going to make him change? 
A story of two very similar characters but different in their own regards. 
These tear-jerking animes can broaden your view of life and emphasize the importance of living every moment as if t's your last.The heroines struggle with an incurable disease and shows us how they make the most of their residual time with loved ones surrounding them,captivating us in a touching and mesmerizing journey! 
Same kinda story, sick girl meets antisocial guy and their story. Both extremely sad and heart breaking. 
A lot of similarities in relation to the main characters, and the situations they're put in. Main male has a very negative view on everyday life until he meets the main female lead, who tries to make the best out of her terrible situation. Both shows also share similar scenes towards the end  
Both had similar plot and characters. Stories about an ill popular girl becoming friends with an antisocial boy whilst changing the boy's life. 
In the two anime, you have two boys who was living in their own world until a single petal that drifted into their life. Both tells a tale almost similar, yet different in countless ways. They both tells the story of life, death and importance of person in life but presently in a vastly different but admirable way. If you liked one, then you'll mostly likely like the other too~   
And then here we go. You know what i mean because if you've read another user's recommendations then this one's not much different than the other. Ok so here's my thought, instead of telling how is this similiar to each other i'm gonna tell what's different. Because the difference are much less. So the difference is the setting. Just different place, different event, and maybe different behavior between the MC's. But all the other things are same. Like the same damn character, same circumstances, or even same plot. I'm not gonna say the shigatsu one are better or the otherwise. But what i'm gonna say is even with those differences or similiarity, you won't get the exact same feeling from both anime so watch one after the another are worth if you're like it. read more 
Follows similar character suffering with illness that is about to dieAnd another character whom the first one loves secretlyAlso the second one gets affected by first one's thoughts finally redeemed Death and life are portrayed very well 
In both cases there are similar themes but with certain differences that will make you end up loving them and also end up crying. 
Unfortunately, some of the similarities will have to be omitted to avoid spoilers.- Both portray the reality of a more apathetic protagonist, who changes his perspective on life based on involvement with a girl.- Both contain relationships between a practically opposite couple. Sakura and Kaori are really similar in their personalities.- Both moments of final climax are extremely similar (I will let you find out for yourself).- Both carry emotionally impactful messages that are projected on the protagonist, but that are valid for the viewer. In Shigatsu, this is more Character-Focused, while in Kimi no Suizou wo Tabetai, it is more Theme-Focused. 
both feature a main girl who appears to be on a timer. both explore the relationships between characters and how meaningful connections can change a person for the better.  
-Both shows possess a character suffering from an illness.-The bond between the two protagonists get stronger and stronger as time passes.-Both are bittersweet and beautiful in their own way. 
Both have titles that don't make sense unless you watched it till the very end which will be revealed that increase the impact of the story. The cheerful and optimistic girl and the antisocial boy hanging out with their own story and adventure to be remembered as a flashback at the last scenes to bring tears to your eyes. Both reminds you to live your life to the fullest and the importance of appreciating your own existence.The stories started in spring. Where the sakura blossoms in spring. 
Similar plots, yet a different story to tell. 
Both main male characters have personal, social or mental issuesBoth main male characters have to overcome those issues with the help of the love interestThey both teach people to value life and the people you know because life can end at any moment so you have to cherish these moments before they become memories 
Both have very strong feels and both endings are sad. And also both Heroines are cheerful despite their situations 
+ Both involves one of the main characters dealing with a certain illness+ Both of them involve romance and involve high school+ Great animes to watch if you are looking for a good tearjerker I recommend both Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso and Kimi no Suizou wo Tabetai if you want a great high school romance anime with a great storyline. It will make you laugh and cry and also make you smile.  
Same premise of terminal illness and ensuing relationship development between MC and patient. Your Lie in April hits all the same notes (pun intended) as I Want to Eat Your Pancreas, but better. 
It's almost exactly the same thing. I'd personally argue Shigatsu explores the same subjects more/a little better, but what do you expect, one is a series, one is a movie. One is going to have more time and content than the other. To name some comparisons: Both deal with a nerdy/isolated boy getting attached to a girl with serious health problems. How they deal with that is a major factor in both titles. Hiding these health problems also plays a part in both. 
Both are about a tragic love story. Male protagonist of both anime are aloof and and girl who is the female protagonist changes his life. These shows are really sad cant say much about it or it will get spoiled. 
I watched ""Your lie in April"" before watching this. Every detail from starting to the end felt like the same thing. Both anime are amazing having depressed main characters and a (SPOILER ALERT) dying cheerful girl. I really felt the same way after watching this movie like I felt after watching YLIA.  
If you liked how beautifully Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso deals with relationships and the impact some of us can have on others in a short period of time, then you'll definitely love Kimi no Suizou wo Tabetai just as much. Both of them have similar themes and messages, likeable female main characters and relatable male protagonists. With stunning visuals, inspiring character development and an overall great story, this movie will hopefully exceed your expectations.   
Both MCs are guys who appears to be emotionless or unhappy. They then both meet a girl who is very energetic and cheerful. Both girls also have health problems which they try to deal with. Very similar in terms of animation and art style. ""I want to eat your pancreas"" revolves a lot around books, whilst ""Your lie in April"" is more about music. 
The plots are great, and gets very interesting in the later episodes, the character sketches are also op... personally I really loved both of them 
- Both have that one gorgeous female character that changes the MCs life into the better.- Both give similar vibes with the Drama and Romance genre.- They both have a depressing and sad ending.- Both are Tearjerkers.- Both are really good.If u liked one of them u’ll for sure like the other too. 
Basic Plot Outline is kind of similar but if one likes Kimi no Suizou wo Tabetai, the person will absolutely love Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso. 
The theme, elements, the characters' personality, and how the story flows are similar to YLIA. Although the ""Kimi no Suizou wo Tabetai"" is not a genre of music, but when you watch it, you'll remember and have a thought like ""Oh, I remember YLIA. It looks like this."" I'll recommend you after watching the YLIA, watch this movie. I'm sorry if I'm the one who flooded your house. 
I first watched Shigatsu, so when watching I Want to Eat Your Pancreas, and the story unfolded, i noticed the similarities between them:The two of them have similar characters, you can easily notice this in Kaori and Sakura, cheerful waif- i mean girls, with an illness. Its also noticeable in the MCs and i found Kyouko a little comparable to Tsubaki, same with Issei and Watari.Also, one thing i liked about both is how they have a certain small focus on Spring, April and the blooming of Cherry Blossoms, its quite beautiful. Similiar themes and vibeGreat character development as the story progresses, if you didn't like the MCs that much at first, give them a little time.Considered as tear-jerkers by pretty much everyone (and they didn't lie)The fact is, if you liked Shigatsu and watched it first (like me) or vice versa, you will love the other! So, what are you waiting for? Go on and watch them! They are basically look-alikes! read more 
They both have the same message and the two main character in each anime have very similar personalities and developments. 
Quite Similar story plot with unexpected twist packed with heartwarming moments. This is an amazing tearjerker. "
23273,9989,35,"Utilizing similar romance tropes, viewers can expect to find themselves emotionally drawn in by the ups and downs, but a touch of mystery added in. 
The story is set were the characters needs to confront their pasts to face reality and move forward into the future. They are both very emotional and strong stories.and they both are about lose, so its pretty easy to put your self in the Main character's Position and get hit directly by the feel train and even shed a tear ~  
In both anime the cast must confront their pasts to face reality and move forward into the future. 
Both are touching stories about growing up and having to deal with real issues. Both will also rip you apart emotionally. Wonderful soundtracks too. 
This anime is about music and romance. The main character, Arima Kosei, struggles with his life as a middle age student. He was consent with his life, until one day, one girl, Miyazono Kaori, changed everything. I recommend watching this anime if you watched Ano Hana, because the main characters are similar to one another and how they both have someone supporting them. Especially the ending for both animes.   
Your Lie in April is basically Anohana's second coming, having both done by A-1 Pictures and both having the intention of ripping your heart out in pieces. One thing that both shows share is that there is a good portion of the story being about the childhood of the characters, and even the conflict on both shows started in their childhood. But what separates them from each other is Your Lie in April is more on music while Anohana is more on childhood nostalgia.My personal preferences: If you're a person who've watched Your Lie in April first and is going to watch Anohana, I prefer you watch in a minimum of 1 episode per day. Because Anohana is a show that will do everything in it's power to make you cry in every episode it has. Granted, it's shorter (11 episodes) so it's kinda understandable. Some of you might be fine with that but in my own experience, I didn't cry as much as other people did because I watched it in one sitting and when a dramatic scene does come in an episode, I just feel numb because I'm still not over about the dramatic scene in an episode prior. read more 
Friends who develop their friendship.  Some romance involved (slight triangle or square).  A girl who helps a boy to get back into the world.  The boy stopped doing something that used be a part of their daily life.   The girl is very enthusiastic and inspiring.   
The animes are similar in the part of the (SPOILER! DON'T READ) death ambiance that are present in the episodes. You can tell that there's someting that it doens't feel right in the middle of the happiness of the charactersThey are both very emotional and it beat right in the feeling.After all the conflits are settled, you can't understand if there is an happy or a bad ending. You stay happy, but you want to cry. 
- Both made by A-1 Pictures- Both have the same sort of art style and character designs- Jin Aketagawa is the sound director for both anime- Both have Drama aspects in them- Both have likable characters 
Like, you feel the drama right? You wanna feel that your heart need to pump harder because of friendship and some cry, happiness and more. Just chill, you will feel everything so similar from this two animes. Try it out, you will not be regret. 
Both animes will make you end up on tears. You'll fall in love with the characters and their story.

Both will guide you on people trying to overcome a problem that has affected them for a long time. The feels train also takes a stop in both of these anime.  
both have a dramatic and emotional ending . 
Hop aboard the feels train...I swear you will cry buckets at the end of both...Tugs, no...jerks at your heart stringsAll in all, similar themes of living for the present. 
Both are touching, and moves you to appreciate the things you have in life more.  
Did you cry while watching ""The Flower We Saw That Day""? Do you enjoy anime that make you cry? Are you a masochist? So am I. Your Lie in April, just like The Flower We Saw That Day, will make you cry (unless you're a cold heartless bastard). Your Lie in April is the journey a boy makes, with the help of a pretty classmate, to overcome his depression and continue to play piano after his mother/piano teacher passed away from an illness. Similarities between the two anime are: Great Animations/Graphics, music that can make a grown man cry, and a stellar voice acting cast. Even though being short, one season anime (Your Lie in April being longer), they had surprisingly satisfying (and depressing) endings. TL;DR: Watch Your Lie in April. read more 
Both emotional anime with relatable characters. Both awesomely conducted for a bittersweet ending. You'll sure like it. 
These two shows are really touching and sad, and main themes include friendship and romance, as well as coming of age.Both of them also have an interesting cast of characters and beautiful art and music. 
- Both anime revolve around an MC who has trouble letting go of the past.- Both anime attempt to communicate powerful messages with their story.- There is more depth in many characters than what initially meets the eye within both of the shows. 
*Spoiler*Ano Hana is yet another one similar to Shigatsu as in the male protagonist meets someone who's known them from the past and is their first love. 
Love triangle - check.Death of significant someone changing MC's life - check.Plot to rehabilitate one's self - check.Feels - definitely check.Bonus: Both are from the same studio. 
The vibe of the anime is similar, and so is the overall theme of the anime. 
An emotional ride. A character-driven story of overcoming trauma and coming to terms with oneself.  
THEY BOTH RIPPED MY HEART INTO MILLION PIECES.REWATCH IT ALMOST DOZEN OF TIME YET I AM STILL CRYING. 
While their main story is different from each other, their similarity lies in that both have main characters who are burdened with their past as they try to face forward to a better future. Another thing is that you'll be bombarded by a variety of feels as you learn more about the characters and story. There are also the love triangle aspect that brings out drama. 
Both series are absolutely fantastic dramas that feature wonderful characters. If you are looking for a beautiful anime that will bring tears to your eyes like Shigatsu wa Kimi noUso, then this is a perfect choice.  
Both have amazing intro and outro, with the portrayal of each character and their personality. Final episode is said to be the climax where the tittle only make sense after watching it and tears will be dropped, supposedly.Also, both will show you how hidden feelings and emotions can make you feel warm inside and yet to be filled with regrets. It's a play on secrets and drama of a few teenagers with their own story to tell. 
Both the animes are brilliantly executed. I literally cried at the end of both show. But I was more than satisfied with everything shows had to offer. I had a great time watching them. Highly Recommended to every anime lover. 
Its both about characters learning to move with their lives and connecting with someone on borrowed time. 
If you want an emotional ride that will surely make you cry, you can find that in both of these anime. Both these anime tell very touching and heartbreaking stories. Both these shows know how to use music in an effective way to trigger emotion. Being very similar shows is why if you like Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai, I would recommend watching Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso. 
 I would recommend Your lie in April. Why it's because not only this was my first ever anime. This anime will make the person whoever I recommended it to create an attachment with the characters and story to the point that they will have feelings at the end of it. After watching this, they will want to consume more anime to fill in the void that this anime created to them.Not only that, but this anime will teach them the lesson of healthy relationships and live life to the fullest. This is a great anime to start. It has all of the components to make you turn into an anime fan.To the music, characters, and story. This anime will make you hook in to look for more animes. Knowing that these different components make a good anime. read more 
They are both about losing a loved one and trying to find inner peace with each other before they go. Both are pretty hard tearjerkers, too. 
If you like tearing to death with anime, this one is for you. 
Both of these animes are about friendship and dealing with loss. If you watched anohana because you're a fan of animes that will make you sob, then your lie in April should definitely be next on your to-watch list. "
23273,12531,27,"""A famous violinist once said that by exchanging (musical) notes, you get to know one another; to understand one another. As if your souls were connected, and hearts overlapping. It's a conversation through instruments. A miracle that creates harmony. In that moment, music transcends words.""Kids on the Slope has its two MALE leads connect via music. There's every suggestion that the thugish drummer would like to pound more than his drums as they compete and connect by playing jazz together. The glasses-wearing, scrawny lead finds liberation by escaping from the restrictions of classical piano playing and happiness by bonding with his 'friend'. The show does try to mask the homosexual undercurrent with heterosexual romance subplots for both characters, but since music is the main focus, both subplots remain on a road to nowhere. And, fittingly, the male leads end together... in a spiritual sense, at least. It's all too obvious the series was created by a female, both in terms of top/bottom character designs and the actual content.Shigatsu is a far more male-orientated, shounen experience. The piano playing lead in Shigatsu is still very much four-eyed and scrawny, just like the lead in Slope, but his musical performance partner is a beautiful long-haired blonde violinist. The same way jazz liberated the lead in Slope, the heroine in Shigatsu injects life into its male lead by inspiring him with her rock-star style violin playing and energy; prompting him to be her partner. Like Slope, there's also romantic subplots with other characters, but it's crystal clear the musical pairing will later pair up in other, just as passionate ways. Maybe.Also, although it's just a matter of preference, I prefer Shigatsu's shouenish FREAK OUT humour over Slope's more subdued, realistic tone. That's a key difference between the two. Shigatsu presents an inexplicably anime mental block issue over piano playing, yet it's never as depressing as Slope because of the injection of humour. Childish but fun. Also-also: THE MUSICAL PERFORMANCES. A lot of attention was put into them; especially in Slope where an actual person did the drumming motions. And the violin playing in Shigatsu was equally captivating. read more 
Despite the music genre difference (Classical and Jazz), both are set during their high school years and have the recurring theme of the musical arts, romance and drama. Each have a pair of musicians whom they end up meeting in a life changing fate and are quite unorthodox but are able to perfom spectacular music! Love polygons exists in both shows and each character has their own set of life-changing problems and trauma. It's a must watch for those who enjoy the musical arts and drama! 
Both anime display some similarities:- Both are about music: Sakamichi relies on classical and jazz whereas the ost can be wonderfully adapted to the characters feelings and humour. Shigatsu's ost is very calming and more classical but also fits the drama.- Main guy is a megane who is a genius pianist but is uninspired and traumatized until he meets someone who makes him regain his love for music and life. Both are likeable protagonists that were forced to learn music and because of that lost the ability to enjoy it, but actually they love music.- The person who inspires the hero to play again also plays an instrument. In Sakamichi is another boy and in Shigatsu it is a girl. - Friendship is also a main theme where a group of friends tags along and has fun being that crucial to the plot.- Hints of romance: While in Sakamichi the romance seems to be a love triangle and not much important to the plot, in Shigatsu the heroine might play a bigger part in the hero's development. Personally I believe Sakamichi is targeted to an older audience and better developed than Shigatsu but both are very enjoyable and have wonderful instrumental music, as well as unique artwork. read more 
Both are music orientated with the male protagonist who is a quiet, calm composed  pianist. They both have romantic acquaintances as well as other family issues 
Both are series that focus on teenage piano-playing glasses-wearing protagonists who encounter romance in their lives. The only difference is that the main character of Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso plays music with a girl, unlike in Sakamichi no Apollon where the main character plays music with other guys. 
Both revolve around the idea of finding yourself and expressing your most inner emotions through music, though with shigatsu this is the focal point, whilst with sakamichi it's supplementary. Both bring out the best in their genre of music with unforgettable soundtracks. Pitch perfect performances from both protagonists. 
Both shows use music as a medium for character development and growth, as well as to connect the characters together. Both have great soundtracks and fluid animation, especially in Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, art plays a fundamental role in the music scenes to forge appropriate symbolism and motifs, as well as to aid and compliment the experience delivered to the audience. They both constantly emphasise the epiphany felt by the characters because of music.Shigatsu is based on classical music whereas Kids on the Slope (Sakamichi no Apollon) is based on jazz music and both are set in very distinct times and settings. Shigatsu is more modern, while the latter is set around the 1960s.   read more 
Both involve a main character of classical piano training, and another that plays an instrument more....unconventionally, freely. Both series made me view music differently in terms of how people play music, as well as motivations behind each, and character devolopment. 
★Both revolve around a group of teenagers, which share a powerful bond and have fun as their youths fly by.★Both contain wonderful music, each one tackling a different genre.★Both have beautiful animation.★Both have a unique mood/atmosphere and feel very realistic + they portray their respective surroundings very well. 
both of them was a Romance-Music themed anime, where between Romance Story and the Musical Scene have a balanced strength on itWhile Shigatsu have a Junior High School student for main Character, Sakamichi's main character was a Senior High School studentShigatsu plays a Classical Music, Sakamichi plays a Jazz Music 
Kids on the Slope arguably has better musical performances and a more complex love web to boot. It's not as MC focused or melodramatic as Your Lie in April, so it's a nice choice for people who are looking for another music orientated anime that is similar enough for those fans longing for that sense of nostalgia but different enough so that it doesn't feel like you're rewatching Your Lie in April. For those who like good music and awkward teenage angst.  
Both animes are similar in the sense that they focus on character development over plot. This is done by using music to convey emotion and strengthen bonds. Also, both animes have an underlying romance theme. 
Both have beautiful music, Kids on the Slope is a mixture of Jazz with Classical piano while Your Lie in April is all classical piano/violin. The stories to both involve themes of romance and friendship shown through music. I would give the edge to Your Lie in April but if you liked one then you are sure to like the other. 
While it hasn't fully completed airing, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso shares the same themes of music and friendship that are prevalent in Sakamichi no Apollon. Although Sakamichi no Apollon did it fairly better. 
Your Lie in April is to classical as Kids on the Slope is to jazz. Both shows have superb soundtracks that work perfectly with the show to capture the best attributes of each musical genre. On top of this, both shows involve a love web between lovable characters trying to find themselves through their music. If you watch either of these, expect to be left in emotional shambles.Coincidently, these are my brother's two favorite shows. Lol, nerd. 
Shigatsu and Sakamichi. Both series:- They are about a pianist, who has a demotivation, the root of his family, which has turned him into an indecisive, which is achieved with a person who will encourage him to pursue his dreams, and to leave behind those pressures of the past. In addition this person plays an instrument, which together they will make the music that will give meaning to their lives.- These series deal with loyalty, friends, who will always be there to support you despite the entanglements that life brings. A romantic story, where love will flavor the facts that support the characters to move forward. read more 
The two are school life dramas that integrate music into the plot. These shows will give you a roller coaster of emotions through their awesome visuals, well-crafted characters and masterful story telling. Your ears are also in for a treat as you listen to excellently performed classical music in Shigatsu was Kimi no Uso and jazz in Sakamichi no Apollon.  
Both has a glasses wearing, pianist guy as protagonist. Both also mainly telling about friendship, romance, and drama between each of the character, accompanied (no pun intended) by music as the theme of both anime.The difference is Shigatsu using classical piece as the theme while Sakamichi using jazz as the theme. 
Both musicalMain character is pianistThe characters & highschool romance are similar somehowBut Shigatsu for classic music & sakamichi is concerned with jazz 
Both involve music and sadness, but in varying degrees. 
Both series are fantastic stories about friendship, music and love. 
You could say that Sakamichi is the 'mature' version of Shigatsu. Here are my reason to watch Sakamichi no Apollon if you loved Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso:- Both focus around music as the main play of each story- Both have emotional parts in the anime- Both have a beautiful soundtrack- Both have lovable characters that the viewer can totally relate toThe only thing that may put you off is that Sakamichi is a lot more mature than Shigatsu. Enjoy! 
On the outside looking in you could say they are similar because both shows focus on music throughout the series but I recommend this show because they have the same undertone and feel to them. If you have seen one of these shows and liked it, I highly recommend you watch the other.    
- They both are really good animes.- The music takes a big relevance in both stories, Sakamichi in jazz and Shigatsu in classical. - The art is pretty good and they have romance there too. - And both of the MC are piano players with glasses and a little geeks xD 
-They both share somewhat the same type of male lead-Both revolve around a group of teenagers as they handle life their own way-YLIA is definitely for the more emotional types of watchers-Both are made around a particular type of music as it's base 
- Music-themed- If you like Sakamichi no Apollon and its soundtrack, listen to the classical soundtrack by the greats like Chopin, Beethoven, Mozart, etc.- Male-oriented; the main character is a sad prodigy musician Kousei- Also romance-themed- The angst 
To a musician such as myself, Sakamichi no Apollon, or Kids on the Slope is basically the jazz version of Your Lie in April. Of course, there are vast differences in the plots of both, but the music is what appeals to an individual like myself first and foremost. "
23273,33352,15,"Both have an amazing, emotional, slice of life storyline backed by phenomenal scores, and the animation for them is among the best I've ever seen. Both are examples of a love it or hate it anime, but if you enjoyed one, I'm almost positive you will also enjoy the other. 
Both pile on heavy with the melodrama and you know it but you still cry.Thematically they may not be similar but the feels are strong with both. 
Beautiful and heart breaking drama, learning feelings and accepting the death of a loved one 
The both masterpieces are sentimental animes as well, they are drama stories with a very good script. 
Similarities:-Both expresses deep emotions through scenes involving solemnity, despair and sadness.-Both anime gives the viewer a powerful impact wherein one character shows despair or sadness.-Both anime have great animation.-Both anime have the point of focus to a young girl.-Both anime involves death of loved ones (spoiler alert *sorry* T~T)Differences:-Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso expresses emotions to its viewers through music while on the other hand, Violet Evergarden is about the tragedy of war the main character has gone through and is being brought back being it's flashback and its dignity to help people achieve what they want to have through her writings on letters.-Violet Evergarden does not contain expressions from music.-Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso has 4 main characters while in Violet Evergarden, there is only one.-Violet Evergarden renders bloody and tragic flashbacks about the spoils of war the main character has gone through while on the other hand, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso doesn't.

Both are very emotional, moving animes that can bring tears to your eyes. Both animes address the ideas of love and how emotions make us human which is very beautiful in its own right.  Both have similar art styles and as a bonus, both have fantastic soundtracks as well! 
Both focus on the beauty and tragedy of love and loss with stunning visuals, beautiful soundtracks, and artistic atmosphere. 
Beautiful artwork, and so much feels! 
-Both deal with a concept of ""reaching someone""-Both deal with self-discovery; finding a piece of yourself that you lost/never had-Both have the main, underlying themes of love and loss 
Literally a torrent of emotions ... For those who like it, these are must-watch. For others, I recommend also if only for drawing and animation. And such beautiful soundtrack can only help... 
Hello <https://myanimelist.net/profile/King_Korubi>Hei! I've been thinking to recommend you emotionally drama here, Please don't miss Violet Evergarden because it will be shaking your heart a little bit. you will drown in your emotional in this anime. overall it will good to see, and you will have no regret.  
It is just as heart-warming and pure as 'Violet Evergarden'. It carries a similar theme of love although Violet Evergarden is tend to set differently in an older era and much more beautiful themes.  
Both are extremely touching shows and have beautiful visuials and sound 
you r gonna cry in both 
Both are sad anime dramas.Violet Evergarden might start out as one of your not-so-funny slice of life anime, but when THOSE episodes come, it will sure bring a tear to your eye. "
23273,32281,8,"Deeply moving, beautiful music. Both highlight the inner struggle and the influence of other people in understanding this struggle.  
Fabulous OST first of all, but these are deserving of their high ratings. Both have a story that is very strong and interesting to follow, and by rewatching these you can see new things that you hadn't the first time. Both story's are incredibly well told with twists and turns, but the entire thing is covered in foreshadowing. Along with beautiful art style, I am really glad that they both receive credit for all of the amazing attributes of these anime 
Premise wise and all, not similar at all. They feature personal connections and love as driving plot points in common, but that would be about it.What you're looking to watch Kimi no Na wa for after this is for that same GUT WRENCHING, POWERFUL, feels moment. In everything I've watched (which to some salted veterans of this site is very little but I digress) nothing has hit that emotional roller coaster ride quite like these two experiences.Don't do them back to back. You won't cope. 
although the story is completey different, but the way they apply the realistic feeling of human are the same and u could feel how the character was feeling. And also after finishing kimi no na wa/ shigatsuwa kimi no uso, will have the same feeling, the emotions keep roling in your head and heart.  
Both stories can tap into the feels of their audience like no one else by utilizing their art and background music to develop a an emotionally charged atmosphere. 
Both have amazing music and animation. Both of these anime are quite sad and might  make you cry. 
Are you longing for the bittersweet, sad feeling you got from Kimi no Na wa? Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso is a marathon of sadness compared to Kimi no Na wa's more perfectly tuned length. Their plots are quite different, but both are set around teenagers and their personal relationships. As a emotional fix, this is the perfect followup to Kimi no Na wa. 
Both Your Lie in April and Your Name have ""your"" in the title. Both of these titles follow mainly a male protagonist with a female supporting. These titles are easily able to pull tears out of you and keep you intrigued the entire way through. "
23273,28851,7,"Superficially, we get a melodrama on both shows with a male protagonist suffering from their internal conflicts and a heroine that becomes a catalyst for the protagonist to grow. But why I believe these two are very similar is due to sharing a similar thematic irony. In Koe no Katachi, the protagonist learns to ""hear the world"" from a deaf girl. Likewise, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso has a similar underlying theme as well. Moreover, the animation and OST on both animes are beautifully executed as well.   
Both are about an mc who suffers from a depression and are helped by someone who is entering their life and completely change it for the positive. 
This recommendation isn't to say that you'll enjoy Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso if you liked Koe no Katachi, but if you liked Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, it's very likely you'll like Koe no Katachi. Describing why this is the case is difficult. Too difficultIn both this cases I recommend the sub, although the english dubs of both are also very well made. The issue is that the translations are too literal for Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso and too loose for Koe no Katachi.  
If you want to get very emotional, this is also a good request. 
both heartbreaking anime about a boy and a girl bonding together. eventually, something happens, which make both anime amazing. these anime will affect you and potentially make you cry 
Both are about teens facing their demons 
2 Very emotional series wich i really liked watching both talk about how important friendship can be for all of us :) "
23273,39533,4,"Its very similar in terms of how both animes take their characters on a smiliar journey of dealing with life through music and romance. And both have beautiful music and extremely emotional messages along with everything else. As a BL it has a far more realistic portrayal of relationships as well. 
Music is the focus of both anime and they both prioritize different instruments in the musical spectrum; therefore. it gives watchers different perspectives and enjoyable yet different anime to watch in the same category. 
Both of these will make you cry! Your lie in April is so heart warming but so sad and Given will hit you in the feels with the back story (given is BL but it doesn’t get weird) 
These are 2 great music anime with a deep story behind them. while the story differs quite a bit, both are very emotional and heartfelt series. also the music performed in both shows are incredible, it will leave you thinking about the song for hours after you stop watching. "
23273,22789,3,"Both series are about a by-the-book artist opening up and becoming more creative.In Barakamon, it's by moving to the countryside and meeting people there.In Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, it's by meeting another artist. 
Few individuals in this world are fortunate enough to do what they love for a living, and even fewer are perseverant enough to continue to love what they do for a living. Have you ever picked up an interest that had so inspired you when you were little, only to be overwhelmed by the expectations and obligations involved as you tread deeper into the field?Putting aside the fact that one anime is a drama and the other a comedy, Shigatsu and Barakamon both pull off thematic character developments in strikingly similar manners, delving into the core epiphany of the Arts where one's talent serves not merely in maintaining a living or impressing others but more importantly in the reflection, the expression, and the enrichment of one's own self. Let the stories of the characters within  inspire you, or perhaps remind you once again, to live and improve with passion. read more 
Both stories deal with an artist who used to be the best in their field, but due to some event, they are unable to produce their level of art anymore. They both end up meeting with another person (multiple in Barakamon) who essentially reshapes the MC and teaches them there is more to their respective arts than just doing them the way critics want them toIn more specifics, YLiA deals with the MC unable to recreate his music due to the death of his mother, and Barakamon deals with a painter that is unable to create his own unique style of work. "
23273,35180,3,"Both protagonists look like they could be brothers and they have a very similar personality. They both deal with depression and loneliness, but are also gifted with a special talent in their field. Both series have an unique color palette and look very good.  
-The protagonists have similar sort of introverted personalities-Their outlook changes eventually after meeting other characters and new rivals 
Not sure if this comparison is done often but it probably is, the main characters in both of these series both struggle with internal loneliness, obligation, and the feeling of being out of place or lacking a support system. They are also somewhat saved or changed by a kind group of females/female that helps encourage them and provide them with warmth they lacked before. I got a lot of your lie in April vibes watching Gatsu and if you like your lie in april in turn I think you'd be able to love Gatsu, and if you liked Gatsu you probably watched your lie but you'd probably like your lie in turn, the main characters are VERY similar and it tackles similar themes regarding prodigies, pressure, obligation etc. Both series are also animated wonderfully as well. read more "

23273,28171,2,"Both shows are really good at showcasing their respective professions (cooking/music), and fully explore the highs and lows of being 100% dedicated to their craft.Both shows feature a main character that is a master (or former master) of music/cooking, with a second character that is relatively weak/shy who grows tremendously by learning from the main character.Through these characters, the shows explore just how cruel these professions can be, requiring the students to devote themselves for long hours over weeks, just for a chance at success. Notably, Shokugeki takes place in a school featuring the world's top culinary students, but only 1% of that group makes it past year 1. Students suffer through endless trials that are intentionally unfair, and judges are frustratingly harsh. With Your Lie in April, the main character suffers severe trauma as a result of the pressure from family and friends. Later, the main character is put in charge of tutoring a young student, who experiences similar bouts of agony in preparing for a performance.  A combination of peer/family pressure, sky-high expectations, rigorous school/training demands, and personal motivation pushes every student to sacrifice everything in order to just barely survive. read more 
In terms of genre, plot-structure, or general feel of the anime, there really isn't much similarity.HOWEVER, after experiencing the heart-shattering, onion-peeling soul destruction that is Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, Shokugeki no Soma is a good change of pace to get your broken, voidless life back into knowing what laughter kinda felt like.Also both the MC's are skilled in their craft, and its nice watching both of them excel/get better :) "
23273,1210,2,"In a classic ""boy meets girl"", spring came to the protagonists who face mental problems which makes it difficult to fulfill their dreams, to receive help from a girl that will make you transcend himself. 
These shows are alike in so many ways, first of all both are major feel trips. Both have protagonists relate-able to the point you'll feel like you're watching an autobiography on yourself. Both of the mc's desperately try to avoid something they hold dear to them due to a traumatic experience, but timely encounters with a mysterious girl and friends (pervy best friends as well) inspire them to break out of their shell.  Both are really just amazing shows. "
23273,10408,2,"Tears, tears, tears, and more tears.Both have ethereal and bittersweet romance,Although settings are a bit different, one is school and a TV show, thus more time to develop, while hotarubi is a movie, but trust me, a beautifully worded and animated one.Not for people who want happy ever afters, although tragedies can also be beautiful in their own ways. 
Both of them has ""loser"" kind of mc, and other stuffs (no spoiler intended) "
23273,22135,2,"Bespectacled protagonist with an immense talent struggles to actually be able to use it. Two main characters must brave the gulf that has started in between them. Both protagonists are sympathetic and wonderfully designed. 
Both hit you hard in the feels and use a specific medium (Ping pong - Music) to advance the plot and develop the characters, without it overpowering the story. "
44,2418,4,"Both shows take place in feudal Japan, a time during which samurai were prominent.  Although the plot is widely different between Tsuiokuhen and Sword of the Stranger, each show gives amazing and graphic sword battles in conjunction with a beautiful soundtrack.  In addition, the feeling that both shows give you can be deemed similar.   
Both have a lot of blood, gore, tragedy and sword fights. 
Similar stories focusing on two Ronin with tragic pasts that end up becoming attached to a character and fighting for their sake, despite their initial reluctance and lack of empathy. Tsuiokuhen is much darker in style and substance than Sword of the Stranger although both retain a serious tone. Beautiful soundtracks in both titles also create much of the immersion and emotional value of the experience. It wouldn't be unlikely for somebody to cry during the endings of these titles.  
Besides the fact that both revolve around skilled swordsmen with similar emotional backgrounds, they also share gorgeous animation, deftly executed action sequences, and powerful soundtracks. Must-sees for sure. "
44,33,3,"Like Kenshin, it is a psychologically realistic exploration the motivations effects of the killing life on one's mind and state of being, albeit in a very different ways. Likewise the drive and effect of ideology are explored but instead of the deadening of the heart and soul as we find in Kenshin, in Beserk it is the corrupting effects of power and ambition.Both have compelling narratives, and while Beserk may not have the lavish animation we find in Kenshin, it is still an immersing and engrossing watch.And both have compelling narratives albeit in highly different settings. 
The two works depict a particularly worked main character living in a world without mercy that has taken away his childhood.With violence as the only defense against a tragic and inevitable destiny, these two heroes will each meet a woman they will try to protect from all their beings.I'm talking about two of the biggest tragedies of Japanese animation. Brutal, beautiful, upsetting. 
Both are concentrated adaptations of a flashback sequence in their respective parent mangas (for Berserk it is an adaptation of the Golden Age arc while for Rurouni Kenshin this OVA adapts the Remembrance sequence in the Jinchu arc). Both series leave stuff out from the manga but also add stuff in, giving each piece a more stand alone feel. In my opinion, the story and characters of both series are incredibly well developed. Guts and Kenshin are somewhat comparable, both are youths who are very good at swordsmanship and join a certain group of warriors. Romance plays a role in both series and they end in a similar emotional manner (events between them vary WILDLY). Both build up to their finales with foreshadowing, and they deal with heavy themes too. To me at least, Berserk and Tsuikou-hen give off a very oppressive and dark vibe, and comedy is sparse and becomes non-existent by the end. Berserk and Tsuikou-hen have quite brutal actions scenes that honestly unsettled me at times.Berserk is much longer than Tsuikou-hen, the former is a full 25 episode series while the latter is a 4 part OVA that can be edited into a 2-hour movie. Berserk is a dark fantasy set in a fictional universe while Tsuikou-hen is historical fiction set during the Bakumatsu.  read more "

2nd Season of Diamond no Ace and Haikyuu!!Both are similiar. The main character is interesting.Both are very funny and entertaining.Both have good character development.Both are realistic, well this is shounen so there will be some unique abilities.But the abilities is not supernatural-like, so you still can tolerate it.If you like Diamond no Ace, you will like Haikyuu!! as well  
Both the second seasons of Diamond no Ace and Haikyuu!! Are pretty similar both focus on teamwork, friendship and have heart racing moments  "
1575,1535,548,"This seems to be a pretty common comparison - probably because Light and Lelouch are practically the same character.  Both shows feature quite a bit more intellectual sparring than your typical shounen fare, and both main characters have very similar personalities (they're closer to being villains than heroes) and abilities (ridiculously powerful but with prominent weaknesses that require careful planning to circumvent).   
Lots of thinking involved, and the main character exploits a 'magical power' to try to change the world. 
Genius's with a special power using their brain strategising and  planning. Light and Lelouch have similar ideals and try to change the world in the name of justice but acts more like the villain 
Two student who get a power and use it to rid the world of evil, but it slowly takes them over. Both shows are very similar, and Light = Lelouch. 
both the main characters' wish is to change the world with their own hands..plus the two main characters shares almost the same attitudes...plus the flow of the story too..it's kinda the same~ 
Main Characters have the same kind of intentions. Both are smart and use good strategies/tactics, very interesting. Main characters both have interesting powers. 
Both anime are like a chess game. Very strategic and different from what you've seen before. 
The two opposing protagonists in each series fights for what they believe is true justice. 
It's kind of like Death Note with mechs and lots of big bosomed girls.  It has some of the same sort of premise that Death Note does, and some of the same atmosphere, but it takes itself a lot less seriously.  It also plays out less like a thriller, but it has some of the same sort of cat and mouse element that Death Note has.  You might not like Code Geass, but there are enough similarities that you probably should give it a shot.   
The situation is totally different, but in both the main character is very sharp and uses his brain all the time. Though in Death Note the main character had to fight other mastermind, in Code Geass he had to defeat a whole empire.Both of them will make you want more. 
Code Geass has more or less the same idea as Death Note, the ally of justice, but a ""zero"" instead of ""kira"" and some mind work here and there. the differences are: Code Geass is more colourful+humorous, the protagonist is more emotional and less clever when compared to light. 
The series are both about 1 person that gets a power to do good things, but some people think it isnt good what they does, some people do. (In death note, the killing of criminals, and in Code Geass he wants that the 11's can be called Japanese again) They have both a friend, who's on the 'battlefield' an enemy.(sorry if my english isnt good) 
The main characters of both shows are remarkably similar. The only significant differences are that Lelouch, unlike Light, has more reasoning behind his actions than simple boredom and Lelouch cares about more people than just himself. If you've watched Death Note first you'll half expect Lelouch to start screaming about becoming the God of the new world.The series themselves are quite different. Death Note is set in our world, where as Code Geass is set in an alternate universe where Britannia rules most of the world. Code Geass has bright colours, comedy and ecchi, Death Note does not. However, there really aren't many anime with characters quite like Light and Lelouch, and the similarities they share are more than enough reason for a fan of one to like the other. read more 
Very similar plot. A boy who gets the power to make anyone do what he wants and use it to change the world they live in. Both very interesting with unique characters (except maybe for suzaku). ""The bad guy"" in the main character position, everyone against him. 
The plot of Light/ Kira (Ryoko) vs. Lelouch/ Zero (C.C.), with same smart cold (evil in a way) main character with an abnormal power who uses it to change the world to a better place from his own point of view for justice 
In both series there is someone trying to make a better world with help from something special. Death Note has it's notebook and in Code Geass there is the Geass. 
Although Code Geass might involve a few mechas, it bares a strong resemblance to Death Note, they both include a main character who is a genius and who has just acquired a supernatural power which they wish to use to reform the world into their ideal. So if you enjoyed Death Note you might also want to check out Code Geass. 
Both Kira(Light) and Zero(Lelouch) want to create a new world. L and Suzaku are against their methods of creating this new world. The only difference is that Light is idealist, while Lelouch is realist. And L is realist, Suzaku an idealist.  
Rather similar theme of both main characters trying to create a better world via their manipulative alter ego's. Both characters also start out with good intentions, but start to lose their own ideals along the way and become more out of control. 
Code Geass is similar to Death Note in how they deal with morality issues such one's justice.  They both play mind games with their enemies expect Code Geass is more of that of the military nature.  The main characters in both uses mostly anyone they could as their pawn in order to achieve their victory.  
Well, they are both awesome for one, the protagonists are similar, they think alike I guess, And the cliffhangers...I thought I'd die from watching these -_- I think the main similarity is the characters and what they hope to achieve - World Domination (sorta) and the animes are about how they go about that. 
Both protagonists have their lives changed dramatically when they encounter a being who gives them strange powers, and they both use their power to pursue their ideals. 
The similarity here is quite obvious. Hyper-smart main characters are bestowed with a special power, which they then make use of to change the world to their liking, through plotting, planning and strategy. 
Quite similar. Although the main characters have diferent objectives, they both want to rule the world, and also have the 'master-mind' needed to do that. If you liked Death Note, watch Code Geass; and if you liked Code Geass, watch Death Note! 
The main characters of these series gain a power to control/kill people and they want to change the world. 
Despite how Code Geass has mechas and intense action scenes, both of these series both have a highly intellegent main character given a special gift/power that is used to turn the tide of the world.  While Death Note may have more clever ideas and less action, Code Geass still has a great main character full of ambition and has some of the most exciting mecha action there is.  When it comes down to it, you can't help but appreciate the brilliant minds of Light Yagami and Lelouch, and if you liked one,you'll probably like the other. 
Code Geass and Death Note are similar to each other in a way that they make the viewers (watchers) think of who is really justice and the like. They are both intelligent animes. If you like Death Note, I guess you'll also like Code Geass, and vice versa. 
Both of main character obtain a power that will change the world. Not only that, both of main character is very intelligent,dare to make risky move that usual people don't want to. 
Code Geass and Death Note were pretty much like each other, in my opinion at least. Death Note was too dark for my taste, whereas Code Geass has somewhat similar plot and the main character isn't so evil at all, at least not until the very end, and even that is debatable. However, Code Geass isn't as deeply intellectual series as Death Note. So, if you liked one of these, you might really like the other one too. 
The two main characters have the same twisted mind frame, using strategy to kill in order to create a ""new and better world."" 
In both animes the main character - an ordinary boy in the beginning - gets super-powers and decides to change the world by very cruel and remorseless means. 
The anime differs much. But when it comes to the main characters, they have alot in common. They both have that so called unique way of thinking, not to mention how smart both are. And they might also have the same goal. 
Light and Lelouch have similar personality and demeanor with different motives and methods.Light wants to create a world where there is no crime, with the us of the DeathNote he began killing criminals with unforgivable crimes.While Leouch got the Geass which he uses along with his intellect to undermine and eventually crush an Empire.Both the characters through-out the series face rivals which challenge their intellect and wit to the limits. 
probably the only similarity is few characteristics of the main character. Light Yagami and Lelouch are secretively trying to destroy the bad guys (criminals in DN and ruthless Britannia empire in CG). Similar to how Light keeps fighting L, Near, Mello by using various strategies, Lelouch has to deal with his best friend, who is empire's servant in a similar way except that CG's setting is in a future where Robots (controlled by humans) do the fighting. I don't want to go in further details, but let me assure you that if you liked DN, you will also like CG for sure. 
When I finished Death Note, I was going through such bad withdrawal that I needed to find another anime that was similar to watch.Code Geass did it for me. Although I think it's not as thrilling and suspenseful as Death Note, it definitely has my thumbs up. The story idea of a character having the power to change the world is similar. The setting, fighting, and etc. are different. Actually, I think Code Geass has more action than Death Note since it deals a bit with the military and stuff.So, if you like Death Note and you like guns and fighting, I'd say go for Code Geass. It helped me through my Death Note withdrawal, and I hope it can do the same for you! read more 
Lead roles are quite similar: both are given a rather limited superpower, and decide to create a better world with it. Cat and mouse mindgames ensue with the rest of the world, where both sides use underhanded tactics to gain victory. 
Both portagonists want to make a better world using a supernatural power, both are very intelligent and both will do anything to achieve their objectives. 
Lelouch Lamperouge and Yagami Light share some characteristics. They both want too change the world at all cost. Not a single death is too much for them. Although there are no Mecha's in Death Note, and no Shinigami's in Code Geass, I am sure that if you liked the one, you will like the other, so jump into the lives of these Anti-Heroes, and see what they will do for their goals! 
Both of the main characters, Light and Lelouch, are very intelligent, and consistently demonstrate their abilities throughout each of their respective series. If you liked that cleverness from Death Note, you will definitely enjoy Code Geass. 
main characters are extremely similar. both receive a power that allows them to control others. both have generally good intentions but have extreme ways to achieve that goal. right from the first episode i couldn't help but think this guy is just like Light. 
This anime has the perfect ""death note"" feel to it... the main character thinks almost the same way light does and hopes to accomplish a somewhat similar goal... only through different means. although its very similar to death note it has far more action and far more characters that play an important role in the store. shame there is no ""L"" like character in code though.... 
Code Geass is similar to Death Note in that Lelouch can kill people with out touching them or make them do what ever he wants.  
Both Code Geass and Death Note follow the stories of ingenious and charismatic young men who gain a special power.  Both characters use their new power to attempt to change the world. Both animes are full of suspense and twists! 
I realized how similar these two animes are right from the first episode, both have amazing character personalities, great animation and both make you watch more and more even though you should be doing something else... 
From the general idea behind both shows, to subtle details, Code Geass IS Death Note, but with mechs. Seeing as how Death Note was first and also, in my opinion, easily the better of the two shows, Code Geass can be considered a Death Note-ripoff. If you like exotic character design and giant robots, you may enjoy Code Geass more, but overall, Death Note does a much better job of telling the story of a young man who gains a supernatural power and wishes to improve society through controversial means. Death Note is more thought-provoking while Code Geass emphasizes the typical shounen aspects more. 
Both main characters have a limited amount of power to control other peoples mind / life span. Even tho the main characters are similar, code geass has alot of mecha action while death note has barely any action. But both of them are still great! 
Just like everyone else says, the main characters, Light and Lelouch, are similar in their genius minds and willpower to change the world. Not only that but both of the stories unfolded quite well and were unpredictable till the end. 
Geass is something like Death Note. Both main characters (who have a strong sense of justice) come into possession of that mysterious power, which allows them to change the world. They have comrade-in-arms, who gave them that ability (C.C. and Ryuuk). So both Lelouch (under the alias Zero) and Light (under the alias Kira) start a mind game and wage war against that rotten world, which should be destroyed and rebuilded again as a better place. 
Both series focus on a character that could be seen as either good or evil; A character who is trying to usurp the current rulers and set himself at the top. Also, both Lelouch and Light are tactical geniuses, both have an almost psychopathic and egotistical side, but all the while they are very good at keeping up a calm and collected facade in front of other people. Finally, both possess something of supernatural power that allows them to get ahead in the game quickly, but may or may not be their downfall in the end.Both are tales of Revolution. 
There is good action but that is not what i think it is all about.  It is more the psychological aspect that is really interesting.  There is more action in code geass - hangyaku no lelouch but i think that the death note has a more detailed story line. 
The animation styles are very different. Code Geass may look lighter or happier, but both anime deal with dark themes of control, death, judgment, and power.While Death Note takes place in our world, Code Geass takes place in a sort of alternate history based world with Mecha, a complex political situation, and a dystopian landscape in Japan.In both cases a very intelligent character who is seemingly normal otherwise, is suddenly presented with a supernatural power and the choice of what to do with it. Both decide to use their new found power to change the world for, in their opinion, the better; but, not everyone feels the use of such power is ethical, or, agrees how to make the world better, and the characters face opposition. In Death Note the conflicts are much closer, as they do not involve international politics or battles, they are more centered on the minds of the two main protagonists. Code Geass involves much of the same chess style psychological battling, but, applies it to the grand stage of world power struggles as well as character driven motivations. Both anime feature plot twists and a sense of unpredictability, if you enjoyed one, you will likely enjoy the other, though, they are different in many ways and should not be watched with expectations of intense similarity.Code Geass is concluded in the season season, Code Geass r2 read more 
The main characters are both ""evil"" masterminds behind a plot to save the world. They both acquire a supernatural power and use it to their full potential, c.c. is like ryuk. and Lelouch's geass is like Light's death note. Both have friends on the enemy's side that are unaware of their identity. Code Geass is a little more childish and unrealistic, but if you enjoyed the intellectual Death Note you can't miss this anime! 
Both feature similar protagionists and both series have a more thinking and suspense style to it then it does with action scenes. The primary difference between the two is that Code Geass involves politics and warfare where as Death Note is more based on crime and detective work. 
Death Note and Code Geass's plot are very similar. The main characters in both anime created a name for themselves such as Zero and Kira. Both of them keep their faces hidden and want to uphold justice. 
Its has almost the same main character and have the same problem for the mainthat he goes against the community and try to destroy/ change the world.they both use some sored of mystical power and uses it on many people (for light its the death note, for lelouch its the giass). 
They are bot similar to each other, the stuggle between ""good"" and ""evil"". The two masterminds Yagami Light and Lelouch Lamperouge have similarities on how they want the world to be and to bow before them...  
Both deal with a man who obtains a mysterious power and use it to improve the world and rid it of their definitions of evil 
Main characters are very similar, both are manipulative and sharp/shrewd, as they try to think their way out of their situation, using this the powers they're given. 
the main characters seem to be the anatagonists rather than protagonists... and they often, if not sometimes, become ""berserk"" with what power they have! and they're both bishies >///< also the stories both feature are somewhat inlolving death 0.oand both series have good soundtracks =]]] 
Both are great shows, with main characters wanting to change the goal, there are similiarities in the main characters actions however they are still two entirely different people and different shows but most people who like one end up like the other show 
if you love yagami light in Death Note then you'll love Lelouchboth of them are main chacters who try to fix the world where people can live happily and to prevail justiceusing the special powers and abilities they are given, Lelouch and Light can be less different  
Through out the whole series just like in death note it makes your mind go crazy they are are both mind thrillers and makes you think of what outcomes could happen to the characters. 
RUN! RUN! SOMEBODY IS KILLING EVERYBODY! Is it right? Is it wrong? You figure it out while watching this! Its amazing how 1 person can change the world with just a little determinating, hard work, and magical powers. Your in for a treat. 
They both include two boys with a special power trying to change the world through that power, all the while trying to hide their real identities. 
Both have very complex stories about justifying their worlds. 
Take some concepts from Death Note, and add in a lot of mecha action. Both have main characters who want to change the world. Very interesting.  
Both have main characters that want change in the world and use various powers and strategy to obtain their goals. 
Both main characters Kira and Zero have special power-not psychical but this ability can change the world if used properly. In exchange for this ability they had to sign a contract. They both want to change the world and both are genius. 
A young high school student suddenly gains a mysterious and frightful power from a strange being. Testing, measuring, and finally executing their new abilities, along with all the peril and impacts on the human race, is the journey shared in these two shows. 
Both gain a supernatural power and wish to change the world with their new found power and ideals. 
This two animes are very similar.. with unguessable plots which may even give you a suprise.. Death note has Raito the main character who is very good with tactical strategies like Code Geass's Lelouch.. Both anime rocks.. lol.// 
Twisted lead protagonist in both series, where both don’t really care about others lives and look to use others to gain something. Both lead characters have exclusively a strange power in Code Geass it’s the power of ultimate Command for Lelouch and Death Note Kira has his this mystical book. Both series have friends that oppose each other and look to kill each other, and have a sort of tragic romance to them as well. Both are dark animes to some extent especially Death note. 
Both anime have the main character who wants to change the world for the better, and are very smart although Code Geass is for those that would also like some action, as there are a lot of fights with mecha, where Death Note is more supernatural.Death Note has wits and planned tactics, whereas Code Geass uses more strategy and is smart in a more military way. 
They both have the same evil protagonist deal.  Both Light and Lelouch have a power to help them get whatever they please.  However, Light's Death Note is a little more broad, allowing him to kill people without even meeting them, while Lelouch's geass makes him have to look at the person directly in the eye.Light has a manipulative type of personality once he picked up the Death Note, and when Lelouch got his Geass, he acquired this same type of hidden personality.  Both stories widen out with different antagonists and all sorts of different conflict.They are very interesting overall. 
If your a Code Geass fan you should love Death Note as I feel they are both similar character wise. In both, the main character gets a power to assist them in changing the world for the better in their views from a party whom follows them for the duration of the series. While doing so, they both gain followers who support their ideals. While this happens, a force attempt to fight the main character and discover their true identity.Both resemble a game of chess as the main character fights to knock out all obsticles in their way to have their ideas reality. 
The stories of Code Geass and Death Note are similar in many ways. First of all, the main characters of both series want to take over the world by using the powers that they were given. Both Geass and Death Note are used to give people orders, but the power of the Death Note always results in death. Both series are ones that keep you hooked till the last episode in my opinion, and in Code Geass' case, it leaves you with many unanswered questions. 
They are both powerful, destructful, and Evil anime i have ever seen. Code Geassis more destructive and more tactics. The turn arounds in Code Geass are unbelievable. Death Note will just blow your mind out from inside and out. The strategies that goes against eachother are simply amazing. They both rock my socks. 
The characters and morals are near identical. Both use a power to take over the world and the people in it. Both main characters names begin with ""L"". Both fight for the weak, the good and ""justice"" which for both is an argueable concept in both worlds. The only difference is that Mechs are much more prevalentin Code Geass then in the Death Note universe. 
Both anime are based around geniuses that obtain the power to change the world, and do so. It's very entertaining to watch how the plot plays out as their enemies of equal intelligence battle it out in a battle of tactical and strategical thinking. Both are great anime, and are my top two favorite anime. 
Its quite obvius why are those two similar. They both have strategic games between a studant with big ideals. 
Light ""Kira"" Yagami and Lelouch ""Zero"" Lamperouge are very similar characters. Both of them have genius intellects, a supernatural ability with very specific limitations, and a desire to change the world under a false name.In terms of differences, Code Geass is more fast-paced, and since it is set in a world with giant robots, there are plenty of large-scale action scenes - Lelouch's strategic genius is always pivotal here. It does, however, has fewer mindgames than Death Note - there is no L figure, though there is an ""Athrun Zala figure"".Lelouch is less fully evil than Light, with more clear motivations for his acts. Interestingly, he regards himself as a monster while Light regards himself as above morality. read more 
The main characters are very similar, both are really smart guys, they hide his real identity, both have an extraordinary and supernatural power given by a powerful entity, and have a really ambitious goal. 
Lelouch is like a more just and less egotistical Kira from Death Note. C.C. is his Ryuk. It's a great series and, unlike Death Note, the ending is satisfying. 
In death note, you have light yagami; an excellant star student who is bored out of his mind. he finds a notebook that kills people when you write their name in it, with it he trys to rid the world of all evil. In code geass:lelouch of the rebellion, you have lelouch lamperouge;an intelligent student, who wants to make a world where his little sister, nanally can find happiness. He recieves a power from a girl named C.C, a power called geass; he uses this power to destory his fathers, the emperor of the holy brittanian empire. 
Death Note's main character has a similar power to the Code Geass main character.Both of the main character's enemies have a different sense of justice, (Suzaku and L). And...both of the main characters do alot of planning, thinking and have a great strategic mind. 
Both feature anti-hero main characters who are brilliant strategists. However, Code Geass is more action-oriented, whereas Death Note is more cerebral.  
It has many of the same themes as Death Note, and Light's method of creating the new world is, while much more drastic, similar to Lelouch's morals-- to get what you want, you have to bloody your hands a little.  
Both series have a villain/anti-hero protagonist with a supernatural power to control people in some limited way, and a hero/anti-villain antagonist.  The protagonists are friends with the antagonists, and the antagonists' goal is to uncover the faceless, nameless alter-ego of the protagonist.  The protagonists are also pitted against their families.  Both shows make frequent use of miniature climaxes to go with short and simple story arcs.To begin with, Light and Lelouch are the same character with two exceptions: Light is athletic but Lelouch is not, and they have polar ideologies.  The comparison is endless between the two and includes several spoilers, so I won't go into it, but even most of the major events that happen to the characters are the same.  The important thing is that Light wants nothing but justice even at the cost of freedom, and Lelouch is vice versa. read more 
The two anime resemble each other with the main character obtains an abnormal power that could help him to change the world. In both anime, the main characters use this power to achieve good intention, but in Code Geass, the goal is for other's goods while in in Death Note, the goal is for the main charater's own good. So, you can experience a different view of using power in Death Note, and you can still feel the intense of the plot which is created from the battle between people with amazing deduction and persuasive arguments. 
If you liked see Yagami Light trying to be the new World God. You will love to see Lelouch Lamprouge trying to conquer the World 
While Light can kill people by writing names on the death note, Lelouch can control the mind of anyone with only visual contact.Both has as protagonists the ""villain"" of the story. 
Lelouch from Code Geass and Yagami Light from Death Note are similar characters. They both obtain a certain power and they both attempt to reshape the world with it to make it as they believe it should be. 
In both of the series, there's is one main character who's very smart and tries to change the wordl in it's own way.something what Death Note doesn't have, is that Code Geass is more about the main characters private life as well, and Death Note isn't. But if you don't like transformer like robots, than this might not be as good as Death Note, but still, try it.   
Although the enviroment and setting of both are quite different the stories are a bit the same. Both main characters recieve a power and use this to change the world. They both are really cool, but I myself prefer Death Note.  
Both have anti- heroes. Have a smart person trying to change the world. If you liked one, you will probably like the other 
Character wise there extremely simmilar, Lelouch and light the egotistical protaganists of the series along with Schniezel and L the masterminds trying to thwart their plans.Both are simmilar plotwise with both Lelouch and Light wanting the world to bow before them, with a justfull cause in mind but questionable methods of achieving this ideal world.anyways if you liked Deathnote go out there and watch Geass. 
The plot of the stories are completely different but the simularties between the characters Yagami Light and Lamperouge Lelouch are uncanny as they are ordinary students untill they come into contact with a supernatural power that they use to change the world in the name of justic they are both incredibly intelligent and both hide there identities behind the masks of Zero and Kira. There rivals prove to be a difficult match but have or gain a close relationship with their enemies. 
Both Lelouch and Light want to change the world, and obtain a power that allows them to do this: with Lelouch the geass, and Light the Death Note. Lelouch and Light are both insanely smart, as well as manipulative. 
Both Series are about ""Good"" superheroes who try to make world a better place,though they have diffirent attitudes toward it.both Lelouch and Light have some inhuman mystical power and are masterminds,who try to change the whole world.both are a must see for any fan of anime. 
Both feature a protagonist who gets some supernatural power and uses it to take a strong stance against society, bending the rules to suit themselves and letting nothing get in their way. 
Both Main Characters are very strategic and smart. Although the stories  are very different ,there is a great deal of similarities such as powers which aid them to their goals. 
The main character, who wants to implement his vision of the world, systematically striving for success and finally ... You must see it 
Similar plot with tons of twists and great character development. Awesome strategy and crazy smart people. Also super powers involved; notebook in Death Note and Geass power in Code Geass.  
Both are like a chess game. Light and Lelouch have a magical power (Light - Death Note, Lelouch - Geass) and they both want to change the world; Light freeing the world of criminals, Lelouch wanting Area 11 to become Japan again. They both take on aliases to cover themselves (Lelouch - Zero, Light - Kira, but Light just accepts the alias). The two protagonists act more like an antagonist. Suzaku, Lelouch's rival, is more of a protagonist, and same goes for Lawliet, Light's rival. After Light and Lelouch gets the power, the people who gave him the power follows. There are also other users of the power the character has. So, basically, Code Geass is Death Note, but with mechas (Knightmares). read more 
Both series has a similar way trying to solve the problem that they have or what they want to do. They both have an artistic power they use and manipulate people. 
They both have main characters that are very similar: both are intelligent, cunning, a little bit twisted, and basically antihero. Both the main characters have acquired an exclusive power that they can use to fulfill their ideals, and they would use any means to do so.  
Both involve highly intelligent students who receive powers from supernatural figures in which they use to change the world. Both of these students possess an infamous alter ego to captivate the world with. 
Cute, intelligent guys trying to change the world. Both are dark series though but with very good story lines! 
Code Geass is like a hybrid of Death Note and Gundam if you ask me.  Lot's of mech action and a character who enjoys playing god with his newfound abilities.  Death Note and Code Geass both have main characters who possess a god complex.  They also have the power to change the world, and they both intend to use it to justify that end.  If you enjoyed Death Note, then it's quite possible you'd like Code Geass as well.  Unless you're the type who's not into mechs, I don't really see any other deterrent for you to watch this. 
Both anime are similar because both main characters plan to change the world and by doing this, they later turn into bad guys and not the good guys. They both have something that orders somemone to do a certain thing. 
Both have characters that are mad at the world in some way and wish to change it. They also both get a god-like power from a mysterious character as well as...well you wouldn't want me to spoil it for you now would you?  
Both series have the genius guy trying to make thing his way, both are very intelligent and intresting.The main character in both anime have a very particular/supernatural power. 
Both feature a protagonist that acquires a special power at the beginning and they both gain craving for more power. 
Both series involve intelligent characters given the ability to hand out what they consider ""justice"". 
They're both very similar in that the main characters are both very intelligent, and both do what they believe is just, even though the rest of the world begs to differ.The only major difference is that Code Geass has giant robots involved named Knightmares, as where Death Note does not. 
A very inteligent plot that will keep you waching and wanting for more. 
As many will tell you; the main character of either series may as well be the same person. Watch as a single teenage boy, unexpectedly gifted with a great power draws in followers and leads them in the name of justice; only to fulfill his own agenda. Changing the world is easy when you control life and death. 
B'cause it's about strategy.....and the main character wants to make a new world with their mystical power...... 
Death note and Code Geass both focus on the main protagonist being drove by idealistic ideas of the ""perfect"" world. Light Yagami and Lelouch Lamperouge also share similiar personality traits, however Lelouch's sense of justice is more justified then Light's. 
Light = Lelouch; they both are geniuses and they want to change the world, regardless of the methods. Both full of drama and suspense, both are dark. 
In both Code Geass and Death Note, an incredibly intelligent teenage boy seeks to change the world with a secret, hidden, absolute power that very few know about. They differ in that Code Geass is much funnier while Death Note is much more serious, and that Lelouch uses his power for good, while Light is generally more selfish, especially towards the end. If you like Death Note, you'll DEFINITELY like Code Geass, but the same is not necessarily true in reverse. I personally prefer Code Geass by a lot, but both are awesome. I watched both series in dubs. 
They both focus, in some way or another, in ""justice"". The desire to create a better world is one of the forces which make the two protagonists move forward, using any necessary means to accomplish their goals, both aided by some kind of mysterious supernatural power. 
Both have main chacters who use changing the world to make it just as an excuse to kill millions for their own petty reasons: for Light it's to relieve boredom and for Lelouche it's for revenge. They both also start off with only their wits and a godlike power along with a mysterious helper who gave them that power for some price. That godlike power also drives both of them a little insane. They both also would put their plans at risk only for the sake of saving thier little sister. Later they also both gain   a secret identity so they can lead a group to help them  conquer the world.That secret identity is focused on more in dn than in cg.  In dn the other charcters besides the primary protagonist and antagonist play a very small role and so often remain undeveloped and one dimentional. Lelouche is also by far a more human, sympathetic and complex character who often shows emotions such as love, guilt and compassion.  read more 
Main characters have a similar demeanor and there is the same theme of what is justice? The conflict between Lelouch and Suzaku is very similar to the conflict between Light and L. 
Death note is often praised for it's superb intellect and twisting plot, this is definitely also the case in code Geass. As for the main characters, both of them aren't your everyday hero. You'll know what i mean after you've watched them both. In short Code Geass has everything what Death note has except for these aspects: the atmosphere in code Geass is less dark than in Death note, Code Geass includes quite a bit of mecha action, the ending in CD is, in my personal opinion, better than DN's ending. 
they are bothe psychological genre. The main characters in both anime are stargetic and anticipated the enemy they are against moves. Both anime are intese and once you get into it you will be sitting on the edge of your seat 
smart man (with name start in L :P) that use a unique power given to him to ""solve"" morally ambiguous ""problem"" 
A highly intelligent, politically minded teenage boy (with a superiority complex) who feels a strong sence of injustice in the world is granted the 'power' to make a difference - it's up to the viewer to decide whether or not he's a hero or villian.Both have a government theme.Both feature cutesie, not to street-wise, female leads with complex backgrounds.Both anime's are pretty much a fantasy set up - mecha's and death gods are unlikey to come into our lives. ;) 
Despite what a lot of people seem to be saying on here, Lelouch and Light and completely different characters. It's pretty easy to see that if you've watched both animes. However, that being said, Code Geass reminded me of Death Note a lot within the first couple of episodes. Both series pose major questions of morality on good verses evil, whether or not the means justify the end, etc. While not as serious, Code Geass does manage to have an extremely serious ending though it didn't compare to the ending of Death Note. 
Basically the same protagonist cept the one in code geass is quite a lot less of a creepit has more explosions too x) 
As they both are about a boy (roughly the same age) who wishes to changed the world with a special power they obtained from somebody else. They manipulate countless people to form the world that they wish and both shows are very interesting. 
If you liked Death Note, you will love Code Geass. I really enjoyed Death Note, but was completely blown away by Code Geass. Both main characters gain the power to change the world, both are driven by their own goals and ideals, and both start a journey filled with twists and turns and the characters' own views of what justice truly is. 
The same way to think they are on the top of the world and rebelion against the wrong system that they live in, mental wars and brain utility to win and not just physical strength. 
Similar mastermind protagonists (each with a special ability which can change the world), schemes and plots are set up and the ending is almost identical.Though while Deathnote has the fantasy/fairytale touch to it, Code Geass is based on giant robots and capital wars. 
Both anime are very strategic anime and has the most unexpected plot turns I have ever seen. You never know what is going to happen next. There are many differences, like Code Geass has mecha that Death Note doesn't have, but if you liked one of these you will definitely like the other. In both anime you are unsure if you should side with the main character or not. Both main charachters in both anime try to make the world a better place, but are their methods correct? 
Alrighty, now I know the MAL public is probably sick and tired of reading the same recommendation over 200 times, but one more can't hurt, right?Well, let's take a look at the similarities:-The main characters are attempting to defeat a certain power without revealing their identity.-Chess is mentioned often.-Both main characters have a special power that helps them conceal their identity.-Both main characters have -supposedly- high IQ's.-Yaoi jokes are commonly made about both animes. 
Main characters are totally the same: confident, clever and arrogant; both have supernatural power, fight for some sort of Justice and hide their true identity. And both have to cooperate with a girl they don't want to.The series are very similar too, a little like a chess game, although CG is less serious. 
An ""anti hero"" works for the supposed good of the innocent and weak, but using unjust means to bring down evil. 
Good-looking, intelligent anti-hero with a god-complex and aided by a beautiful ally. Both are blessed with a power to control people, they both have this mission to cleanse the world from the clutches of evil even if they have to betray their love ones. 
Like in Death note, there is a idden criminal that is a genius and on the same time they are the main character.You will see that in both, you see very skilfull plans.I think you will like 
The main reason why Code Geass and Death Note are compared so often is Light's uncanny resemblance to Geass's Lelouch. Both gain an ability by accident(or by fate if you want to call it that) that can change the world. Both are very intelligent, witted, manipulative, and have a twisted sense of justice that they attempt to justify. The main difference is that Code Geass has mechs and is a bit more colorful while in Death Note, Light is a bit more clever and emotional.(The cleverness factor is up for debate, as many people will argue that Lelouch is more clever than Light)  Another important key difference is that while Light is a more overall emotional character, he has almost no emotional attachment whatsoever to any other human.(His father was minimal and ultimately just a pawn in his game) Lelouch, is just as manipulative as Light, but does show a bit more of a charasmatic nature and his unconditional love towards his sister in the beginning of the show illustrates that perfectly.Another bonus of Code Geass is that it's ending and second season is MUCH better and well done then Death Note's. Overall, If you like Death Note, then you are almost SURE to enjoy Code Geass. Geass has a bit more humor and action, may not be AS psychological, but it's pretty damn close. read more 
Both are psychological animes, both have protagonists that have goals that they try and get to through means some dislike, you either love or you hate both protagonists, and both have their own harem moments.  
They're both about a guy that seems evil that is trying to repair the world in thought-out, strategic steps. 
Both with the protagonist obtaining a power that can kill or manipulate people. They both attempt to achieve ""world peace"" while they hide their identities from their friends, family, and the world. 
Code geusshas a very similar idea to Deathnote, both great show have similar use of Psychology to portray there intentions. Both incorperate a secretive ability they use to create change, both got theres abilities from a person thats immortalish, both abilities have strings attached. Same things happen to the main character at the end of the series. Both eppin shows (must see's in my opinion) GOGOGO! 
Two shows about teen geniuses attempting to alter the world, for the better of course, even if that requires swimming across a river of blood. Both end beautifully, and even after seeing them both several times, they bring a joyful tear to my eye with the elegant finallies. 
They both have intelligent main characters which obtain some sort of strange power  from abnormal people or creatures. They also have enemies who tries to take them down and the main character both have a secret identity like  death note : light=kira                Code geasse: lelouch=Zero  
Both the main characters play the role of the ""evil"" and they conceal their identities using a pseudonym. 
There both students who are tired of the world they live in and they get a special power with whom they use to change the world. They both get known with a certain alias across the globe making them famous and their real identity is unknown. This anime is SO similar.. seriously if you liked death note and vice versa. WATCH BOTH. 
Lelouch (Code Geass ) and Light (Death Note) both want to change the world with their special powers. The animes have the same kind of ''chess games'' going on. 
Both Death Note and Code Geass are very morally ambiguous, and focus on a main character that obtains a supernatural ability and, with that ability, deliberately demonizes himself in order to remake the world into a better place. Both anime are heavily reliant on the strategic interactions between the protagonist and antagonists to provide tension and rising action; both anime are more intellectual than action-oriented. Both anime also have fairly high production values, and though that's not necessarily the point, it is a nice plus. 
In both  main characters are gaining super power. They're trying to make world a better place at all cost. Light is very similiar to Lelouche. Both are sharp, logically thinking students, and they have aspiration to be God, instead of being students. 
[Similarities]1) The main character are protagonists bent on changing the world. 2) Both are assoicated perhaps with a bit of politics or businesses.3) There are limitations and rules of the two tools used in both this anime (deathnote and Geass)4) The personality and the intentions of the two main characters, Lelouch and Light, are similar.5) Rating wise, the Code Geass story plot, enjoyment, and suspense equals that of Death note6) The characters had possession over supernatural devices. 
It's another psychological thriller where a young man with high ideals gains power to change the world, both just great anime. 
Another good anime(not the manga) it is pretty much death note with mecha which sounds very weird but it works. 
Genius guys trying to create a ideal world with some unworldly help~!!!  
-Similar protagonist: Lelouch is smart, deceptive, and cunning like Light. He also seeks to make the world a better place through questionable means. Lelouch, however, is much more human than the cold emotionless ""Kira,""and has his weaknesses, making him a much more relate-able character. -Characters in general better than in DN: for me, only L and his successors really stood out (well, Light did too, but I didn't like him -.-)-Story won't let you go! Awesome plot twists/cliffhangers at end of many episodes that leave you wanting moreUnderlying story, however, is very different. -CG: More focus on action/strategy. Didn't see any mecha in death note-CG has high school comedy, DN has a darker tone though both are pretty dark-DN: abuse of power= bad. CG: powerlessness = bad.Both are awesome!!  read more 
Both anime are quite awesome. There is a guy who is very intelligent and thinks carefully about every move which he makes to achieve something. There are supernatural powers and both anime include death. 
The main characters on both series have the same impact and the impression of being evil, also world domination is another common point. Also there are supernatural factors and cute supporting characters.. 
Both Code Geass and Death Note features main characters who want to create a ""more perfect"" world by using their abnormal powers and amazing intellect. Also, the main characters from these series have an ""arch rival"" who thinks their way of accomplishing his goals is injust.  
Both pyschological, mindfuckery with ideology being twisted and the ultimate question if the end justifies the means 
In both anime the main character has a very strong sense of justice and wants to put a stop to the evil in the world. Both are also extremely smart and intelligent when it comes to fulfilling their goals. They both obtain a supernatural power given to them by equally supernatural people. Lots of drama, strategics, action, and good looking characters (especially CG) make these anime a definite on my must watch list.  
Both have an intelligent Protagonist that must conquer the world. Both story's have a-lot of hidden tricks and surprises and they both seem to keep you at the edge of your seat. 
Both Death Note and Code Geass is about a teenager who wants to change the current world with the help of a mystical power they posses and learn how to controll as the series continues!  
Both deal with an anti hero who wants to rule the world. They both have extra abilities that puts them over their rivals. And they're insane. Enjoy 
Both anime shows a intellectual person with supernatural power, who wants to create a world based on his own sense of  justice. 
Both shows feature situations that are compared to a chess match. In both shows the main character is one of the most intelligent students in the world and receives a power that may change the world from an immortal being, they get followers to help them reaching their goals of changing the world. Both shows have similar stories from beginning to the end. 
These two series have similar protagonist: Both Light and Lelouch are extremely gifted students, and both receive a mysterious power from a benefactor who always stays nearby. However, Code Geass's Lelouch's problem is that in the year 2017 the Holy Britainnian Empire invaded Japan, and Lelouch aims to remove them from power in order to create a better world for his younger sister, Nunnally. Great cast.In my mind, Code Geass= Death Note and Gundam put in a blender.A great series for fans of both! 
I think death note and code geass are alike because they both surround a young male lead who has great logic skills. Both lelouch and light want to change the world for the better. Both also attain a power that can help them in doing so;lelouch the power of geass and light,the death note. 
A genius teenage boy acquires a special power that he uses to try and change the world. This part is incredibly similar, but the rest is fairly different. If you want another show with the same premise, by all means, watch the other one. The actual feel for the shows is quite different, however. Death Note feels much more mature and darker than Code Geass, and Code Geass puts more of an emphasis on fanservice and the harem aspect. I personally think Death Note is a lot better, but it just depends which kind of show is more for you. 
Code Geass and Death Note are both shows of cunning brilliance to be able to out-think your enemy. In both shows the main characters have to stay a step ahead of the enemy to keep from being exposed. 
Watching one you just have to think about how much these are similar. Both are about mastermind boys with superpowers trying to make the world better or how they think it would be better. 
By the way of strategy to overcome your opponents. 
Both main characters share the goal of wanting to change the world. Both shows have suspense, action, and violence. 
The plot for both anime are similar- Both want to create a new and better world but are unable to until they encounter someone(CG)/find a book(death note) and receive the an unbelievable power, one to control anyone(CG) and one to kill anyone(death note). Despite the similarities in these animes i found code geass to be more enjoyable. Code geass has a somewhat complex plot and is somewhat hard to understand and is only enjoyable if you actually understand what's happening but if you can understand. Also watch the second season of Code geass- way better than the first season MUST WATCH!!!!!! 
Very close type of mind game(even though death note is better in it) where main character have a super-natural power with some restriction. 
Both feature extremely resourceful protagonists who hope to make the world a better place, and who have the cunning to do it. Both feature the use of strategy as a central plot element. The difference is that Code Geass doesn't go downhill. 
Light is a smart kid, ridding the world of 'evil' as he increasingly gains power.  Power that was handed to him by a 'supernatural force'. Lelouch is doing he same thing, but for different reasons. A lot of suspense and strategy on both parts. It keeps you thinking. 
Both series have main characters with genius like intelligenceboth series are about making the ideal world - code geass is making the ideal world by rebelling against britania and death note is making the ideal world by killing all bad people in the world. 
Main characters are very similar, same basic story, both very dark, and both have a never ending fight for justice 
If you love death note, you will love code geass - hangyaku no lelouch AND code geass hangyaku no lelouch R2 which is the sequel. Both of the series uses logic, and understanding. IT is both about using brains to take over something or some place. Plus there is a HUGE amount of suspense as yo uwill find yourself glued to your computer screen trying to find out what happens next. but, code geass isn't as dark and mysterious as death note, so WATCH IT 
Both anime include a deep psychological plot where the protagonist tries to establish his goal in order to change the world. Also, both protagonists have similar character traits in the sense that they maintain a alter ago known to the world while they hide their true personal identities as students, and that they both will do practically anything to achieve their goal even if it means to kill the enemy with their unknown supernatural power. 
Both series follow a strong-minded protaganist who has their own sense of justice and wants to create a better world. They both attempt to achieve this through supernatural means that they have been gifted with. The main difference between the two is that Code Geass is a mecha anime, whereas Death Note isn't. 
These 2 series are a lot alike. Lelouch and Light both find an amazing power, have kinda the same goal, they are both geniuses. The main difference is that while Death Note refers to the current world, Code Geass takes place in the future. In my opinion, Code Geass is actually even more amazing as Death Note!!! 
People who enjoyed Death Note should absolutely, without-a-doubt watch Code Geass and vice versa. They are similar both in plot, character development, tone, and even philosophical merit; and anyone who thoroughly enjoyed one should love the other. Both deal with protagonists who are essentially megalomaniacs, obtaining otherworldly powers from a supernatural being, which they then use to change the world to their liking. Both are considered to be highly intelligent and excellent liars, employing these tools to defeat enemies who believe their rules and goals to be immoral or against the status quo. Both characters employ aliases which become known worldwide, rarely revealing themselves even to their allies. A central and interesting theme in both of these shows is the struggle between an equal but opposite force which is manifested by a close friend/ally/rival. The bond between the two forces is perhaps the greatest factor that propels both plots forward, literally and emotionally.Both series, while being fast-paced to the point of addictiveness, deal with complex psychological and philosophical issues: specifically, should one person have the power (or use the power) to change the world for the better, especially at the expense of others lives and freedom. Since both of the characters of megalomaniacs, it complicates the morality questions even further and makes for very compelling plots and character development. read more 
Both protagonists are seeking to rid the world of evil, though being slightly evil themselves. Through contracts of sort, both obtain supernatural powers (Lelouch = eye, Light = notebook). Through their overpowering intelligence, both are able to plan out very successful tactics to achieve their goals. The protagonists have to lead a double life as a student, and have to high their identities from their friends, family, etc. 
Both of the leading characters want to do good things, but are a bit evil. Both want to change the world and make it good, and they get special powers to achieve that goal. Both are a bit comedic sometimes but have a very mature and serious story. There's a good message in both too. I really recommend to watch them! 
Both series feature a man trying to change the world with only his intelligence and one special ability. They both also have the same... theatrical sense. 
These are very similar as others have noted in particular the lead character, the strategic thinking, trying to outwit the opponent and so on. In terms of differences (since there are so many similarities), death note is closer to the ""detective"" genre whereas Code Geass is science-fiction. 
Both teenagers who are ""superior"" to their peers, who get a power in which they both try to make a huge change to the world. The only difference is Light yagami from death note is morally wrong while lelouch from code geass is doing it for the morally right reasons 
The first half of death note plotwise is almost identical. Only difference is that code geass maintains this great plot, whereas death note fades  
Both are extremely clever and intriguing. Both main characters are geniuses and attempt to fight evil (the rest of the world). 
Both character in the anime are smart as they think a lot. People around them assume they are good, but really they are evil killing people that get in their way. 
In both animes, the story is about a protagonist who is fighting for what the believe in which renders on most part more towards the darker side (more villainous side than most protagonist). In Code Geass, Lelouch is very similar to Light were they side on the dark side but because of the unique stories it binds us to actually support these villainous roles as it is almost a form of justice. Also some psychological/mind games are involved in both animes. Definitely a must watch anime if you loved Death Note. 
They have similar lead characters (Light Yagami, L and Lelouch) who are intelligent. They both involve mindgames between adversaries. They are both excellently well-scripted anime with a mind-boggling element of slow revelation of plot. 
Code Geass is essentially Death Note. Replace Light with Lelouch, The Death Note with Geass, Ryuk with C.C. and add more action scenes in fighting Robots. However, one thing differs and that is how both characters react to each their powers. While Light immediately believes in achieving a god complex with his power, Lelouch uses his power for good until the power corrupts him and the people around him. In my opinion, Lelouch becomes a more interesting character this way and more likable than Light, and I trust me I do like Light. 
The main characters are very similar with strategic thinking and have both a longing for changing the world mostly to what they think is right. The main difference between them is that one is a genius psychopath who is generaly evil but the other one is evil for the greater good. 
Death Note and Code Geass were have similarities due to darker, older teen audiences, supernatural power, and fighting for justice. Here is the example for characters.Lelouch (Zero) = Light (Kira) - Both were main protagonists, using alter ego and persona, using supernatural weapon (Notebook for Kira and Geass power for Zero), going for justice, they are anti-heroes, and also has younger sister.Suzaku = L - Both were antagonists, support for main protagonist, and well as 2nd main protagonist.C.C. = Ryuk - Both were working for main protagonist, they're using a power and spell, and they love their favorite food (Pizza for C.C. and Apple for Ryuk).Kallen = Misa - Both were love with main protagonist and serve for main protagonist.Unfortunately, both anime were banned in China due to offensively, inappropriate,  and possibly strong mature rating. read more 
Both protagonists experience a twist in their personalities after a chance encounter. Although the concept of technology and shinigamis are different, both anime also have to do with the power of the eyes. Both anime have a sinister mood, and both are epic. 
Death Note and Code Geass are must see for all those people who just started watching anime because both of them are just masterpieces. These animes are not about fighting each other with fists, its about thinking about a way to win, using others to achieve your victory. 
They have similiar protagonists, who both are intelligent and trying to make the world better place by using strong methods. 
Both of there stories have a main character that is young but extremely intellegent. At first Light wants to rid the world of bad people, but becomes a psycho-maniac. As with Lelouch he only wants to gives his diabled younger sister a fair chance in life, but soon realizes he isn't the only one with a good reason to fight The Empire of Britannia, but still he has his crazy moments too. 
Code Geass and Death Note are both about a high school student who is out to change the world for the better by using a mysterious power. However, Code Geass is more about politics and discrimination, while Death Note which is about crime. They are both excellent shows. 
En ambas historias nos presentan protagonistas estudiantes de diecisiete años con una inteligencia y una habilidad para pensar envidiables. De parte de un ser misterioso reciben un extraño poder anormal, con el cual, usando maniobras friamente calculadas, planean cambiar al mundo como se lo conoce actualmente, ocultándole a todos quienes son en verdad utilizando un pseudónimo y desafiando a la ley si es necesario. Durante el desarrollo de las tramas se conoce a otros personajes con este poder, y estos pueden ser tanto compañeros como enemigos. Y a pesar de que ambos protagonistas demuestran ser personas frias y decididas, llega el momento en que muestran su lado humano y podemos conocer sus sentimientos más profundos. read more 
They both have guys who think they are doing the right thing but really they're hurting the people around them. Also Code Geass is a little bit hard to I dont know, umm understand at the start.If you liked one you'll like the other :) 
They both have an antagonist,or whoever believes he's doing the wrong thing, as the main character thinking of ways to rule the world and get the want. The only difference is that code geass is based on more futuristic things like robotic machines and such compared to just a notebook. 
Both shows feature young men and their ambitions to change their corrupt worlds through morally questionable means bestowed upon them by the supernatural. 
Well both have facts about life which are true. The main characters in both are doing something that they feel is right, but not everyone thinks that way. Both Lelouch and Light has a girl following them.  
These two animes are similar because of the main characters who share the same villianous qualities. They both seem to want to create a better world with their new powers that they required, the Death Note from Ryuk and the Geass from C.C.Light and Lelouch's  names both start with a L :P and they seem to be very intelligent, planning every attack by using their pawns precisely. Both of them have their own followers and share a tight bond with at least one of them, Light and Misa and Lelouch and Kallen.Also they both appear to have their identity a secret with only a handful of people knowing and use a God-like name to be known as, Kira being Light and Zero being Lelouch. read more 
They both tell the stories characters trying to reach a similar goal.Both of these characters (Lelouch and Raito) have a special power and many obstacles in their way.Both are extremely entertaining masterpieces. 
The main character, Lelouch, is like Light from Death Note, but better (AKA he's not an asshole). Both protagonists are antiheros, both gain a unique power, and both are clever, popular, manipulative schoolboys.The whole series shares some themes with Death Note; 'what is justice?', 'what means are morally acceptable in a fight for the common good?', 'If you had a power to change the world, how far would you go?'.The main difference would have to be that Lelouch actually has feelings for his friends and loved ones, whereas Light is willing to sacrifice anyone and everyone at the drop of the hat. In addition, Code Geass is a mecha anime with more humor, a brighter color scheme, and (very little) eechi. Death Note is a detective show with a subdued color scheme and very little comedy. Another notable difference is that Light is a idealist and Lelouch is a realist; and on the other side we have L as a realist and Suzaku as an idealist.They're both thought-provoking shows that have you on the line between supporting the main character and supporting the people trying to take them down. If you liked Death Note I think you would enjoy Code Geass, and vice versa. read more 
Both anime are rather similar-the difference is that Light wants to save the world because he thinks it's rotting, while Lelouch wants to save the world for his little sister.And if Kira=Zero, and and Sayu=Nunnaly, then it all evens out!  
The plot is the same the main characters are both evil but the see as justice the both get powers in death note the guy get's a DEATH NOTE in Code Geass the guy get's a eye technique with both powers they kill the enemies and other people that is their justice. 
It concerns justice somehow. Also there's a protagonist that does different actions that differ to each person. Lelouch is Zero and Light is Kira, but know one knows their true identity except a few. 
Oddly enough, my discovery of Code Geass began with a magazine article comparing the two protagonists of Death Note and CG. The premise of these masterful series is completely unrelated, but the magazine devoted two pages that covered the similarities between the two main characters (Lelouch and Light), pointing out their overzealous behaviour, wicked intelligence, and anti-hero themes. Top tier anime at its finest. Brilliant plots, well written characters, and critical acclaim are what you'll find in both anime. Hell, the desire to bring viewers to both shows inspired me to make my first recommendation!Enjoy. 
Code geass and death note are increadibly similar.The star of the show is an anti-hero meaning his goals are good but his methods are harsh and crude altough i think that lellouch wasnt that much evil because he was doing evrything for his little sister and his way of always protecting the weak and you cant change the world with out alot of deaths as many people know.In death note however the main character tries to become god simply because he is twisted thats the difference between character and plot also dont let the fact that there is meccha in code geass lead you to believe that you will not like it because i cant watch anything with meccha in it but code geass is still my favourite anime, read more

Its fast-pace intense story about a high school boy who gets a power, and is determined to change the world.  
Both of the main character start with being a normal high school student but later on got the power to change the world as they want it. They are rebelling against something, in code geass it's against Britain. And in Death Note the police and the law. Both got a evil laugh and i bet that you will really like both show. 
The two main male characters think their act is justice, while they both have a rival to compete against their opinions. Also there are other similar characters. 
Both series are suspensful and have a main character that is trying to obtain ultimate power to control the world or people in some way or form. In Death Note, it was through the power of the Shinigami. In Code Geass, it was through the power of Geass granted by C.C. Although one takes place in everyday life and another is supposed to be set in the future, both have a similar concept and structure. 
The main characters on both Death Note and Code Geass are extremely smart and it seems as though they are playing a big game of chess. On Code Geass the main character is pined up against everyone else except for the people he can manipulates just like in Death Note but in Code Geass he has a SUPER POWER that helps him with some of his manipulation. 
This anime is in every single aspect SO SIMILAR(!) The comparison between the two is just unbelievable.Death Note's main character has the heroic kind of personality, hiding under a fake name and bestow justice upon the world with a supernatural power.THE SAME happens in Code Geass: *possible spoiler* the main charater also obtains a supernatural power, creates a fake person as his cover and bestows justice upon the world. Well, in this case, upon Japan.They both are hindered by an organization, and in both animes, you also see big parts of dialogue and progression of the story of both sides. In both of them the main characters have to avoid/defeat the opposition by thinking very tactically, in which both are very skilled.But the main reason they are so similar is in critical situations, the ambience, the reactions, the story, it makes you shiver in anxiousness.I experienced this feeling first whilst watching Death Note. It actually scared me a bit, but it was just so awesome, it cannot be described by words, well at least I can't describe it ;p.When I started watching Code Geass, the exact same feeling rose up again, and it told me: ""This anime is going to BLOW YOUR MIND"".I have not finished Code Geass yet at this moment, but I'll say this: If you watch these two, you'll be statisfied with anime for at least a month.Have fun an thanks for reading this! ^^ read more 
•both have a main protagonist who follow a childish notion, by their own means of 'justice'•both main characters are very intelligent in the way they contradict their enemies, when they are eliminating evil, to create a better world.•both follow paths that lead them will lead you into angst/agony/ and a sense of realism/aswell as empathy for the characters as the story progresses through hardships and meltdowns, to romances, aswell as destruction.•both animes have beautiful OST's to accompany the emotional heart wrenching ups and down, giving the audiences feelings of sadness, to being courageous and even rooting for the main protagonists sense of justice•both animes see the bitterness of life and how harsh reality can be, as everyday life goes 1 day at a time, the worlds hatred on minorities, high ranking status's of people with power, to the poverty of others and how one loves JUSTICE, •they are very similar in a brilliant genius is creating a new world, for people to live in, away from a status pyramid, where everyone is the same and should be treated with respect. if you love one, you will love the other. read more 
Both involve one man and his desire to change the world for the better through the use of a single, simple power.Though the powers are simple, the plot is very complex.  
Both series have a compelling plot and an interesting anti-hero as a main character. While Code Geass focuses more on action, Death Note focuses more on the story itself. Both series are highly recommended, but I'd say go for Code Geass if you prefer fantasy and action, and Death Note if you want something more dark and realistic. 
Both have similar premises in that a high school student gains superpower and want to use it to change the world. For viewers who love watching shows that feature a smart, charismatic male lead gaining a super power and outsmarting his opponents at every turn, using complicated tricks, these are great.There are some key differences between them, though. Whereas Lelouch in code geass is an anti-hero, Light in Death Note is an anti-villain. Whereas code geass feature a world at war, death note portray a world that at first glance looks peaceful but infested with crimes of all sorts.  
Both animes have characters with brilliant minds dueling and many psychological games. 
Teenage masterminds who try to carry out what they think is justice and who lose themselves in the process. Both Light and Lelouch struggle to make the world share their view, while fighting either a super detective or an entire nation. Will the masterminds succeed in justifying their extreme actions, or will they lose to insanity? Both anime are psychologically very interesting and the plans these two scheme will leave you mind-blown at times. Definitely worth watching! 
Both main characters are smart, popular students, they receive a special power and with that power they try to change the world into a better place 
It has similar strategy elements and also very good characters, although there is fighting in code geass, which is completely different to death note. 
Both series revolve around a main character who wants to make the world we live in a better place. They both achieve a certain 'power' that helps them to achieve this goal. The battles in both series are based on deep tactical planning. The main character is borderline crazy and will do anything to achieve his life long goal. They will have you drop your jaw at how smart they are and surprise you every episode. 
If you love Death Note and couldn't get enough of it and wanted more then Code Geass is the better version of Death Note. Not saying Death Note is bad cause it's pretty epic but Code Geass has that too smart to be true lelouch. He just like Light but he has the power to control a person's actions. Lelouch goal like Light goal is to create a world of peace. It's epic to the very end and will keep you guessing how is he going to get out of this. 
Both of main characters gain the power of destroy others, anonymously. They first do it for ""justice"" but then, you know.. 
The exceedingly intelligent protagonists of both series act in order to create a better world for those around them—mainly their younger sisters—and utilize supernatural powers in the process. Though both have distinct motivations, their primary intentions are, at their roots, selfless. One of the most notable connections that can be drawn between the two series is their chess game format. Chess is a motif present in both CG and DN; in each storyline, developments are often viewed as part of a giant game. Twists, traps, and deceptions pervade the conflicts in both series, and both Lelouch (Code Geass) and Light/Raito (Death Note) assume chessmaster roles.Code Geass and Death Note each evoke their own questions of social justice, presenting two main sides that clash to protect their notions of integrity. Among these questions is the ubiquitous ""Do the means justify the ends?"" The series share the refreshing depiction of unorthodox viewpoints as being as worthy of acknowledgement as socially acceptable ones. Though it can be argued that objectivity fades as the episodes progress, in neither case is there a concrete definition of ""wrong"" or ""right"" forced upon the audience. As well, neither protagonist, despite his major role, is morally infallible. read more 
Code geass Is really similar to Death Note. You look from the ""Villain's perspective"". Both of the protagonists hides their real identity, and has a similar goal.  
Both anime have similar male leads and both heroes are very intelligent  
Both focus on an intelligent, popular, high school character who upon receiving supernatural powers seek to change the world and enforce their own kind of justice whilst also trying to keep their identity secret.They also have about the same number of episodes. 
Both have the same style of story. The story is told from the side of the villain, decision making and development of both series is very similar. 
Both protagonists are arguably closer to villains than actual antiheroes and are basically trying to take over the world through the mystical power given to them and ass pulls. Their respective show's entertainment value comes mostly from the thrill of seeing what new way they'll utilize to use their power to deceive and utterly humiliate their antagonists. 
Similar plotBoth protagonist are getting rid of someone/something without revealing his/her identityBoth with a special gift 
the plot is the same = both heroes use their supernatural powers to change the world.the ""friends"" of the two heroes are their worst enemiesThe plot is revived when both characters lose their memory.the two heroes realize that they are not the only ones to hold this power. 
Death Note and Code Geass definitely bring a lot of differences to the table, but they have very similar feels, particularly when it comes to the often frantic cat-and-mouse aspects of the shows. Also, the respective plots of Death Note and Code Geass hinge on the existence of a supernatural power (or object with supernatural power, in Death Note's case) which further makes them comparable 
Character us kind of crazy like in death note. Both characters also really smart. Both kind of got a mind fuck sort of thing going on(death note much more though) 
Both have a main character which is extremely intelligent, and is trying to use a new power they acquired to change the world in their own way.   
they both want to create a utopia..they have supernatural powers given by a powerful entity..both have mind games that makes you think..the protagonist is seen as evil... 
I've seen this anime recommended here before, but I thought I'd recommend it anyways.They are both similar because it's about someone trying to change the world. They both have or use supernatural powers, and that leads to corruption of themselves. Both the protagonists of the story have original good intentions, but are doing it in a immoral way.  
Both has the most FAMOUS anti-heroic protagonists. And they been compared countless of times. The argument of ""who's better"" is still very much alive even after so many years had past since the ending of both series. 
Lelouch and Kira are in the same intellectual level and look for similar things: changing the world (but wich one in a unique way). Both story are of  high quality level and are well thought. And Code Geass (in many people's opnion) to surpass Death Note in drama and emotion. 
1) Both of these have male characters who believe themselves to be Gods.2) Both use strategies to figure out problems or get what they want.3) Both become friends with people they need to so they can use them later on.4) Both are highly intelligent.I think they have some similarities, and though I definitely loved one more than the other, they are both worth watching at some point! 
Both geniuses. Both do justice ... Or at least claim that .. Even you do not know which side to choose.Both are fascinating, and both have amazing ways to win, and they always do unexpected actions.Just trust me and believe me, if you love one of them, you will love the second.The only difference is that in Code Geass there is more action. 
These both have a very smart protagonist that plan a lot. This isn't the only recommendation for this so I won't go into detail. The main difference is that while Code Geass centers around someone who looks evil being good (he's basically conquering the world) Death Note has someone who looks good doing evil (murdering people). I could go into more detail (the statement above is basically wrong) but then I would be spoiling stuff. 
Light is very much like Lelouch, both are geniuses with darker streak, both enjoy viewing people as chess figures in their grand game and both pay a price for it. 
They both have intelligent main characters that have been gifted a super-natural power.  
Death Note is very similar to Code Grass in that they both have a very intelligent protagonist who has the ability to manipulate people in order to achieve their goals. They are both very great and I recommend them to everyone.  
The most obvious recommendation of them all. Both have main character with superpower with some important flaws. Light and Lelouch have similar personalities, they both want to accomplish their ultimate goal no matter the cost, but Light is more radical. Death note´s quality drops in the second half, which is a shame and a reason why i enjoyed Code Geass more, but they are both worth the watch. 
Both series have story about main character being criminal and student. Both of them want to create a new world that would be better (from their perspective). The most similar thing is about how they execute their plan for building a new world. 
Both shows feature a strong, powerful and ingenious main character (Light and Lelouch) who wish to change the world for the better, but eventually get drunk on their power and fail because of their own ambitiousness. Both are also set in a less realistic version of our world, in which the protagonist has some unusual power which allows them to control the actions of another human being. Murder, mystery, mendacity and manipulation are prevalent elements in both. Also, though the shows may be unrealistic, the characters are excellent; strong, believable, real and very relatable. Although Code Geass has more violence and action than Death Note, the similar dark themes, brilliant plot, and strong characters (who I grew very attached to, very quickly) kept me absolutely riveted to the screen while watching. If you like Death Note as much as I do, Code Geass ideally should be next on your plan-to-watch list.  read more 
Both a battle-of-wits anime.Both Lelouch and Kira (Light) have some sort of special ability to cleanse the world of evil. But they turn out to be like the antagonist.Both animes are unusual for Shounen- seeing that they focus on out smarting the other instead of fighting. 
Both anime resolve around two characters that use their power to manipulate people around them. Both have a goal of changing the world to what is best in their mind. 
The main characters are very similar. They both get an unique power. They want to eliminate the unrighteousness in the world in their own way.The both series are very unpredictable and exciting. 
Both series have several geniuses that wage a psychological war against each other with grand goals in vision. Both set of characters happen to be possibly the most clever characters in all of anime. 
Death Note is about a man that gets a gift that will allow him to change the world for the better.He is a super-genius (gets 100% for University-level tests without trying)Code Geass also stars a super-genius man with a new power that'll allow him to change the world. There is a very slight similarity in their ability.Both animes are brialliantly written (Death Note somewhat better, though) and I personally am attracted to intelect. 
Code Geass and Death Note are similar in one way: A complex, riveting storyline with minimal room for romance. A lot of strategy and guesswork is involved. 
Mind games are important part of the both series.Main characters are both ultra-smart students with a unique supernatural power and trying to change the world with using substitute idol characters while they are staying behind the scenes. They both sacrifice their present and future in order to change the world. 
Both of them have protagonists who are anti-heroes that try to shape the world but use unfavorable means of doing so. 
they have lot of things in common but the most important things are that the heroes' community think they are representing the evil but indeed they are building the justice by their own ways , other one is that their precious people are standing in their way (actually they don't know about that) but light and lelouch handled them as a roadblocks and removed them .finally , i thought these 2 points make them so similar , so who love one of them , surely will love the other one . english isn't my first language , so excuse any mistakes . hope you found it helpful , Jana ^^ read more 
Within both series, the main protagonists (Lelouch and Light) both attempt to achieve to ""save"" their country from its corruption.Both involve psychological turns and major mind games that'll leave you in suspense. 
In Death Note, one of the most obvious and enticing elements are the mind games played between Light and L, and Light and Near.  This is also found in Code Geass, which not only brings these mind games to the table, but introduces them on an empirical scale-- literally! 
Both feature insanely intellectual main characters, and feature intellectual meta-game chess-like plots. 
The mains caracters of these two animes are both very intelligent and inherits of a huge power they will use for their own visions of justice  
There is quite a great deal of overlap between the two series. Both start of with a guy who by some means aqcuires the power to change the world. Both of these guys fall into the category of characters that are far from the good guy, but you will end up rooting for anyway. The amount of mindgames is huge in both Death Note and Code Geass. If you liked any of those aspects about Death Note, particularly that last one, then you will definetly enjoy Code Geass as well. 
Lots of strategizing and thought processing. Differences: Code Geass has mechs and is near-future-ish, Death note's MC is a normal guy. 
If you took Death Note and gave it action, it would be Code Geass. Two insanely smart guys out to change the world with a god like power that was given to them. Thinking 20 steps ahead of their opponent as if they are playing chess. Both with moments of comedy and specks of insanity. At the end of both you will sit there thinking ""wow, what really just happened??"" or y'know more like me lying on the floor freaking out. 
Both male main characters start off as regular teenage boys until they possess the power; either the notebook or geass. The plot is very similar too, as their main goals is to change the world into a better place.   
Both animes main character are very intelligent and both are very similar to each other. Both characters contain some kind of special power, and are trying to change the world by facing enemies that are close to them. 
These 2 Shōnen anime are very similar in many respects. The main characters both receive a controversial power from an unknown being.The both try to purge the world of evil, acting on their own ideas of justice and equality.The main characters both have a secret alias; Zero and Kira.All in all, Code Geass and Death Note are very similar and are must-watch anime series!I AM A FUCKING WEEABOO 
Death Note reminds me of Code Geass because of its intense emotions and the constant twists and turns the plot takes. It excludes certain events until they actually play apart in the overall scheme and it always keeps you guessing. It is also very cool to watch Light and L's minds work and plan 50 steps ahead just like Lelouch.  
I believe you would like Death Note because even though the plot is totally different, it has similar aspects to Code Geass.  They both present the stories of antiheroes - good guys who are trying to change the present world into a better world, while at the same time trying to hide the fact of who they are.  Both must face ordeals on their path toward their goals.  
Light and Lelouch are exactly the same; both MCs fight for what they believe is true justice. The strategies used in both are complicated and give the series a nice touch which makes them so enjoyable. 
Both have the premise of strategy. Both Protagonists are kid geniuses. Both have special powers. 
-Young intelligent school boy comes across a mysterious ""power"" and uses it to try and change the world-Ideologies and morals tackled in various ways-The ""power"" when described feels very real, little detail left out giving it a suggestion of possibilities-Although Code Geass uses Mechs, just like Death Note large amounts of intelligence is used, isn't just brainless fighting  
Both animes contain a smart and nice student which is the main character. Both characters obtain a power and they will try to change the world with it. They will both use a nickname to protect their identity. 
Lelouch and Light are one and the same. They receive super-natural powers to enable them to embark on a journey to seek justice. Only Geass is explosive, about shooting/smashing everything and over-the-top Hollywood tactics all day, while Death Note is more thoughtful and down to Earth.Would recommend Death Note over Code Geass any day, but for any who've already seen one watching the other is certainly not unthinkable. 
Both animes count with an unexpected complex history, two of the best animes I have saw ever. The two have also one important aspect for me: the main character is one of or the most powerfull one in the serie. They are kind sympathetic and are much inteligent. Anyway, you should watch both and take your conclusions, personally, both are just epic. 
Cocky narcissist receives super power with limitations that enables him to try to take over the world. Shenanigans ensue for both series and the ladies love both protagonists. In both series the protagonist is an anti-hero too 
I know these two series are recommended to death but it's not just the popularity that sets them together. Code Geass borrowed significantly in the wake of Death Notes popularity. The main character's in both series share similar motive and battle their opponents on a strategic level that is above most people. 
Very intelligent high school student Being granted with supernatural powers and using this power to change the world and not merely their surroundings... even if it means to use dark and wrong means to achieve this dream... this is the main theme for both of these stories.Despite the time set difference I believe that anyone who enjoyed watching one of these psychological thriller then he will enjoy watching the other, the main protagonist of both series have much similar points and there's a lot of duels of wits and sharpness. 
for people who like thrilling anime where the protagonist controls everything!! 
Both have smart Main Character where both have special powers. [Death Note & Geass]Both can manipulate the way of death/Control people with their powers.Both main characters are trying to change the world to be better place. Of course on their on perspective. Fighting for justice. 
The characters are similar in the sense that they're bother very intelligent and have an ability which makes them more superior than others. In both shows they're trying to change japan in one way, in code geass it's all about trying to free japan from britania while in death it's about creating a perfect uthopia. These two animes also show the darker side of people as both light and lelouch are not pure of heart and will do dark things if necessary to achieve their goal. 
Both shows are full of suspense, death, emotion, and include a genius character who doubles as a ""bad"" guy. Both had me on the edge of my seat every single episode. 
The main character is very similar to Light as they are both too smart for their own good, have a supernatural power that they used to ""take over the world"", they both want to make the world a better place and they are also massive chick magnets. They both have amazing soundtracks and characters with plot twists that you will not see them coming. Code Geass is basically Death Note with Mechas.  
Together with Death note, Code Geass were the first animes to catch my attention when I was reommended by a friend to start watching anime.This anime is highly regarded by many, as one of the best animes ever made, and that is completely justified. It's story and the characters are carrying the series perfectly, but what really sets this anime (Deathnote as well) appart from all the others, is the strategic mind of Lelouch. He is a genius, you can't avoid having to pause once in a while to catch up with the amazingly complex thought trail of Lelouch.I highly recommend Code geass. To the new, and the experienced anime watchers. It will not disappoint.Death Note is a series I didn't really finish. Once one of the characters died, i stopped, but I intend to watch through the last part once I get the time.The part of it I did watch, had some simularities to Code Geass, in the psycological aspect. Light is a character that's really hard not to admire, he is a strategic genius, and the series overall is a masterpiece. read more 
Based upon the intellectual capabilities of the main characters and each main character has a unique power that they can use. 
Both are very focused on strategies. Lots of mind games. The main character seems to be evil and his “rival” is in the justice/lawful side. 
As well as Death Note, Code Geass's story revolves around a highschool kid who suddenly obtains a power that will allow him to achieve his most desired thing, in this case world peace( and something else but no spoilers).If you liked the way that Light and L seemed to always be one step ahead of each other and continuously ""defeat"" each other, then you will like the way Lelouch(the main character) makes strategies, because, well, it is pretty much the same way of thinking.And last but not least, both of these anime have that soundtrack that makes any normal activity look awesome, just like chapter 1 of death note when Light starts writting all those names. read more 
Both the animes are for intellectual people with a lot of strategies and brainwork.You will find similarities in the lead role of both animes too. 
'Code Geass' and 'Death Note' are both what I refer to as strategist's animes.They both include an individual, very smart for their age, as the main protagonist. They both appear to be good, but with an evil side to them, and this is why these animes are both impressive.I found that both animes had me guessing the strategies and plans that the characters had put up, trying to get past them, but failing miserably, due to the gargantuan plot twists.Both animes have an art style that I love, and develop each character very well.I would wholeheartedly recommend both animes and the sequel to 'Code Geass', which takes off at a seemingly impossible point.  read more 
Pretty easy to notice the comparison if you've seen both animes. Main character in both shows has an ability/power to manipulate/eliminate their enemies, aiming to make a better world. 
This is an obvious comparison, but not for the reasons most people belive...The thing most similiar thing about them is their pace. In every epiosde there is something happening, there is a lot of action (both mental and physical) and the dialogues are very fast; because of that, not a second is wasted. The tension between two opposing factions is almost continouslly present which builds the dynamic even further. After you have finished an episode, the next one demands to be watched. The second thing very similiar is the main character's usage of other people as his pawns as a mean to victory/salvation and the main character's vision of creating a better world or an utopia for worthy people.Both series quoestions what is right and what is wrong and if the end justifies the means, as well as other controversial topics like - should all human lifes be measured equally.If you liked Code Geass, you will probably like Death Note, but maybe not vica-versa, because the atmosphere in the two is different. While Death Note has a lot darker and gothic feel to it while Code Geass' athmoshepre is more revolutionary and, well, more colorful to say at least.(I avoided watching Code Geass because of the art style and the mech genre, but later when I decided to give it a shot I realised the charm of the anime and it quickly became one of my favorites.) read more 
Both shows involve a teenage boy with supernatural powers for their own advantage. Both shows involve the main character trying to take over the world and try to make it better. 
It isn't strange that two anime (CG and DN) are compared together forever because both followed about the high intelligent and hot bishounen  hero that  are very ambitious and badass to conquer the world and both guy are legend of badass magnificient protagonists all times. 
-both have male leading characters- both given something to control people- both are very powerful people- both are very smart, sly and very cunningLelouch and Light both want things to changeboth have a destruction into creation ideaboth get a power from something paranormal/ out of this worldThey have different endings thoughThey both basically play it out like a game of chess 
In both series the main character is a very intelligent student in Japan. They receive supernatural powers and get a supernatural companion. Since they're dissatisfied with the world as it is, they take the initiative with their new opportunities. They want to create a new world order. In this case both assume a pseudonym and to hide their identity, they are lying and lonely. In order to achieve their goals both main characters become morally questionable. 
Both have similar main characters. Both have similar situations given to the main characters. If you liked any of the characters, you'll most likely like the characters here as well. They both have somewhat similar abilities and rely on their intellect. 
Both involve a boy who is granted a 'power' that gives him an unfair advantage to help achieve his goal. Both shows have the main characters trying to outsmart their rivals and use their new powers to control the world. 
Code Geass is really similar to Death Note.Both have similar nature. Main characters have special powers (geass and death note). They want to be like a God and be justice. They make 'justice' with their powers. They must hide their identity. They are known in the world. 
Code Geass: Hangyaku No Lelouch, despite its unique animation, shares a lot of similar aspects to that of Death Note such as both of the following series have main protagonist that uses special power in order to conquer and lead the world to a better and peaceful place. Light, Yagami uses Death Note to support his goal while Lelouch, Lamperouge uses the power of Geass. They both not only uses their attained power but also are very intelligent which enables them to use tactics and plans to counter their foes while hiding their own identity simultaneously.Both of the series also have a lot of sad, yet beautiful moments with great soundtracks which makes a show 'Master Piece'. Thus, Code Geass: Hangyaku No Lelouch is 'Ideal Recommendation' for Death Note so why not give it a shot? read more 
lelouch and Light both have the same narcistic intelligent kind of i'm always 5 steps ahead of you attitude.of course in both franchises there were times when they panicked and needed to recollect their thoughts so it wasn't like it always worked out for them but they both strongly resemble each other apart from the fact that they are in completely different stories with a completely different concept.the plot is comepletely different except for certain situations wich also require the same deduction skills light has.both anime are really wel done animation quality wise aswell as story telling.i strongly reccomend both 
Both involve schoolboys bent on creating a perfect world using an supernatural artifact (or power, in the case of Code Geass) to aid them in their goal.Couple things to note about Code Geass: it's a mecha series and it also has a second season, Hangyaku no Lelouch/Lelouch of the Rebellion R2. 
Light and Lelouch are practically the same character. Both shows feature quite a bit more intellectual, and both main characters have very similar personalities and abilities. 
Both of these anime begin with a highly intelligent main character who is in high school. In both of these anime, the main character starts out with a very pessimistic view of the world, and hate the way it works, and when they are given supernatural powers, try use them to create their idea of a perfect world.  
Both main characters are similar in that they both receive powers and then aim to better the world with them although through violent means, they are neither protagonists nor antagonists, rather they are somewhere in the middle. They both also have two people facing of against each other even though their goals are the same; they just have different methods. 
Well, the main characters are similar, the story is a bit different, but we see a main hero fighting his friends and becoming a greater evil to defeat the current evil in the world. 
Both protagonists lead a double life, with both sides of the coin  differing dramatically from each-other; on one side you have the seemingly perfect high schooler, while on the other there lies an ambitious genius with overarching plans for everything and everyone. The world is their chess game. Some people are just too smart for their own good... 
-Both are anime in which the protagonist is a genius and that is his greatest weapon to achieve his goal -Although Code Geass has elements of Mecha the anime is not focused on that but on war. -Both manage to obtain a supernatural tool for themselves and use that tool to achieve their goals. -Light Yagami (Death Note) and Lelouch (Code Geass) are in the top 5 of the most intelligent characters in the history of anime without a doubt. 
Both of the protagonists inherit an amazing power and start trying to change the world. They think they're doing the right thing, but there are two opinions on the matter.  
A show with a genius protagonist who gains powers and uses these powers for their own personal goals.  
Well written characters and plot with the protagonist being a mastermind character. The difference is setting, with Geass being more futuristic with a different atmosphere than Death Note. If you like one, you'll definetly love the other. 
Both have strategist anti-hero protagonists granted with powers to change the world, rivalry, and plot twists. Too good 
Similar characters with a cold, dark air about them. They both put up facades to how they truly feel and act, both kill in extraordinary ways, and have a special ability, and a female partner.similar feel to the anime (if you truly watch anime you know what I mean) 
Its similar due to the fact that both main characters really think a lot and they're both smart. Another one is both are fantasy type, and both uses there heads to come up with plans to transition to their next phase. 
- Watching both of them I had similar feeling- Both of them are masterpiece- Lelouch and Raito are very smart, powerful and serious- Both of main characters have got powerful weapon. Lelouch - geass and Raito - death note- Lelouch and Raito have got ''support""- Lelouch and Raito want to change the world 
This recommendation is probably a cliche.Smart protagonists possessing special powers make their attempts to change the world with good intentions while not being afraid of getting their hand dirty. A little similar atmosphere and these are the most popular anime. Both give an awesome and incredible impression. 
Both shows are about insanely intelligent protagonists simply attempting to take over the world in their own unique ways.  They also both have a quality dip in the second half.   If you looking for a show to make you think, these are the two best picks. 
If one were to watch both of these series around the same time, it would be impossible NOT to notice the similarities. A brilliant, bored teenager gains a supernatural power that allows him to finally accomplish his lofty goal, through any means necessary. Light and Lelouch are both such similar characters, but at the same time differ as the series progress. 
they are both a lot like each other because there both hero is anti hero that uses a lot of tactics and his brain 
This seems to be a very common recommendation; and with good reason. Both main characters ( Light + Lelouch) are unusually intelligent people, and are both in high school. They both want to change the world for 'the better' although for two very different reasons. In both anime there are many deaths involved as well, as in both anime -SPOILERS- there are main characters who kick the bucket. Also, both anime are very well known are respected in the MAL community. Finally, they are great starter anime for those who aren't so knowledgeable with anime in general. 
Both involve intelligence duels instead battles with just brute force where the smarter and better strategist wins and both have stories with protagonists very intelligent and cold trying to create a new world of peace, regardless of what may need to do to reach your goal. 
Both animes involve someone, more intelligent than most, and their psychological outthinking and prowess. Although one is situated in a much more modern setting as opposed to a futuristic one, the idea of destruction as a form of creation is existant in both. However, the endings and the fate of the individuals differ, and the winners and losers are different.  
Same plot style and intense pshycological battles  
Both series have those unexpected and mindblowing moments, and both maincharacters have the same ideal: they think the world as it is at the start of the serie is rotting. They want to change something about that by using something supernatural. The twists in Code Geass are some way similar to those in death note; like a game of chess. In both series the maincharacters make their foes powerless one by one... 
These anime share several traits, as narcissistic ""geniuses"" inhabit a world populated with idiots gain chuunibyo-like powers and go on maniacal killing sprees, mistaking murder and/or revenge  for ""justice"", manipulating those around them into helping fulfill their self-centered power fantasies. Full of overblown drama that 13 year olds love, completely unlikable characters, a panoply of plot holes, and absurd plot twists, both were made by excellent studios (Madhouse/Sunrise) that can make even the most ridiculous story lines become revered.Both anime are far longer than they need to be.Each has also supplied its fandom with a smorgasbord of yaoi fanart.If you loved one you're bound to worship the other as wellAlso: Pizza, apples, tennis and cat chasing.This recommendation has been done to death, but I thought I'd put it in a different perspective. read more 
Light and Lelouch both have a unique way of thinking and dealing with certain events. They both are both very intelligent and strategic and have a supernatural power that works in favor for them. Both of them  seem to fall into the role of the villain rather then a hero.  
They are both about students who were granted special power and the story of them trying to change the world and make it a better place.  
Similarly to Death Note, Lelouch Lamperouge (Code Geass) is the main protagonist who uncovers the power of Geass to force other to obey his orders against their will. The biggest difference between both shows is the Code Geass is set in a utopian world where Britain rules most of the world, while Death Note is set in modern day Japan. Code Geass is filled with similar story-telling elements Death Note is know for, such as clever and complicated story-telling, a suspenseful atmosphere, and plot twists and turns that will have you watching for days.Personally I prefer Code Geass over Death Note, because Code Geass tells a better story and rewards a loyal watcher of the series with a fantastic ending, which Death Note heavily lacked. read more 
The reason why Code Geass is similar to Death Note, is probably mostly due to the protagonists themselves. Both protag. have a special ability that none around them have, and they are determined to use the ability to do what they think is 'right', but however they are considered 'the villian' in the show by other characters. Both protag.  also have to struggle between school life and their plans, while also keeping their identity a secret. 
Well, you'll see this line everywhere in the world wide web: ""Watch Code Geass when you like Death Note""and yes, they really have some similars, for example the personality from the Main Character or the obtained superpower from a mystical essence.But at all they have more differences then common parts. The Main Plot is in the most way completely different and the location, presentation and plotting as well.Go ahead and watch both shows when you liked the MC but don't think the story is just copy and paste. 
1.Lelouch the Code Geas and Light from Death Note are very similar. The main characters, who are actually the bad guys, fighting for justice and a better world.2.Lelouch has a friend whom he had known 7 years, Suzuki ,and fighting against him, as well as a Light has L that are in some way, friends.3.Lelouch  had to kill their loved ones to make a dream come true, as well as Light. 
As Death Note, Code Geass has great focus on the physicological of characters and the characters will allways try to use the logic to reach their goals. If you're looking for something smart, whatch it. 
Both of these anime's have similar main characters who gain supernatural powers and use it to try and change the world. But due to this new power they begin to get corrupted and lose sight of their original goal. 
both anime are about a single person that uses supernatural abilities to try and change the world that they live in 
The main character on both shows are almost identical in terms of the way they think and how they want to change the rotten world they live in, and will go to any lengths to accomplish that goal even if it means going down a dark path.  Both characters are very smart but also very manipulative, they also have supernatural powers. These two shows are considered the best in anime and I'd recommend it to anyone. 
Death note has a genius main and has a similar feel, it is also about strange powers and world domination. 
These are both intellectual anime about a genius main character with help from a supernatural being to help them achieve their goals.  
The protagonists of these series are given special powers that they use to try to change and rule the world. They deceive and kill other people to get to this goal and may seem like arrogant, narcissistic, jerks. There is strategic thinking and you never know what's gonna happen next. They are both admired or hated by the world through aliases. The second season of Code Geass is much better than the first and not as hollow and boring as Death Note's second season, which was the reason for its downfall, in my opinion. In both, there is a lot of serious talking and a lot of strategy and tactics used to get rid of the protagonist's enemies. But in Code Geass, there is more action and fighting (since it is an anime about war). So if you're a fan of action and suspense, Code Geass is the right anime for you.  read more 
The main character is genius in strategies and tactics, and of course they are the most charismatic character of all anime's character. The challenges in both anime are great that make us can laugh because of their successful strategies.  
Both series feature a main male lead who are too smart for their own good, and use their wits and ""supernatural powers"" to outsmart the rest of the characters on this show. They also have very similar personalities, and can be seen as an ""anti-hero"" protagonist, one whom the viewing audience can root against. 
Both main characters get some kind of magical power they use to change the world. Lelouch tries to change the world into a place where his sister can live peacefully while Light tries to change the world into a place with no criminals, where he rules over everyone. These anime's can sometimes feel like a chess game because every thing they do gets consequences.  
Both protagonists are geniuses on a mission to make the world a better place while taking extreme measures, due to their newly acquired power. They both believe that they have to become evil in order to defeat evil. 
both have a mastermind main character trying to change the world. i highly recommend both.if you liked one of them, i can absolutely assure you that you'll like the other just as much.How ever code geass has a bit of science fiction and action while death note does have too much of that. 
Both shows share characters are given powers from outside sources (Shinigami/CC). This power allows for both main characters to strive for power. They give a perspective of viewing the world as an equation and rely heavily on strategies. They are both extremely well done and the endings are similar too. 
Both anime have intelligent main characters who fight their battles intellectually instead of having a superpower competition. In both anime, the main character is more of an idealist for a perfect world and will stop at nothing to achieve that goal, even betraying allies and sacrificing innocent people along the way 
Both main characters obtain a new power that allows them to attempt to change the world. Both main characters have very controversial ideals. If you liked death note then you'll love code geass  
Both protagonists think they are superior to the rest, using people as pawns to fulfill their ambitions. In addition, they have supernatural powers that help you control people's actions, as well as discard people when they don't need them. Two anime that catch you for the complicated situations with which the protagonists fight and their ways of dealing with them. 
The setting and the overall feeling of these shows are very different, but those two anime have a lot in common. Both series have intelligent main protagonists who are sick of society, and suddenly they find a super power that they use in order to change the world for their own reasons. Both of them are ruthless sometimes, but they are the best examples of anti-heroes, who are genious and think about plans that will blow your mind. Also, both anime have a political feeling and they are full of strategies and plot twists. 
To me, the main thing that connects these two animes is that the main protagonists are trying to make a better world according to their own opinions. In both Death Note and Code Geass, the main protagonists are very complex characters, with clear motives, sheer dedication, and are very intelligent. A few times whilst I was watching Death Note, the plot confused me and I was lost, but it was quickly resolved by an explanation by Light as to what he was doing/planning. This also happened to me in Code Geass. I got confused but Lelouch explained what he did and it blew my mind.  read more 
Pretty much the same concept, although Code Geass is more in a Japanese anime style. In more detail: both have an underrated main character that already shows some kind of brilliance from the start of the story. The real action begins however when they are offered a special power which turns them into the most overpowered character of their realm. Both end up backfiring and making our MC suffer. Even the side characters have similar traits and many of the same concepts are touched upon. The only thing death note definitely showed itself superior in to me, is the secondary main character/ antagonist. Whereas L of death note actually felt as a separate main character, of which you could completely crawl into his mind, follow his thoughts, feel his emotions and gave us one hell of a game (of opposites) with light, the antagonist of Code Geass felt less of real character to me. He seemed to be just an archetype, whose goal was to hinder our real main character and added way more annoyance than enjoyment for me. CG has more of an Japanese anime feeling to it rather than the more western looks of DN, with a more surreal setting and of course mecha. If you dont mind these you will probably enjoy both seasons of CG   read more 
Both consist of the main protagonist is an intellectual battle of strategy and planning. They each contain highly intelligent characters and a few plot twists to keep the story moving. Both endings are incredible and help tie up the stories. Much like Light Yagami, main character Lelouch appears to be more of a self-centered wannabe-ruler who wishes to recreate peace within the world, like Death Note. Each main character has a fantastical power to alter the world around them and attempts, with their increased knowledge, to bend people to their will. Death Note centers around the police while Code Geass centers around the military, both being similar working bodies in tactics and action. While Code Geass is infact a mecha anime and Death Note is not, the themes and character relations are very similar. Romance is not of the utmost importance in either anime, but the main character does use the theme to his advantage is both. Overall, if you like the themes of questioning justice and fighting through mental tactics, then these animes will fit rather well. read more 
Both anime is similar because:-Both main characters both obtain something that could be used to change the world.-Both main characters are really smart.-There's people trying to figure out who the main characters are.-Both anime makes you think 
Similar plot line where Protagonists are tired of the way their world works and by the end of first episode they get the power they need to change it.Similar mastermind ""enemies"" to protagonists which try to take them down. 
Are you a fan of Death Note? Are you looking for an anime like Death Note? Many people recommend Code Geass when the topic of animes like Death Note comes up. While Code Geass is an amazing anime the similarities with Death Note are minimal (but it still definitely deserves inclusion).What Code Geass does offer is a mind game adventure between the Rebels and Empire (similar to that of Light and L). Along with plenty of suspense and plot twists that make you want to keep moving through the episodes (similar to that in Death Note).Code Geass is set in an alternative present that contains three separate superpowers fighting for control (Britannia, the Chinese Federation and the Euro Universe. The anime takes place after the conquest of Japan by the Britannia Empire which leaves the citizens without rights and freedoms.The story follows Lelouch Lamperouge and his sister (exiled Britannia royalty) as he tries to find the person behind his mother's murder. In the process he gains support and popularity amongst the Japanese rebellion.  read more 
Both follow a very intelligent protagonist who decides to face societies short comings, with their own 'ends justifies the means' way. 
Both the main characters are geniuses, bent on bringing justice to the world, in their own peculiar ways. And both these anime are masterpieces. 
If you want something like death note this is really the only anime for you! Death note is my favorite anime and I've been looking for show like it since I've watched it there are many similarities ie both give the viewer a choice of which of the 2 main characters  they want to win both give have genius protagonists both have protagonists use questionable methods for what they want...only difference is that death notes ending is ass. 
When I was watching these two I noticed many similarities. Both main characters are seemingly geniuses that are gifted with a power that lets them cure the ""corrupt"" world in their eyes. Another thing I found was both main characters tend to be very manipulative and bend situations to fit their plans. 
The extreme clever and intelligence of the main characters gets you to both root for them and feel their emotions. With their clever plots, its impossible to like one and not the other. Code Geass has much more action while death note is pure wit (which is excellent)And if you haven't watch either of them, tell me, what have you been doing all this time? 
If you liked the manipulation skills Lelouch had you will like the way Light acts to get what he wants. Both series have very strong main characters. The intelligence of the characters makes them seem godlike in the face of adversity but like Lelouch, Light also has his share of enemies. 
Everything is a chess game. That is the best way to describe these two animes. The MC's are smarter than practically everybody and they do whatever to attain their goals. Very suspenseful and two of my favourite animes.  
- it's difficult to decide what is right and what is wrong in these anime- the protagonists are trying to change the world they live in- newly acquired powers change their lives drastically- they use those powers to kill people  
Want to watch two people, two friends, secretly be enemies? Well these are your shows! Fantastic anti-heros make for twisted plots that you will leave you awestruck. 
Code Geass is political with a focus on military tactics as opposed to cat-and-mouse detective work.  But the show's protagonist, Lelouch, shares many similarities to Light, including his high intelligence, manipulative attitude, and ""the ends justify the means"" mentality.  Apart from Lelouch's granted power of persuasion, there are no supernatural elements to the show, making Code Geass feel a bit smarter and much more grounded than Death Note. 
Both series are very alike:-Both MC's are very intelligent-Both MC's wants to make a better world-Both series are psychological and have action-Both MC's have the same personality-Both MC's have special abilities-Both MC's sacrifice those close to them 
Both animes are based around a protagonist that obtains a magic power and uses it to take justice into his own hands. In both of them, there are battles of wits around the use of the power and keeping their identity a secret while maintining a ""normal"" life. I liked both of them, but I liked Code Geass more because I think it has a better ending 
This seems to be a pretty common comparison - probably because Light and Lelouch are practically the same character. Both shows feature quite a bit more intellectual sparring than your typical shounen fare, and both main characters have very similar personalities (they're closer to being villains than heroes) and abilities (ridiculously powerful but with prominent weaknesses that require careful planning to circumvent).   
Both main characters take on the ""antagonist"" role to cleanse the world of evil. Both MC's are very strong and especially Death Note have a very good character as opposing role to this plan. Death Note is a bit lacking in the 3rd part of the anime, and is mainly carried by the 2 opposing main characters, while side characters are somewhat uninteresting, while Code Geass have an amazing cast with a ton of interesting characters from beginning to the end.The music in both anime is also really great, but by now it should be no surprise that both of these anime is def worth a watch. read more 
The theme and feel of the show the are extremely similar. From the very beginning you can see that the main characters have similarities so there is really no point in spoiling major plot points for the sake of convincing you. If you enjoyed watching the main character of one show outwit his opponents every which way then this is a show you have to try. 
Both series have a ""not your typical"" protagonist, that obtains a certain power to change the world.The thrill in both series is to see how the strategy works out, and how this effects the other characters & story. 
Both have a lot of intelligence in parts of perssonagens , making envolvernte plot the beginning to the end 
A high school student is given a power, with that they decide to change the world into a better place, they both slowly form alliances and the people see them as heroes. 
Both animes has quite similar features. Death Note revolves around Yagami Light who uses a notebook called Death Note to kill people. While Lelouch Lamperouge of Code Geass use a power, Geass, which compels other people to obey him. They both witnessed what the world has come to and want to change it for the better at ANY cost and are willing to sacrifice anything for that cause. They both work behind the shadows and are two of the biggest anime masterminds/puppet masters. A mysterious being aids them in their path to success. Their enemies are L Lawliet and Suzaku Kururugi, who wants to change the world through the ""System"" and condemns Light and Lelouch's ways. Both Light and Lelouch are high school students who wants to bring peace to the world but their ways are ""extreme"". Moreover, DN and CG, both are one of the highest rated animes in MAL. read more 
-both main characters have the same goals-it's set in world where there are a lot of crimes -both main characters hide ther identity -and both are smart animes 
I believe that these two animes are the best. When all action/op fails The Brains get the spotlight....Both the story begin with college students i.e Leouch Lamperouge and Light Yagami.Both the mc may look handsome caring and helpful .....but keep in mind they have an equally cunning,cruel,sadist,seaming,evil side too...one might just mistake them to be a devil.Both receive a special power ;leouch gets the geass-the power of the king while light gets the death note-the power to kill anyone by writing their name in the death note.Both the mc wish for a better world ..where all can live a happy life tho their main ideology is nobel but the path they choose to achieve it is beyond cruel.Being smart ,intelligent , cunning they exploit their special power to the fullest to achieve their goal.....""End justifies the means"" true to these words they are ready to deceive , manipulate and even kill people without any hesitation ...going as far as to even kill their own relatives when they proved to be a threat to them.The battle of minds, the madness of the mc., epic quotes and battle etc. make these two anime the best.The plot and twist and the mc are amazing and hence re watching them is totally worth it.You will in love(with the anime) from the very first episode.Hope you like it :)(my first recommendation...on my favorite animes) read more 
The series have a very similar premise. The protagonists are both given a supernatural power that they use to try and change the world. If you enjoy watching anime that keep you at the edge of your seat you'll probably like both the shows. 
The main characters both fight for justice in cruel and harmful ways.  
I don't need to tell it but both the series have an MC with a god like power with which they try to create a new world where they could live and main characters end up to be antiheroes 
The series are both about 1 person that gets a power to do good things, but some people think it isn't good what they're doing, some people do think it's good whether you decide if it isn't or is is up to you. (In death note, the killing of criminals, and in Code Geass, he wants that the 11's to be called Japanese again) They have both a friend, who's on the 'battlefield' an enemy. 
They are both very psychological, the main characters are always outsmarting the rest. More action and a better storyline in Code Geass while Death Note is more of a detective and mystery anime in my opinion. 
They both feel pretty similar.Both great gateaway animes.Both masterpieces. 
Both anime explore the premise of having psychological battles, whereas Death Note is quite mild when it comes to action, Code Geass excels by having thrilling war battles as well as psychological ones. 
Death Note and Code Geass share many similarities. I feel Geass is a bit like Death Note's teenage brother - less dramatic mind-games and more epic action with mechs, gunfights, airship battles and boobs. It still maintains the mind-games theme with our anti-hero Lelouch being similar to Light Yagami in many ways, but if Death Note was intriguing but just a bit too slow for you - Code Geass is a great shout 
The main characters of both series, Lelouch and Light, are very similar. Both are prodigies who intend to change the world for the better using their special powers.  
This is a rather well known recommendation: a two anime rivalry known through the entire anime community. Both Code Geass and Death Note have similar characters; primarily Light Yagami and Lamperouge Lelouch, two evil geniuses striving to achieve their ""justice."" Both shows cover rather complex plans made by their protagonists, meaning the plot sometimes gets really complex. That said, it has multiple other similarities, but I mustn't spoil the fun. 
Ever wonder what it would be like to have the power of a God? The ability to kill any person instantaneously or how about have people follow any command you give? These anime don't ask what it is to be a hero, they ask if you would become a villain in order to save your world. These series are for anyone who wants to watch a game of chess take place on a global scale. These anime are two of my top favorites of all time (I don't have that many, promise). If you're looking for an Epic series then watch it because you'll ask yourself the question, how far would I be willing to go?  read more 
Both anime have awesome main characters that are to smart for their own good. Both anime will have you heavily involved in the story and characters until the end (not so much with death note since the second season isn't anywhere near as good as the first). The mind games characters play against each other in these are amazing and very entertaining to watch. Death is a great anime to help feel the void from Code Geass. 
This should come as no surprise but seriously if you have watched and enjoyed one of these two series and haven't watched the other I strong suggest you do so. Both series share a similar narrative with one guy gaining a supernatural ability that he uses in an attempt to change the world! While they are not of equal quality when it comes to the story and overall cast, if you liked either Light or L in Death Note, you'll probably love Lelouch vi Britannia!  
If you liked Code Geass then you'll definitively like death note since both anime have a very good story development and both focus a lot in the psychological of the character. 
the same main character who tries to change the world where he lives 
Both main characters have a justice sense of thinking, and want to help the world, even if the world disapproves. Both have amazing characters and enjoyable moments. 
Another monstrously successful series about a gifted youth who uses his power to change the world. Less political intrigue and a lot less high school shenanigans result in a tighter narrative. 
I think both animes contains a lot of mind games, cool and genius main characters.Also with their powers, main characters can manipulate others in different ways. 
Main champions wants to be a god of the world. This animes logic is comming to intelligence war. 
The two are very similar, but for spoiler reasons I'll be pretty vague! When you actually watch you'll notice many similarities and if you liked one you'll probably like the other! Similarities:-Main characters are shown as natural, kind of narcissistic, geniuses-MCs use the supernatural to gain power *CG: Geass (Basically mind control) *DN: The Death Note (Basically the power to kill anyone, within certain criteria)-MCs are given their supernatural abilities by a supernatural being-MCs have limits to their power, i.e. how they can use it/who they can use it on-MCs are not the only ones who have had access to this power-MCs are basically up against the world with at least one person they use as a 'tool' to gain their desire-MCs use their power to cause some change to the world-MCs involve their immediate family in their affairs and their actions directly affect their family (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧ read more 
Mastermind head character.Plan from beginning trying to prevent trouble still have effective action. 
If you liked death note, then Code Geass is basically something similar to death note. I personally like Code Geass more. Despite the art not being really good, the story is one of the best out there! Both the stories have a Main Character that can be viewed as a good guy or a bad guy and both the stories have a second main character which can be viewed as the opponent of the main character. Both L in death note and Lelouch in Code Geass have a high level of intelligence and they are both very smart. The story might be boring to some of you out there, but trust me it gets way better! I'd rate this Anime 8.5-9 out of 10! read more 
The plots are very similar yet very different but both are about mind games and planing ahead. 
Code Geass is literally Death note with mechs. Main hero plans how to beat his opponents, then uses his power to do so. Lot of figuring stuff out, twist and turns in both of these. And both have main characters that you love and hate at the same time. 
The story for both of these shows involve incredibly smart protagonists that are high school students who have the desire to change the world around them to their liking. Both protagonists also obtain something that gives the character a chance/push to make progress on their goals. The main characters also have similar thinking/a view of justice that isn't seen by everyone who watches as morally right, which is why they can be viewed as anti-heroes. They use whatever is necessary to achieve or get one step closer to their goal regardless of whether the step they took to get there is viewed as cruel or inhuman. If you liked one of these shows then you will definitely like the other. read more 
If you like a smart character, and mystery or puzzle or detective or some kind like that, you need to watch one of this, death note is about a person using a book to kill bad people to make a world a better place and codegeass is about robot fighting but got a smart main character that want a peace and both of the main character got a smart brain 
Similarities between "" Code Geass "" and "" Death Note ""> Having a similar character to change the world, namely, Yagami Light and Lamperouge Lelouch> Both want to change and control the world> Genius, smart strategizing> Both had another name / pseudonym ( KIRA - ZERO )> Both dapet help from ( being ) another. ( Shinigami & C.C )> Both have supernatural things that help them ( Death note & Geass )> Both think they are correct> Both have people who have sacrificed on behalf of their> Both can manipulate people ( Death note & Geass ) 
- Both focus on super-intelligent and strategic protagonists who, when they gain a power and are able to apply their sense of justice, advance their goals, assume an identity both idolized and feared by people, but still hide their true identity.- Light is more psycho, using either one to fulfill his goals, Lelouch, several times, loses control and coming out of your goal, but he blames himself, he repents and moves on. 
Both have amazing protagonists, great plot and are solid choices for a change of pace from shounen or if you're tired of lackluster protagonists. They're worth the hype and high ratings. I checked them out after hearing people call Code Geass & Death Note top tier series and afterwards I feel it is justified. It is best to not say more as it's very important to avoid spoilers with both series. Thankfully they do get straight to the point so best thing is to try at least several episodes, you'll probably end up completing it before you know it. 
Pretty obvious comparison, but I make the recommendation anyway. Both anime are driven by anti-heroes who seek to impose their own brand of justice through supernatural means. Both play out like an intricate chess game between the vigilante and the established order. 
If you like all the clever and mystery-solving situations, this is for you. The main characters are also really similar.They both:Have special powersWant to control the world or something similarThey got their power from something or someone else 
Both heavily involve tactics and many draw similarities between the protagonists. I've often found that if people like one of these, they'll like the other. I myself love both of them. 
It has similar tones to it as Death Note. But is different to make it likable as its own. I personally don't like mechs but even then this anime impressed me. 
I would say that they are quite a few similarities between code geass and death note, some being that they both focus on the story of two young teenagers who have acquired a supernatural power that they use in order to change the world to fit their own ideals. Both protagonists feel as though the world is rotten and that the innocent suffer whilst those who commit bad things live without being punished. So after seeing the atrocities of the world both characters choose to use their powers in order to right the wrongs of the world, however this results in the deaths of innocents and the loss of humanity in both characters. However the difference between Light (main character of death note) and Lelouch (main character of code geass) is that Lelouch still manages to retain some of his humanity all due to the love and affection he has for his younger sister. However Light completely abandons his emotions and humanity in order to achieve his goal.Code geass does however have a lot of plot holes and rather than showing us Lelouch's brilliance it tell us whereas death note gives us a clear insight to Light's intelligence by giving the viewer a detailed look at how Light's mind works and how he manages to manipulate people with his plans.However Code geass had one of the greatest endings of all time, not only did it wrap up the story line perfectly it was also very satisfying since it cleared up a lot of things and gave the audience what they wanted. Death note also has a brilliant ending which was somewhat predictable due to the inevitability of it.Overall both shows are amazing and fairly similar but they both have their own unique plot line which makes them interesting and captivating to watch. I personally would say that code geass is an anime which shares a lot of the same aspects as death note which makes them similar but keep in mind they aren't the exact same, each have things that differentiate with one another which I think makes them even better. read more 
Two intelligent shows that will intrigue you a lot, because of their well done construction on the development of the story (for the most part) and mainly their main characters that share many similarities, both being revolutionary geniuses that change a whole society, with rivals who try everything to stop them. 
Another protagonist that wants to change the world, a similiar series that takes it to the next level. 
Both Animes:-Have A Genuis Main Character-Haves the Main Character obtain a supernatural ability-Have a Main Character that tries to change the world by killing 
Both principal characters are barely genius and they both are looking for a perfect world which they 're gonna create 
most obvious recommendation ever, a incredibly smart guy receives some kind of convenient power and decides to use it for his own good while trying to help other humans in the process, all around mindgames, mysteries and psychological warfare, only difference is that code geass actually has war due to mecha while death note sticks to the psychological ground, also the relation between suzaku/lelouch instantly reminds of L/Light 
Both feature somewhat mind-game-ish battles in which one person tries to outsmart somebody else, and have some mild twists that you might enjoy. Additionally, the main characters have to lead a sort of double life and must hide their actions from authorities. 
The main characters suffer from a god complex 
Ideas of justice and vigilante justice; morally intriguing; will question basic premises of right vs wrong 
Death Note isn't exactly similar to Code Geass but they both have main characters who are practically the same person. Lelouch from Code Geass and Light Yagami from Death Note are absolutely amazing characters. They are both geniuses, they possess some type of absolute power, and they are also undeniably very likable characters. 
There are many things that are similar with the series, such as:1. The main characters. Light and Lelouch are both geniuses. Lelouch is manipulative, and is willing to do evil to achieve his goals, similar to Light who was willing to kill criminals to make his ideal world. They are both powerful anti-hero characters.2. Code Geass has battles between geniuses like Light and L, such as Schneizel vs. Lelouch.3. The mc's both have unique powers that they use with the intention to achieve their ideal worlds. Light uses his death note to kill people he deems dangerous or bad for the world, while Lelouch uses his power of geass to control people and bend them to his will to forward his goals.4. There are moral inconsistencies between the main characters Suzaku and Lelouch, similar to how Light and L opposed each other's ideals. read more 
One of the most engaging aspects of these two show's storytelling is through the perspective of their main characters who are both non-stop thinkers, always trying to plan ahead, be meticulous and account for as  much that can be predicted as possible. If you enjoyed one, you very well might enjoy the other. Moreover, if what you liked is the main character's intelligence, you will find it in the other work too as both feature battles of wit rather than brawn. 
The atmosphere of both of them is similar,while Lelouch takes on the world on his own,so does Light againt best of  the police in the world.the mc in both is pretty op too. 
Similarities:1- Amazing MCs2- MCs with a personal goal to obtain 3- Extremely Intelligent MCs4- MCs encounter a supernatural creature which grants them power on conditions5- Thriller Mystery Dark Gore Psychology Killings6- MCs kills many people who oppose them or are evil7- MCs try to change the world in their own way 8- MCs strategically fights against an organization9- Similar setting and atmosphere10 - Amazing OST  
both main protagonists have grey morals and will do anything to rule their respective society.both protagonists hold a special power.both protagonists have stunning intuition and wit.both are seen spiraling into chaos 
Both feature pseudo-autistic geniuses.Both are great gateway anime.Both have complex plots but aren't that deep or intellectual overall.Both are fast and thrilling.  
Both animes, have as a theme a protagonist who does everything to achieve his goal, however different from Death Note, the protagonist of Code Geass, does not lose himself and also does not do it for himself. He commits all acts, for the sake of his little sister, Nunnally, who is in wheelchairs, due to the attack that her mother suffered. Lelouch asks for explanations for the king, but the king denies the help, after the discussion, he expels him from Brittania and the title of prince and is still sold, indignant he swears revenge on Britannia and create the world of peace that his sister so wants . read more 
These are definitely good successor's of each other. They both have really cool supernatural powers in them. In addition, the main characters are in a moral gray. They are both very good, so if you like one, you'll probably like the other. 
Psychological and the main character is a genius having to face off against other genius' in mental battles in order to get his end goal; the world and all whom inhabit it to be at peace under his rule... Sound familiar? 
Very psychological anime like death note the main characters are also alike in that they wish to change to change the world. 
Both have the main character try to outsmart their opponents by using their wit. Also, they're both about taking over the world I guess. 
This show gives off the same vibe watching Lelouch overcome obstacles as in Death Note with Light. 
Psychological, similar protagonists 
You have stumbled upon the UNO Reverse card of anime. Watch as these conniving villain protagonists, tilt their noses upward, eat chips, and wear supervillain masks to scoff at their opposition. These shows take two very different approaches in two very different worlds, but the fact that they follow a protagonist who takes on the role of a villain makes them the star of the show.Death Note, in spite of the supernatural power of the Journal of Doom, takes a more realistic approach being grounded in the real world. Taking on the role of the vigilante removing the scum of the earth made detectives take notice.So, much of his struggles involve him outsmarting these detectives in brilliant schemes to eliminate his threats. He finds himself squaring off against a brilliant detective and thus the struggle between these two makes them the stars of the show, bringing all sorts of mind games and logical manipulation into play.Code Geass is placed in a corrupt imperial world where Brittan has conquered all. Now Japan makes it's futile struggle to combat the Britannia Empire. In the middle of this struggle, a discontent imperial prince finds himself thrown into this struggle as he finds the green haired asylum chick who gives him the power to change this corrupt empire. So now, Japan has a brilliant villain of Britannia to support them, winning impossible battles with superb strategic prowess. The hopeless rebellion that Britain scoffed at soon becomes a world-wide threat under the mask of the Black Prince.Both shows draws you in with the power of the main characters' intelligence, working your brain as you try to keep up with how they solve the challenges that oppose them. read more 
Both has a GENIUS character in them. 
The mani character is anti-hero Both have genius main character who want to change the world with unique power they got. 
Both series are excellent on how they put some psychologic themes into the series and keep you on the edge of your seat at all times. 
Death Note in mechas... I'm not even joking...Two incredibly smart 16yo MCs who gain godly powers from a supernatural friend and vow to use them to change the world for the better, regardless of the means. 
Both are basically the same:-A superhuman dude fighting another superhuman dude.The main difference Code geass includes final fantasy style scifi-setting,where as,Death note is more of a reality drama that exagerrates everything(in a good way) 
The MC is a strategist and tactical. The MC is evil in the opinion of justice. Awesome rivalry between two people who has different definition of justice. 
Death Note focuses on a male prodigy as well, who can violently cross the line between life and death with a power that he receives out of the blue in the first episode. Both characters have guides who explain the limits of their abilities, while being creepy in differing manners. The plots are set up elaborately, and while there is a much smaller amount of action in Death Note, the way it lays out the master plan and how the protagonist (anti-hero-agonist?) faces his threats just makes this the perfect show to watch if you've just freshly finished the Code Geass series.  
Both animes have incredible scripts;The protagonists of both works are extremely intelligent and strategists;Both animes have very good productions;Anyway, both are spectacular works! 
Scratches a similar itch, involving a super-powered psychopath attempting to change the world through nefarious means, down to the same thrilling mind-games and identity concealment struggles. 
Everyone seems to make this comparison because of the extremely overpowered abilities of Light Yagami of Death Note and Lelouch Lamperouge of Code Geass. Both protagonists are genius characters in their own right, and have a strong manipulative personality that, along with their acquired uses of a Death Note and a Geass, respectively, allows them to ultimately fight towards their own idea of a ""better world."" 
Code Geass and Deathnote are similar in the following aspects :-Main characterBoth Lelouch and Light turns out to be Anti — Hero which means that they started their journey for a good cause but ended as a villian.Both Lelouch and Light are genius in their own ways .Both of them visioned for a new world .Both Light and Lelouch had Misa and C.C respectively on their side who will safegaurd both of them no matter what.-Side charactersWhile their is kiyomi takada in Deathnote their is Euphemia who were fooled by main character fake emotion , used by the main character and died.Both have some kind of witch / devil who gave people powers without any reason . Codes in Code Geass and Shinigamis in Deathnote.- PowersBoth anime had a super power while in code Geass their was the power of Geass while Deathnote had a powerful book which can be used for killing people .-GenreBoth are Thirller , Military , Drama . read more 
Story is somewhat similar in its scope and the protagonist share many characterstic traits, first and foremost their ""unbreakable"" ""morals"" and intelligence. 
Main characters are really smart and they have a common goal to eradicate all evil from their respective worlds with the use of similar devices.  
-Both have a intelligent and strategist main character-Both MC think what they are doing is correct-Apparently they are doing it the wrong way-There is a character that would put the MC in trouble.-Lots of strategies that makes your brain hurt 
If you are a fan of death note .You must watch Code Geass orbif you are a fan of code geass.you must watch death note because both shows some similair thing such as:both main characters acts as villians to to apply the justice In addition both of them have a supernatural power(light has the death note and leloch has the power of geass).both shows features by planning and intelligence with a strong plot 
Both main characters go against the world and try to become the ruler of said world. Both are also very similar personality wise, and have an upper hand with a unique power, though one is more respectable than the other. These are ingenious classics of the medium and if you enjoyed one, you're likely to enjoy the other. 
Both Lelouch and Light have similar character in terms of the way they think and all. 
Both anime's have a genius ""Anti-Hero"" MC  
Two extremely genius protagonists who use what they receive to dominate their world. 
These shows are literally the exact same and they both came out at similar times:- main character is extremely smart and is bored at school- he finds or receives a power that allows them to make plans to change the world- they make an alter ego and gather a following- the character that gives the main character the power stays with them and makes comments on their actions- the authorities send someone to find out the identity of the main characters- both shows become bad in the second halfboth of these shows are really interesting and intense but they do unfortunately drop in quality towards the end (for Code Geass in season 2), They are still worth watching though. read more 
Both Lelouch and Light turns out to be anti-hero which means that they started their journey for a good cause but ended as a villain. Both anime had a super power while in code Geass their was the power of Geass while Death note had a powerful book which can be used for killing people. Both are Thriller, Military, Drama.  
Both anime contains intense battle of wits that will shape the world to come, creating moral questions of what is good and bad or what is right and wrong. Both anime will challenge your viewpoints on how to battle issues relating to society and the definition of freedom and what price one has to pay in order to obtain it. 
It's been said before but Light and Lelouch(the protagonist of Code Geass) are functionally the same character, and the two shows have a fairly similar premise. The primary difference is that Lelouch has aspirations for his newfound power at a grander scale than Light does, and that Lelouch's world view, morality and actions are challenged by his experiences throughout the story in a more meaningful way with significant consequences at different stages.  
main character has a similar complex of trying to change the world 
If you want to see animes that have MC who plans to rule the world or may have God complex. 
Just like Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch Similar Recommendations, the main character of death note got a power and started use it to get rid of the evil of the world. 
The main characters gain the means to change to world, though it will take some sacrifices and morally questionable choices to do it. They are cold and intelligent, always planning some type of strategy and thinking a few steps ahead. 
I believe these to be two great shows. Both main characters strive to become above humanity to ""save it"". Both characters have the mind set that the ends justify the means which creates an amazing character personality that you can't help but admire and love. Plus Code Geass has a banger of an opening just like Death Note which for me is a pretty big deciding factor. 
Lelouch and Light are in a similar situation where they have to play a villainous/anti-hero role using a supernatural power. Both need to conceal their identity. Both are great tacticians. 
Light and Lelouch are rather similar main characters. Although particularly clever, they're both ordinary students in appearance. However, they have secretly inherited an extraordinary power that they will use along with impressive cunning to shape the world as they wish and make their own sense of justice prevail while trying to conceal their identity. 
- Smart protoganist with tons of interesting ideas and strategies- Both have a unique supernatural power- Interesting goals and journey 
“This world is rotten, and those who are making it rot deserve to die. Someone has to do it, so why not me?” - Light Yagami. One day protagonist Light Yagami finds himself in the possession of the 'Death Note' and with it decides to purge the world of evil ans rebuild it with himself as it's unquestionable leader and god of this new world.""You can't change the world without getting your hands dirty” - Lelouch Lamperouge. One day protagonist Lelouch vi Britania finds himself caught in possession of the 'Power of Kings' and with it he takes on the name of 'Zero' and decides to conquer the world and rebuild it.The similarity between the two can be hard to distinguish at first sight but what about their endgame? What about their motivations? Well as for that Light's endgame benefits himself in the longrun while Lelouch's is set to benefit a special someone. But is either of them right? Or are they both simply out for blood. These cold and calculating individuals can clearly relate to eachother in some aspects. Odds are someone who thought one was interesting are gonna think the same of the other. read more

MC who has the ability and does things behind the scenes, without the public knowing who he is 
I found Code Geass later down the line but I have to say the ideas of having power and psychology are found in here as well as Death Note. Also you could say its high IQ anime where its almost watching a board game. Basically a lot of strategy and thinking is done in the anime. Also the themes of justice and such are present here as well. Also lets be honest Code Geass is an amazing anime and one of my favorite...  
Much like Death Note, we are shown the inner workings of a mad man set on changing the world. We get to follow the man behind the mask as he marches into war with strategic methods. 
Both the shows depict main characters with unruly ambitions and their reckless pursuit after them. Both shows delve into the themes of death in contrasting ways making them enjoyable.  
Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch and Death Note are both amazing, if you haven't watch them oh boy your missing out.Death Note is similar to Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch because its about a intellectual getting a supernatural ability (or notebook) and using that to do what they think is right for the world. in both shows the mc's both have to hide there special ability (or notebook) from people they are close to. One of the big differences though, is Death Note doesnt have huge mechs killing people. 
These are mid to late 2000s animes that involve highly intelligent main characters that receive a special ability/item whether it be a notebook or a physical power. They also play kind games in both animes so that they can get closer to their goal of changing the world. 
Both protagonists are powerful enough to kill anyone with few requirements (Light needing the name, while Lelouch needs to see the face in person eye-to-eye). They are also psychological anime, and despite how intelligent the main characters are, they screw up.  
Death Note and Code Geass are essentially soulmates. Both have the same introductions, of which, an intelligent high school student finds a supernatural element, which allows them to enforce their ideals upon the world. Accompanied by their supernatural partners, both anime gives intense mind games between the MC and the world around them. However, with Code Geass, there is more focus on a range of even such as mecha fights, mild romance, and friendships. 
Both mc's are smart and had good intentions, to begin with, but are later corrupted by the power that was bestowed upon them. 
Imagine Death Note, but with Mechs. Yessir! 
Both the main protagonists and antagonists have a battle between different senses of justice. The main character of both series use intricate strategies to protect their own secrets while maintaining the facade of being a normal student. 
Both the MCs are super intelligent and try to bring justice to the world and Code Geass is one of my personal favorites do I think everyone will like it. 
The mc's have attained grand power and both are somewhat anti-herosThe mc's have a different view of justice than the public.The mc's arent afraid to kill most people.Both mc's are incredibly smart. 
Anti-heros doing something for the what they believe is greater good. 
This anime I definitely would recommend especially if you just started to watch anime. This anime is a classic and is original. The story is easy to understand and is easy to get into. I personally really liked Death Note because of the main characters (Light and L). They are both very different from each other but they are very enjoyable to watch. I honestly think anyone can enjoy watching this anime.  
Smart protagonist?Check.Fighting against the world all by your lonesome? CheckSpectacular manipulations? CheckBetrayals? Check.Extremely strategic psychological battles? Chevk 
They are very similar because both have a mysterious power of which only the protagonist knows the existence. In addition, both present a super intelligent protagonist. 
Great characters with well-developed and complex reasoning, rise to the omnipotence of the protagonist 
Two big brained protagonists trying to achieve their goals using the power given to them by a god-like figure. Both are great psychological thrillers. 
Both the Protagonist are intelligent and strategist.  
If you like code Geass you will surely like death note. Both story revolves around mind games of protagonist. But the stories and concepts are completely different. 
Well,for me these two animes are very common and for other people too. They both feature two main characters that are both really smart and intelligent and another thing is that in both animes the main characters want to conquer the world or change the world. If you watch Code Geass but want a bit more dark in my opinion you should watch this.P.S.both of these animes are from the same type of genre witch is is psychology so if you like that stuff AND code geass then give this anime a try. 
Must-watch cinematic genius. 
You will like it cause their are also mind games :) 
We see both protagonist on their journey with individual supernatural abilities, which give them the opportunity to shape the world how they desire. 
both light and lelouch seek their 'ideal' world with their power.both protagonist have a sense of justice that they want to accomplish. and they're both really smart! 
The protagonists have very similar viewpoints and personalities, and it's entertaining to watch as their well thought out strategies play out. Both also move into darker themes as the protagonist becomes more desperate later on. Also L and Light have a similar rivalry to Lelouch and Suzaku. 
Code Geass and Death Note are really similar as opposed to how the story goes. Both of the main characters get powers in order to complete/fulfill a goal in mind. Both animes has people thinking the mcs are deemed as evil. They both fight an opposing side which don't believe in their ways of achieving something. I would recommend this to anyone who likes any of these animes. 
It has similar strategy elements and also very good characters, although there is fighting in code geass, which is completely different to death note. 
amazing mc, mind games and cat mouse battles, and the main protagonist gets a power which makes him want to challenge the system. pretty similar. 
I like this anime more than i expected! The protagonist is incredible character, the topic they discuss in this show is very interesting, the mind games and the twists and turns are very good, it because of that i compare it to death note! The production is above of the others.If you wanna see a anime better planned but well centered this show is a good option!!! 
Because both main caracters are genious  
It's not similar in the world setting but on the psychological and philosophical basis.L and light, Suzaku and lelouchthey are the protagonist of respective series and have similar ideology 
Both these anime are written incredibly intelligently. While one is a crime type anime and the other is almost a sci-fi, war/strategy anime, both will keep you completely guessing at what will come next and you'll never be able to figure it out. The twist and turns both these anime take are leagues above other anime and due to this fact you'll be left satisfied and engaged the whole way through.Code Geass is a great show to get into, it isn't long in length and wastes no time getting to the point and pushing the plot forward. The art style may take a few episodes for some viewers to get used to but it's worth it if you find it an issue. The best part about these 2 anime is for the most part, the main characters are seemingly morally ambiguous and so you can sympathise with them for your own reasons but also form your own opinion on the mistakes they make, making them, in my opinion, very in depth characters.Watch Code Geass, just look at the rating of it, its no lie. read more 
Similarities:- Psychological plot- Annoyingly smart MC- The MC gets a Godlike super power- Questionable intentions- but kinda makes sense- Hard to follow plot- Both get really annoying near the end but both are worth it 
Should I really tell you why you should watch both series? The stories are similar: two guys getting a power and using it for the great of good. The characters are extremely intelligent and pay attention to whatever acts they perform. There are also supernatural characters who often accompany the protagonist. While Code Geass is more humorous than Death Note, they share many moments of tension in which many characters die. 
- Both have a very hot MC- Rivalry between opposite sides in secret of each other- Some of the greatest comedy relief- Interesting and cool powers for the MC to drive the story- Beautiful endings 
These are not my own words, but Code Geass is 'basically Death Note but with mechas and a lot more action"". If you like Light, or at least his cleverness/brains, you'll also like the main character of Code Geass. The plot for both shows are similar as well. 
The strategies used are mind-blowing, along with great plot twists and other elements of entertainment. Both shows are really great to watch. 
 Both protagonists named Lelouch Lamperouge and Light Yagami are given a power so that they can make a change in the everyday world. Both are joined by a mysterious person who seems to be from another world. Both of the protagonists also hide their identity but make their alias public (Zero and Kira). They both are extremely strategic and smart on how they choose to fight the world. Both of them have a drive to make a change and will stop at nothing to achieve their goal. Both of them also act like normal people in public because their identity is not known. If you liked Deathnote you would definitely like Code Geass and a good reason is because like Deathnote the main character faces a lot of psychological problems because of what they face.  read more 
Instead o the protagonist being an extremely over powered like; dragon ball, one piece, or Naruto. light and Lelouch rely on their brain to excel in what they are doing. Both characters are extremely likable and instead of them being good guys, these two are more like villains, but you still want to cheer them on. 
Both Lelouch and Light think ahead and use mind games 
Both have protagonists that think and act in a similar way and are hoping to achieve a goal, to make the world a better place. They are pretty much the same character in all aspects. Both shows also aired the same year. 
Yes both anime requires wide variety of knowledge and both anime are pretty similar despite being differencein genre 
the protagonist is also a very smart person with the same sense of justice as light, but he have the power to force anyone to do anything he asks for once per person. 
Both are psychological thrillers and Both protaginists are genius 
You get a Powerful and Smart and Badass MC in both the series. Both Anime have a pretty good exciting plot. In Death Note there is Kira and in Code Geass there is Zero who use their mind just like a God for defeating whoever comes in their way. 
Both Death Note and Code geass are about a genius high school student making complicated plans to change society. They both use the mask of a fake name and violence that gains them enemies and followers. They both also have a duo protagonist who is working against the first protagonist, but you root for both of them. In my opinion Death Note loses momentum part way through the series, but Code Geass has a clear direction throughout both seasons which leads up the one of the greatest anime endings. There is amazing character development that gets you excited about side plots, mech action that doesn't take up too much of the screen time, and ""super powers"" that are complex and unpredictable. read more 
Main characters are smart and “evil”. Both have a secret identity. Both have a younger sister (lol). 
Can anyone name a better comparison? Both of them are the icon of shounen anime back in 2006 and has set a high standard for any new gen anime. Light Yagami and Lelouch Lamperouge are both best anti-hero anime ever see with the same intention: to change the world into a better place, although it takes everything to achieve that goals. Both of them gained superpower to reach their goals: a death note that can kills everyone and Geass that can make everyone obey the owner of itBoth of the anime has amazing soundtrack and scoring music and filled with psychological battle, thrilling sequence, and a battle of evil and effort to reach each of their ideas of Justice. A must must watch if you just got into anime but if you're an old anime lovers like me, this certainly will be on your list. Both of them are 10/10 in my personal perspective read more 
You like thinking?Do you like to plays a math and feeling smart than any classmate?Take code geassDo you like 1v1 thinking with ur friends?Take death note 
Light tries to rid the world of criminals using the Death note. On the other hand, Lelouch of Code Geass tries to bring justice to the World with the power of the Geass. He can give an order to anyone using his Geass just by looking at his victim's eyes.  
Similar psychologically, MCs are very frequently compared in terms of intelligence, same evil vibes as well 
Both anime consists of a main character who unexpectedly receives a super power out of the blue. They use their power to bring 'justice' to their distorted society. If you liked one, you will definitely enjoy the other as they are very similar.  
The main characters are similarThe storyline is better compared to death noteThe ending is a masterpiece 
The main character gives the same vibes and sometimes even better as there there are a lot of antagonists. The plot is also great and the anime has something for everyone 
Both shows have intelligent protagonists that are doing what they think is best for the world and and act like anti-heros. They both lack moralities and ethic to be considered a “hero”. They both also gain a sort of supernatural power (for Light the death note and for Lelouch the Geass). There’s also lots of thinking and strategic moves involved in both animes. 
This is  my first recommendation so sorry if I misspell something.-Both characters are seeking to make world a better place for people.-Both of them are getting some unnatural superpower from unknown source.-Both of the MC are antagonists of the story.I really enjoy watching both series mainly because of complex story with plot twists and because of MC's which are also antagonist of the series.   Sorry for real short recommendation, it was my first one.     
They both have a genius main-character, who acquires a supernatural advantage, and tries to change the world with it. However these main-characters soon turn into cold-hearted conquerors, who are even capable of sacrificing their allies to reach their goal.  Both animes contain battles of wits. The main-character of Death Note has an equally genius opponent, while the main-character of Code Geass has many opponents. 
its basically an anime super similar to death note with more action packed storyline and like death note also answers some of the philosophical viewpoints of life and explores human nature. 
this is quite popular but if you didnt know both mcs have similar intentions both then recieve powers that help them achieve their goaldeath note is better overall but code geass has a better ending and it has the best ending in any anime i have seen 
The protagonists, Light Yagami and Lelouch of the Rebellion, are quite similar in many ways. Both plotlines include betrayal and tension between ""frenemies"" (if you can call them that) as one of the main themes. Both plotlines are also based on a teen who suddenly has a supernatural power and a new supernatural companion in the middle of a normal world.Code Geass has a lot of action almost every chapter, death note however is more 'relaxed'. In Death Note, the world was our everyday world until Light decided he had to fix it, but in Code Geass Japan is in the middle of a war, so the setting is more... disastrous than an apartment. As CG is a much newer series, the animation is a hundred times better. read more 
both have similiar mc and they have op power to achive thier goal similar dark tone and themespoiler : -bouth a sad ending 
Both main characters are super smart, have special divine power that the enemies don't know of, have an immortal partner, and have a plan to create a new world by using their special divine power that has been gifted from their immortal partner. Both main characters also faced the same action during the final stage of the show. Also, both shows are very thrilling and legendary. BTW, both main characters are also high school students. 
Just go watch Code Geass, is the same with death note but with mechs. 
They both have more psychological side of battle and both are quite dark. 
Are you one the people who just started watching anime and are baffled by 'L' and Light Yagami's strategies and tactics?Can't imagine a better anime of the same genre but are desperate to see one?I have got the perfect fit for you.Watch Code Geass. It has the most beautiful ending ever that Death note animators fully compromised and rushed into. 
similar feeling trough  the fact that both maincharacters try to save the world on a dark path. Both are psychological and I feel the anime are just very intressting. I think if you like one of them you gonna like the other one too. 
These shows are very similar as they have a similar style with plot twisting and a great ending. These are only different because Code Geass is a futuristic version of Death Note 
They both are masterpieces of anime with code geass having the best ending. "
1575,820,21,"Imagine Code Geass without ""magical eyes"", mechs, ideas like ""the one who yells louder wins"", immortal women and stupid idealism (hi Suzaku). You with me so far? Now, imagine Code Geass where there are dozens of great commanders like Lelouch on both sides, where political intrigues, plots and schemes are far from uncommon. Imagine battles of epic proportions and war on the galactic scale, where winning side is decided only by commanders intelligence, number of troops, their morale and available resources, not superunits like Lancelot. Do this and you've invented LoGH. 
In Both the hero is nobility. Lelouch was a discarded prince while Reinhard was a poor noble. But both want to remove the nobility from power. Both have grand plans to unify the world for the sake of their sisters. Both are charismatic and have strong allies and enemies. Both are Genius military guys and will make sacrifices for the grand dream. 
Aristocratic governments, political machinations, Xanatos' gambits, the whole shebang. 
Hubris. Revenge. Noblesse Oblige. Revolution. Heroics. Anti-Heroics. Tragedy. Power grabs. Machiavellian schemes. Funny European names. If you like those, then you'll like both shows.In addition, both stories follow a young man who wants revenge by increasing his power until he can succeed in overthrowing the monarchy because of the Emperor being a jackass who ruined the life of the protagonist's sister. 
Code Geass is essentially a ""down to earth"" (literally) version of Legend of the Galactic Heroes, and I don't mean that in a condescending way.Since the basic plot and characters are similar, I thought I'd outline some of the main differences between the two shows. Oh, and I'm also writing this under the assumption that people like these shows primarily because of the strategy behind the battles. Some minor spoilers may be included. You have been warned.Legend of Galactic Heroes1. There are Lelouches on both sides (i.e. people other than Lelouch are not portrayed as whimpering idiots).2. There is none of that ""I have the Nightmare with more guns than you so I win"" crap. Actual strategy and tactics are demonstrated throughout the whole show - formation, movement, timing, geography etc.3. Suzaku, the ridiculous idealist who must say and do what he thinks is right, doesn't exist (replaced by a slightly less vocal Kircheis).4. At one point, LoGH becomes difficult to follow which its detailed storyline, huge cast of characters and the lengthy timeline over which the show spans.5. There are no supernatural powers that allow you to control people. Both commanders don't start from zero in the first place, so they have no need for Geass. Lelouch didn't need Geass as much once he established himself either.Code Geass1. Lelouch actually loses...many times. Maybe it's just me, but I swear the main commanders in LoGH don't ever ""lose""; Reinhard wins by decimating the Alliance's forces, but Yang also wins because he pulled off a miraculous retreat - everybody wins! Yeah...no.2. CG definitely has better graphics. Something from 1988 just can't compare...3. Reinhard, the super-genius robot, doesn't exist (replaced by a slightly more human Lelouch).4. I feel CG, even without Geass, is less realistic in general; by less realistic, I mean there are ""unbelievable coincidences"" happening all over the place.5. There are more obvious plot holes. For example, the fact that Lelouch never commands anyone to obey all his commands (until the end of R2)...is a major one.Watch whichever. Hell, watch both. Even if I don't sound very supportive, I really think they're both amazing. read more 
But focus heavily on tactics and strategy. 
Empire, politics, rebellions, good characters and all that jazz 
what happens when there are bunch of brilliant masterminds like lelouch on both sides vying for world supremacy that is LOGH. Code Geass is pure mecha while LOGH is spacewar. 
Both have battles that don't rely on strength in numbers or the capability of weapons to fight. They rely on strategies and tactics.Lelouch/Zero can compare to Reinhard because they are both tactical geniuses, as is Yang, Wenli from LOGH.Both anime give a clear explanation on how their world is run and the background of it. 
LOGH is the Mature and Sophisticated version of CG. It's the evolution from a kid still Potty Training, to being the Engineer that built the Zero-Gravity Space Toilet. It's the leap from being a Pee Wee League Basketball kid, to being the next Michael Jordan. It's the upgrade from Atari 2600 to the Playstation 4 or Xbox One. It's the difference in illumination between a Candle and the Sun. It's the transition from an Appetizer to the Main Course- and that is the main merit of watching CG, as to prepare you for the Real Deal.When one has seen enough of the ""Staples"" and ""Popular"" Anime, and are looking for the Next Level, they turn to the True Elite Logh. Until that point they can not be considered a True Anime Fan. read more 
Code Geass take heavy inspiration from LOGH, and some may come to say Geass is the ""teenage shounen"" version of LOGH.I prefer LOGH, because it's much more fleshed out compared to Geass. I would recommend LOGH to most people I know, while I would only recommend Geass to someone who can get by it's ""edgy teenage drama"" feel.  
Code Geass, but without the superpowers and a plot that actually makes sense. The shows have a lot of similar character types, however LoGH is much more grounded and build them to a much better degree.The show is heavy on politics and strateg, with schemes on both sides running deep. LoGH also presents many more sides than simply the good kids vs the oppressors. Each plotline raises many moral questions, and it's rare for anyone to ever be strictly in the right or wrong. 
I'll be harsh - Legend of Galactic Heroes is anime for grown ups instead lukewarm and childish thing that is Code Geass. I can not believe that CG is up on the leaderboards with LoGH. If You watched LoGH You will know what I mean. LoGH is all the things that is Code Geass + better politics, believable military strategies and better characterization. Only thing that LoGH lacks and may put you of is animation, its obsolete but You will get used to it and grow to love it by the end of the series :) 
Political plots, desire of power and revenge, clash of 2 ideals, brilliant military commanders, epic battles,  the shape of the 2 animes looks quite similar.The main difference is that Code Geass reaches the peak of ""popcorn"" animes (it is not a reproach) whilst LoGH has way more depth, it is a rewriting of History in the space opera genre. 
Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu is Code Geass father. It creates the genre, it creates the ""choral"" storytelling type in animation (story with lot of balanced characters facing each other, beyond the manichean traditionnal vision) and Lelouch's archetype with Reinhard von Lohengramm. Both animes tell ascent of a charismatic / machiavelic character who is a strategic genius. Both are about politic manipulation, war, peace (this is more developped in LOGH), love, friendship and trahison. But above all, they use same dramatic mecanic and are typically huge greek tragedy with tearing plot-twist which make you hate a  character, prefer another, questionning you about morality ... especially in LOGH you just can't take a side because both groups (Imperials and Rebels) are very well treated. If you watch Code Geass and you enjoy it , please try LOGH because you will not be deceived (don't look at old animation, look at the soul of the piece !), I promise you :) read more 
One can see how Legend of the Galactic Heroes influenced Code Geass. Despite both being set in the future, they both use medieval political systems and decor, the battles in both are very strategic (more so in LotGH) and they both feature an ambitious protagonist whose goals are for the sake of his sister.  
+ Revolve primarily around Political Theories.+ Military/ Sci-Fi orientated.+ Extremely intelligent MC's. 
There is an empire that rules with power, but suppresses human right's of citizens.Both protagonists want to overthrow the ruling empire for different reasons.They have a sister they want to protect and whom they are fighting for at the beginning. They don't want to lose her.They have a close friend who has a similar view of the empire and wants to change it.Both anime use themes of war and politics.The main focus is about the strategic masterminds that the protagonists are and everything counts for on one move. This epic and dangerous adventure is backed up by great pieces of music.Ginga Eiyuu Densets is set in space and tho many also view it as the Star Wars of anime.And it truly is and might also be better, although there are no lightsabers, sorry to disappoint you.BUT, Code Geass has a shit ton of cool Mechas that battle each other on earth. read more 
they seem very much in the military part and with genius protagonists who use great war strategies to defeat their opponents, so are the battles in Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu and Code geass.We can also mention that the two have ideologies on each side that result in a great rivalry, something that also reminds me of the Death Note 
In terms of tactics and conquest themed story lines, as well as a battle of intelligence. 
Both of them contain great Politics and great battle strategies. Both of these series have Ambitious Main Characters who care deeply about their sister. Both Series are great in their own ways. "
1575,2001,16,"These two series both have heavy dosages of mecha, though its mecha done right, when there ARE casualties and sacrifices are made, though Gurren Lagann is less thinking, it still has the right combination of elements to keep you glued to the screen and want more. Think Gurren Lagann as a lighter, less intelligent type, that has a wider scope then Code Geass. 
Though the series main characters are vastly different and Gurren Lagann might be considered a ""lighter"" anime, both of these series engaged me and made me addictively watch as much as 20 eps a day. Additionally, both series fighting is done in mecha and they fight against superpowers with little more than their wills. 
Code Geass and Tegen Toppa Gurren Lagann both involve mecha, and of course, lot's of action. Although the fighting in Code Geass is essentially against one enemy, and in Gurren Lagann, the enemy/opponent varies, it is still clear that there is a protagonist and antagonist in each story. Both take place in the future, as well. In both, the protagonists is a strong character, who has the support of several characters. Both are exciting, and involve a lot of action, as well as some comedy and romance. =)  
Both are mecha animes that envolve around war. Both implement stratigies in their battles however Gurren Lagan is a bit more silly and random. It's like you combined Code Geass with FLCL.  But if you like Code Geass defently try out Gurren Lagann 
They both have have themes of rebellion & oppression. They have very intelligent and talented main cast of characters. They both have amazing art styles with outstanding character design. They are also both Action Mecha anime. The characters are both likeable and relatable. They both have top tier OST's and are both considered classics. 
Similarities : mecha, heroes starts as rebel force fighting against much more powerful opponent, there is one strongly determined leader to whom everybody look up to. Mysterious power working behind scene.Differences: while Gurren Lagann is mainly using comedy to relieve tension after dramatic moments (and there is plenty of those), Code Geass use more serious note in its storytelling. 
Mecha,masterminding about something that very badass,future world and super badass duel scenes among robots are main features that both anime shares. 
Thematically, both series are very similar! Both include large-scale mecha fights, and a plot about overthrowing the government. Gurren Lagann is a great show and well worth a watch. 
Both use a Mecha genre to house underlying intellectual questions and reflections on modern society and the human experience. Both of the anime follow the Hero's Journey very closely (look it up), and follow similar themes of sacrifice, morality and the human condition of betrayal. Both series have amazing character development, although Code Geass starts off a little slow compared to Gurren Lagann in this sense. I'd really recommend persisting past the first 3-4 episodes if you find them a little dry, you won't regret it. 
Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch & Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann are both very renowed and revolutionary series in the Mecha Anime genre. They have a lot of things in common such as the evolution of the main characters, the beautiful designs of the supporting cast and the mechas, the teamwork and interactions with the other characters, the very absorbing plot and the amazing mecha battles in combination with the breathtaking music. In general the entire setting makes it so that by being fascinated by either series it is worth embracing the other as well. 
Both shows are mechas, and ones that non-mecha fans would enjoy. In Code Geass you have a mysterious power as well as interesting tactics, Gurren Laggen has unlikely wins through awesome scenes. Check both out 
If you enjoyed Code Geass then you'll most definitely without fail enjoy this. 
You might think these two are incredibly different style of show, but the concepts and messages are exactly the same. Character motives are similar and the anime's ending are very similar. That and monstrous mecha fights, such great tense action sequences. 
Both stand out mechas from the early 2000's. Dub casts are also very similar. While thematically they are both very different they feel like opposites on the same coin. There are strong conclusions to both franchises and action packed fights loaded with emotional scenes displaying the personalities of the cast. 
Both are amazing mecha anime that cane out around the same time and are highly rated on MAL. Although TTGL is less serious and more comedic than Code Geass. 
1. Mecha2. Nice plot twists3. Action packed4. Similar Episode length "
1575,5114,16,"The main characters both gain powers and sacraficed parts of themselves to gain something. Both have a lot of daddy issues. 
Superpowers, ancient evil conspiracies, awesome fight scenes, and a fast-paced story with tons of jokes thrown in. 
Suspense, great power, great characters, militar strategies and war. Code Geass has less of a plot and undeveloped secondary characters comparing to FMA Brotherhood but its story manages to keep you on your seat nevertheless. 
Code Geass and FMA: Brotherhood both combine great action sequences with superb plotlines that explore subjects such as immortality, government oppression, and genocide. 
Both series are based around a group fighting against an much bigger portion of society. Both involve high amounts of military action, political affairs, violence against citizens, and unnatural powers. Some of characters traits can be retaliated when comparing these shows and both have something to do with the destruction of a once powerful country. 
Both have the main character go on a very perilous journey which will effect the world.Both end up having to get help from other people along the way.Both deal with aspects of loyalty, friendship, hardship, trust, etcBoth have great story lines, that have great character development.Both have great fight scenes.Code Geass revolves more around mechas. I was not a huge mecha fan however I loved Code Geass.Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood (FMAB) revolves more around magic. I did not have any preconceived notions of what to expect from FMAB and I loved the anime.If you are on the fence watch the first 5-10 episodes. If you liked one of these anime I can almost guarantee that you will be hooked. I love both of these anime and if you like one, you will almost with out a doubt like the other. read more 
While these series are very different they are also very alike. There is a certain percentage of people that like one and not the other but the vast majority of people will like both a lot. The main difference is that Code Geass has some plot holes while Fullmetal Alchemist is basically flawless in that regard. However these are both shounens which offer a little more than just fighting. Code Geass is both dumber and smarter while Fullmetal Alchemist is way more serious as well as slower. That doesn't change the fact that these are both excellent series and I recommend watching both of them if you like shounens or if you like the world at war concept from either Fullmetal (the whole ishbalan plot) or Code Geass (Britannia ruling the world). read more 
Both have conspiracy by the governers and supernatural aspect. They are about same length as a series. They both are non-filer and doesn't contain unnecessary scenes in order to keep story fluesnt. Action scenes are similarly attractive as FMA:B combat's are based on alchemy and Code Gaeass combat's are mecha echol but not your typical lame fight scenes 
Both are animes that deserve the adjective epic, in every sense.To be more specific, both feature a really great plot, great characters and amazing action scenes. In CG mechas and strategy are the stars in action scenes, while in FMA:B that rol belongs to alchemy (and a bit of strategy too). Both animes have a really great ending and you will be rating them with a 9 or 10 before the end. 
Both anime's are about a country and it's politics and main character being really involved with it, also both main characters have a special 'power'. 
Even though it doesn't have the technology and mechs, Alchemy is a pretty good replacement, and some hardcore alchemy would be a replacement to Geass. However, the main thing about Code Geass is the complex plot, involving politics and human relations, with interesting twists. And you can find all these things on Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. A very intelligent anime.  
Honestly, if you're a fan of brotherhood, you're going to enjoy Code Geass. Heck, you're going to love Code Geass whether you liked Brotherhood or not (unless you're some anime fan poser, but I have no idea where that'll get you in life - probably the same place the real anime fans end up - nowhere)I'm really bad at this so..... PASTA!!!!!!!!Anyway, check out Code Geass if you want to see the world in a different light and yes, Lelouch is the smartest character in all of anime. This is a must watch for any fan.  
1) Has the same kind of plot. Both MC want to rebuild their country. Lelouch to rebuild Britannia, meanwhile Edward & gangs to rebuild Amestris.  
Both involve a main with an extraordinary power that they use to change the government and achieve their goals. Additionally, both have a plot with many twists that keep you interested. 
Here's a military drama with great narrative pacing, brilliant voice acting, amazing action sequences, and a fantastic script for the majority, if not all, of characters involved. Honestly as one of the best anime ever made. 
Both FMAB and Code Geass has a protagonist who loves his sibling, owning a powerful ability, lost of politics, war, goverment supression againts a certain race, genocide, horrors of war, and a main antagonist with a world-changing goal. "
1575,30,15,"both have mecha both are deep in different ways and surpass the standard mecha anime  
The most obvious common theme between the two is the use of mecha.  The two anime have the exact same type of design for their mechas.Both really just have the same feel in terms of themes, too. 
Code Geass and Neon Genesis Evangelion are both high quality, riveting, mecha anime. Both series deal with politics, warfare, and psychology. They both discuss subjects such as human nature, the meaning of life and happiness, and sorrow and insanity. Both anime have fantastic soundtracks, great voice acting, and beautiful, sharp artwork.Both anime also contain much symbolism, some drawing its roots from religious symbols (although this is much more prevalent in Evangelion).Both of these anime have very memorable characters and great development.*Both are highly recommended.  
First off. There's a lot to what makes Evangelion and Code Geass similar.1. Obviously both series have Mechas and are piloted.2. Shinji and Lelouch are protagonists with psychological and emotional conflict. Both have daddy issues and are haunted by dark pasts and have ideals.3. Rei and C.C. Emotionless girls with serious importance to the story.4. Kallen and Asuka. Both hot headed girls with troubled pasts.5. Enemies and organizations like SEELE, Britannia, Nerv, Black Knights etc.6. Sci-fi elements like Angels, Geass, Eva's, Knightmares.7. Similar themes. Topics about human nature, what's right and wrong. Some symbolic scenes, Justice, psychological topics, secrets and conspiracy.In conclusion. Both are a must watch quality Anime's. Can't miss out on both. read more 
It's related do to the fact that each character running a different robot has a meaning and only certain people can use such robots and they are working for an organization to stop them. 
What can i say about these anime!Epic plot, amazing characters, memorable moments...Masterpieces that everyone should see.Mecha, action, drama,... 
They both have Giant Fighting Robots and hot girls. 
Both are a coming-of-age story following the development of a central male character; a battle to save humanity/society from a menacing group of marauding giant monsters 
The deconstruction genre is present in allot of anime for primarily short periods of time.Code Geass has allot of elements and feelings that represent Evangelion in a few ways. Although, the protagonist differ from one another, both Evangelion and Code Geass come very close in the long term for just general deconstruction in the anime's themselves.  
Both of these shows are excellent psychological animes. The mechas in both are insanely epic. One other similarity I found is that both have the monumental choice of accepting or rejecting God 
Apart from the obvious mech aspect, they're both highly intelligent animes that are full of mystery, often doing things you didn't expect. They both have a very 'grand' nature to them, slowly moving up from a small contained world story into something that blows all proportions out of the water. Both being a ride from start to finish, they both seem to have a very well thought out story structure, as well as the occasional comedic episode to keep things balanced. 
Too many Neon Genesis Evangelion fans make the mistake of not immersing themselves in Code Geass, which is objectively better than this show. It's a hard bar to set with Evangelion being so good and so inspirational in pop culture, but if you weren't huge on the hidden messages in Evangelion and more its psychological and action elements, Code Geass is a masterpiece every evangelion fan will adore. 
While both my seem to be a mech show on the surface about a teen both have many philosophy’s behind them and show much more depth than you think of a typical mech show as both have very psychological themes between one another. That being said both shows are brilliantly done well and are very enjoyable to watch and both have very good cast of characters and drama to go with one another and both shows have great action scenes that complement each other well. 
it really messes with your head in a simualre way and its hard to choose which is better out of the two for me 
The series are both brilliant and depressed. "
1575,5040,7,"Main character who outsmarts all of his foes (and allies). One Outs is basically all about strategies and interesting psychological tricks, and very entertaining for those who enjoy the 'battle of wits' aspect of Code Geass, Death Note and other similar anime. 
My recommendation is One Outs.  Now, you may be asking yourself, ""Wait. How could a baseball anime possibly be ANYTHING like Code Geass?""  The answer is simple--the main characters are both are master strategists who cannot be outwitted by their enemies. Tokuchi Toua has the same cold, meticulous and ruthless method of plotting as Lelouch, and he manages to outsmart even the most sinister of opponents.  They are antiheroes who the viewer can vastly admire.  As far as the baseball in One Outs, it's only a means of conveying Toua's talents to manipulate his opponents and predetermine how others around him will respond to a situation.  Even if you don't like baseball, if you can enjoy seeing how a strategist works out his next move, you will probably like this series--perhaps even more so if you like the premise of a master gambler.   read more 
Both protagonists are the cold calculating type, I recommend One Outs even if you hate baseball.  
This accounts both R1 and R2, This may seem like a strange recommendation to those who watched either one. Looking deeper I recommended these two because they both revolve around human psychology and how to manipulate them.I love both and what i can say is when Tokuchi(one outs protag.) is one the field the game their playing is no longer baseball it depicted more as a war. 
Both feature main characters who are rather heartless. They're calculating and gain enjoyment from making their enemies squirm as they fall under the boot of imminent defeat. They are capable of throwing away everything and anything to ensure victory, taking risky gambles in tough situations. Always under pressure from their superiors, they come across as an underdog that you can really get behind because of the entertaining methods they employ whilst overcoming opposition.  
Both MC is a good strategian. Lelouch is very similiar to Tokuchi. Just watch it and you will know... 
in a way both mc are smart like extreamly smart and are always one step ahead of there enemies "
1575,1,5,"Cowboy Bebop earns its reputation for its combination of fighting and original character matchings, as does Code Geass. If you liked Spike, Zero takes it to a much larger scale when Spike's close range combat is bought into the scale of international war. 
The strength of these shows lies in the charming and cool characteristics that the protagonist exudes. Spike from Cowboy Bebop is exhibits the chill and relaxed type of cool, while Lelouch from Code Geass shows more charisma and passion in his goals. Also, both shows have fights in different mode, such as gun fights, mecha fights (in CB, it's space ship), and clash of ideals. Did I mention that both are made by Sunrise? 
Both feature laid back formidable main characters (Lelouch & Spike). Both have sci-fi influence and amazingly designed mecha/machinery. Both characters have a mysterious past intrinsic to the plot of the show.  
Arguably the top notch shows of their era that defines their quality and writing.The main protagonists Lelouch and Spike are characters that you can relate in real life unlike standard anime.The themes of both shows really touch my heart to the point that it feels mature to the point that I can apply in real life.Even a non anime fan can take these shows a shot so that limited selection can be shown to those who have an avid interest.Definitely recommend one or the other if you saw one. 
Although Code Geass and Cowboy Bebop are vastly different, skilful in their own respect Lelouch and Spike set off with their right-hand man, Jet and C.C. along an incredible journey filled with great action, and the many different abstract books that of people create for themselves.Both are great sci-fi anime classics both brought to you by the studio Sunrise. "
1575,16498,5,"Perpetually-pissed protagonists with mommy issues. One of them protects his sister and the other is protected by his sister. If you find one of them compelling then you will find the other compelling. Both also have exceedingly slow paces.  
the characters, the animation, the plot and music everything is just perfect. Shingeki no kyojin is full of gore and violence but is justified. The scenes can get quite intense so if you don't like gore then it will be better if you avoid watching it. The characters those are well established can die as well and that is what makes it more realistic. 
Both are serious animes with mature themes, focused on war, with a lot of blood spilled. Both animes are about fighting for freedom against greater power, in SNK case Titans, in Code Geass case empire that control most of the planet. In both cases main protagonist has some kind of a superpower that allows him to fight the undefeatable enemy.  
A disturbed balance. Attack on Titan and Code Geass understand characters who want to fight the life they once lived in the past, through these tales, these characters grow with a strong desire to collapse the opposing force that wishes to give them otherwise.Eren and Lelouch join their respective teams to fight for the respect of human lives, Eren joining the Survey Crops, Lelouch becomes Zero, founding the Black Nights.Both are great action-military anime with epic fights around every corner, whether it be a mind game or physical action. 
Both series have alot of interresting political drama. They both also have complex plots with many plot twists.  "
1575,10087,4,"Both of these series involve loads of chracters making intricate plans against each other for various motivations. There is action and a supernatural element in both. Code Geass has a lot of high school age characters while Fate/Zero mostly involves adults, and there are more not-so-serious episodes in Code Geass. Code Geass has mechs while Fate/Zero has swords and sorcery. But they both have more plotting and gambits than you can count. If you like that aspect of one, you'll almost certainly like the other. 
In both anime the main character have a similar objetive, change the world. They know they can´t do it only with nice words so they are prepared to make sacrifices even if it means losing someone close they care/like/love. 
Both shows have ideological conflicts and personal ideals. 
Masterminds engaged in a tactical fight with some extra spice, mechas in CG and magic in Fate/.Both shows their respective worlds as morally gray, no one is 100% good or bad. "
1575,9253,3,"Both share a main character blessed (or cursed) with a special power. Allowing them to change the world. Or try to... Awesome soundtrack, character development, an impossible romance, lots of plot twists, incredible seiyus (voiceovers). In the end you can't stop watching this after 4-5 episodes, you're hooked and need to finish it off =) 
Perhaps not the most obvious recommendation, those who appreciate an interesting concept spearheaded by an ultra-charismatic lead character will probably appreciate Code Geass and Steins;Gate. Both shows, while having several flaws, are probably the two best examples of an anime riding its narrative momentum to sail above their shortcomings. They are not the same in their concepts, but they are very similar in their goals regarding the impact it looks to have on the viewer. 
are two incredible anime that have a similar atmosphere. although the history is different you can easily compare the two "
1575,13601,3,"- Both has an unjust justice system that almost does not give a damn about victims and casualties..- Both does not shy from showing you death mercilessly- Both anime shows some MC that defy the current laws and standard of society. 
Both have the same premise of bringing down a corrupt government and questions whether it's better to bring it down from outside or work from within to change it. Both have psychological and ideological themes that will have you thinking about for a long time after you've finished watching and make a point to confuse you about whether the ends or the means are correct (Code Geass is more emphatic on this) and that not everything is black and white (well duh): you'll have to reflect and decide on your own about what you think is right.As for differences, Psycho-Pass lacks the super-powered piloted robots in Code Geass but makes up for it using ""Dominators"" (huge badass guns, basically). Psycho-Pass surpasses CG in terms of artwork and animation by far, however. PP also doesn't mess up its characters arcs like Code Geass (although CG's first season is better than the second in terms of this). read more

Together they venture for their goals. If you like main characters that think of elaborate, well-though out plans, these anime are worth a watch. Although Spice and Wolf is leaning towards Romance. The main plot may differ by a lot, but the idea is somewhat similar if you look at it. Also, both Male MC's are voiced by the same VA, which makes it that much awesome.  
Spice and Wolf is just Code Geass, but with farming and economics. "
1575,11061,2,"HxH and Code Geass have a few things in common. But what really draws in the same fans are the tactical mind games that are played in both anime. Surely some shounen and superpowers are a nice addition to that, which only reinforces this recommendation! 
have great story and action packed. The characters are developed nicely as the story progresses. "
1575,38691,2,"These anime both focus on a genius main character Lelouch & Senku respectively. They both take heavy inspiration from and are essentially set it our world's own future (the ""real"" world). The OST's and art styles for both are absolutely incredible and the characters & character designs are charming, lovable, engaging and relatable. Both series are also great at making you root for characters who may even have questionable motivations and ethics. 
Longing for the new age. Code Geass and Dr Stone follow genius MCs on their quest to change the shape of the world after some catastrophic event.After the war on Japan, Lelouch decides to take down the Britannia empire in their tyrannical reign.

But what realy makes these series similar are the characters. Griffith=Lelouch because they are the tactitian  and guts=Suzaku because they are the soldier. Both have similar plots of trust issues, romantic tension, glorified battle scenes, and commanders trying to get revenge and rule the world.

Mind games commence. The Promised Neverland and Code Geass knows no bounds with mind games, both anime follow seemingly physically weak protagonists fight against the dangers that overpower their world through mind games, and combined strength teams can make.Code Geass has Lelouch rebel against Britannia for their tyrannical reign, while TPN has the Grace Field children fight survive the mysterious creatures that control from behind.Both are great anime with awesome mind games from all parties involved. "

So:+ Both have wide cast of developed characters+ Both are very dynamic and active animes+ Both are interesting to watch, as lot of unexpected staff happensOn the minus note:- Both aren't as smart as they may seem at first glance- Both lose their logic more as the show goes onAnyway, if you are not hardcore thinker (i am hardcore thinker only after anime ends, heh), and like interesting and active shows - both are great at those terms "

164,457,15,"They pretty much share the same mentality regarding nature and spiritual life, both being influenced by the supernatural. The overall atmosphere is also the same with incredible scenery and hauntingly beautiful music. The most simple things turn out to be miracles of life.  
Both anime revolve around the spiritual aspect of nature and are rooted in Shinto beliefs.  
Both deal with the supernatural and the relationships between humans and the world they inhabit. 
Both are situated in an old Japanese era.Both main characters looking after the spirits of nature. 
Both are themed on plant, forest, animal, supernatural! 
Both cover the spiritual world of old Japan, and watching Mushishi helps western people understand Princess Mononoke better. 
A beautiful anime about relationship between human being and nature. 
Mushishi and Mononoke Hime explore nature in a fantasy setting.With their themes, both anime adapt a mystical background with ingredients of a tale involving characters that get themselves involved with supernatural beings. They also present a powerful background with a natural outlook of its nature.The soundtracks are smooth ones that retain a serene-like feeling with minimal comedy. Character relationships are explored and the laws of nature with humans and beasts are also emphasized. 
Both are filled with serene backgrounds and music and stress the theme of mankind's balance with nature and the spiritual aspects it possesses.  
they both possess something soft and mature about them. supernatural, fantasy, and adventure. they have a very smooth transgression, get you thinking, and have a bittersweet feel to them. 
Both share themes of nature, humanity, and the cycle of birth and death. Mononoke Hime has spirits of the forest, gods, demons... These are very similar to the mushi of Mushishi, with the main character of Mushishi also trying to find a balance between humans and nature, the same way Askitaka does. Both have gorgeous scenery and animation, with heavy emphasis on natural surroundings.  
The atmosphere is very similar. Both deal with nature, the supernatural, and what is the very core of all life itself.  
Both stories are about the coexistence of people and nature. Both using supernatural metaphors - spirits of nature - to tell the story. 
They both have an incredibly similar world and atmosphere. An older time in the forests of Japan where there are themes of the spirits of nature and humans living in harmony.  
Beautiful scenery and similar theme of respecting nature and humanity's place alongside it, even though nature can be dangerous and frightening. "
164,199,5,"Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke are epic films by Hayao Miyazaki that will leave an imprint on you in some way or another.  Truly unforgettable. 
Both have very good storyline to support a successful movie.But the part that makes it less successful (this is just my opinion), is the fail of an ending both of these movies have.Still great movies....until the post-post climax portions. 
Both were made by Studio Ghibli, and have girls as main characters . Both almost equal in length and are movies. They are both very good. I recommended checking both out. 
made by the same guy Hayao Miyazaki. He makes great anime movies that will leave you wanting more, I can't say that I didn't enjoy watching all of the movies that were made by him. His movies are very creative and original, if you've seen one, you should check out some of his others, they are all just as good. His movies are so great that I even re watched some of them a few times. anyways if you're interested in one of his movies, you're almost guaranteed to like the others. see for yourself. 
I used to watch this a lot when I was younger- watching it now just makes me nostalgic and the characters are unique with great artwork imo. "
164,34599,5,"Made in Abyss has a very ""Ghibli"" feel, with an eerie feeling, and a lush, rich world and deep characters and story. More mysterious than Princess Mononoke but if you like one you should check out the other.  
The environement's details and creatures are very similar.Global vibes are very similar: poetic, but dynamic. 
Similarities: The mysteries of their worlds and the way they explore them in both, from the designs of; the creatures, the environments and even the characters. I mean, San's design obviously helped inspire the design of Nanachi, Ashikaga's curse to Regu's cyborg arms and even Lady Eboshi antagonistic beliefs to Ouzen's own antagonistic beliefs. Even the stories are alike; a tale of a journey to found something/someone (with Mononoke Hime, a cure for Ashikaga's curse and with Made in Abyss, Riko's mother).  
Made in Abyss feels like a Ghibli movie that was written by a sadist. Boasts an Art Director, Osamu Masayuma, who has worked on various Ghibli films too, so the art is just as fantastic and captivating. 
Vivid and detailed natural environment, a setting organic to the plot mixing more down-to-earth elements with supernatural ones. Both anime play around with the more apathetic, dangerous and less softer aspects of nature.Of course, one is a movie another a series, and the character designs of MiA are of the chibi style instead of the realistically proportioned Ghibli ones.  "
164,2418,4,"Both these movies are set in a similar kinda time period (the beginings of guns and gunpowder) with Princess Mononoke being more fantasicalAlso they both deal with the conflict of ideals and loyalty. 
Armies clash around two characters, who, while they don't trust each other at first, try to make sense of the world. Both deal with the same themes during approximately the same time period. Mononoke is more fantasy, Stranger is slightly more realistic/grittier.  
Both movies are set during the late Middle Ages in Japan and feature action with a good variety of pre-modern weapons (e.g matchlocks, spears and bows). Their differences lie in themes; Princess Mononoke is a semi-historical fantasy that focuses on nature vs man conflict (between a forest's denizens and a society of outcasts), whereas Sword of the Stranger is a ronin adventure that focuses even more on action and on feudal wars (including conflict between Ming mercenaries and locals). 
Both take place in same period. There is a relationship between the MCs of not trusting each other at the beginning. There are fights, not only duels but also with armies, which are well animated. Princess mononoke is more fantastical and sword of the stranger, more realistic "

At their cores, both Mononoke and Erin are about our relationship with nature, and both create convincing and fantastic worlds that we feel strongly connected to. It is through these worlds that we understand the various characters' motivations and points of view. Due to its format as a TV series,  Kemono no Souja Erin is able to paint a deeper emotional tone than Mononoke. And like Mononoke, Erin has a mature, engrossing story that respects its audience, never cheapens the experience with common anime tropes.

I love all of his movies, Princess Mononoke being my favorite, but out of all his movies, this one is my second favorite. The animation is great as well as the characters.

As other recommendations have said, these shows were made by the same studio and have too many similar qualities to count.

Similarities include:- a revenge-motivated protagonist with unique natural ability for combat- similar protagonists as a whole. honestly- blurred moral lines- violence- similar art and combat scenes- unique setting.

Vinland Saga (in addition to Owari no Seraph which has many recommendations that you should check out) is made by Wit Studio.- wit studio tends to animate lots of manga/lightnovels that have similar genres. -art style similarThe protagonists of VS and SnK are both soooo annoying. -They each have something they want to kill:Eren=titans, cause they killed his mom Thorfinn= askella,  because he (his followers) killed his dad.-Askellad and Levi are very similar. Cold asf, don't mind killing everything in their path, dark pasts, etc. -lots of killing 
Perfectly matches each other for revenge. In Attack on titan, Eren Jaeger seeks revenge for his mothers death and the destruction of his home town done by the human eating giants known as ""Titans"" He sweared to kill every single Titan to bring the freedom of all the people inside the huge walls they used to live in for protecting themselves from Titans. Again, in Vinland Saga Thorfinn seeks revenge for his fathers death by killing Askellad,who killed him. In future both of them starts to know their own identities clearly and the past life of their people. 
These two anime series are actually from the same company! I feel like Vinland saga is underrated because of Shingeki. Don't get me wrong, Shingeki is amazing but I really liked Vinland as much as I did for Shingeki. They are both action animes with Vinland Saga being a historical anime about vikings. Both have very deep messages and.. oh gosh.. a lot of killing. Anyways, plz watch Vinland! (also, can't wait for season 2!)  
both are in medieval settings, badass characters, brutal action, good world building 
A wonderful combination of good story line with outstanding action. It tells the journey of young boy who is thrown into difficult circumstances due to war. The best thing is the anime is loosely based on history. It is a highly underrated anime if you like dark action genre. If you've watch Attack On Titans , you simply cannot miss this.  
If you like the bloody complex and grounded politics and action of Attack On Titan, you will most likely love Vindland Saga 
The same studio that animated snk, the main character is so cold and has a monstrous development throughout the anime. The protagonist is also an unparalleled genius, always one step ahead of the others "
37521,33,8,"If you like realistic in anime standarts fight scenes but don't really like shounen style fighting scenes -you know, in most of the shounen fights, characters moves so fast and talks so much while fighting and this kills mood- and also like some darkness in the story then good for you o/ you gonna love these two animes.If you liked Vinland Saga, you gonna like Berserk too. Same goes other way around. 
Vinland Saga and Berserk both take place during similar time periods. They both have gritty settings and both stories remain quite psychological. They're both layered shows with good character development that has real depth. 
The action scenes in both anime are very similar although Berserk would be considered a dark fantasy and Vinland Saga is considered Historical Fiction. They have very similar themes with both of the main protagonists being from destitute backgrounds.  
Gritty, action packed, medieval anime about a young, battle hardened main character seeking revenge. 
Both Berserk's Golden Age arc and Vinland primarily deal with medieval warfare, strategy, and politics. Both series have mostly gray character designs, but not for all characters. E.g. Thorkell in Vinland and Adon Coborlwitz in Berserk are stereotypical shounen characters. Vinland's Thorfinn is borderline between angry shounen edgelord and seinen gray, more so then Bererk's Guts. Vinland lacks the romance and supernatural aspects Berserk has, and puts more emphasis on the political dimension instead. The coverage of military action is similar. 
both are very dark and are placed in the middle ages 
Both are very dark and set in medieval times. Both characters driven by revenge.  
Both have strong philosophies about war, success, life and death. Set in medieval era in Europe. Include strong charismatic characters and amazing stories. "
37521,10937,3,"Both Thorfinn and Casval serve the murderers of their fathers, making a name for themselves as skilled merciless warriors on the battlefield in the hopes of an opportunity to take revenge upon their own leaders.Thorfinn lived humbly with under a caring father Thors, a Jomsviking war hero. We see his childhood as having fun, enjoying a naïve conception of fighting and war. They are forced to leave their life of peace and this impacts Thorfinn the most. Eventually, he joins Askeladd's band of Vikings to fight the Saxons, yet retaining his vengeful agenda.Casval, on the other hand was the son of a powerful political figure and his family was center stage in their home colony and must adapt to the life-threatening situation he's put in when his father is assassinated. Eventually, he enrolls the Zeon's military academy to fight the Earth Federation, with a secret agenda to change the Zeon government that corrupted his father's name and ideology. read more 
Historical setting and Space opera heavy on war drama. Protagonists start as kids who, as a result of certain similar event,  develope  an interesting talent for war in their teen years and polish them for purpose of revenge.  
Revenge! It is the topic when starting the plot. Both protagonists will do whatever it takes to fulfill their objective, regardless of joining the side that has hurt them so much.Both present powerful protagonists (in their field) in addition to great battles. Plus: They also present their dose of ....Betrayal!!!. "
37521,39535,3,"Just gives off a very similar world building via superb visuals. The main character are also alike, although they fight for different reasons. Its hard to explain why both of thm give such a similar vibe as VS is not an Isekai but once you have watched either one of them and the first episode of the other you will know what I mean 
Fantasy world with great direction and slower pacing and very good writing. The MC isn't overpowered and you see constant growth both in power levels as well as a character. Side characters aren't 1 dimensional and have their own faults and issues.While not as realistic as Vinland Saga, Mushoku Tensei touches some very real themes. 
Both are anime that greatly expresses how one cope with trauma. One (Rudy) who is always bullied so he just chose to be alone and never wanting to leave their house, and one (Thorfinn) who witnessed the death of his father and is trying to get revenge. "
37521,40682,1,"In both anime there are: * Brutal worlds where characters have to kill to stay alive.* Revenge for the lost ones. * Beautiful visuals. So if you like the elements mentioned you should definitely check them out.  "
245,918,14,"Apart from the main characters being completely random, both series having re-occurring characters and a similar style of humor, there are not too many similarities. However, if you like either of these series, your almost guaranteed to love the other! Both start out fairly slow, so watch at least the first 5 episodes and you WILL be hooked. 
If you liked Onizuka Eikichi from GTO as a main character, then you're definitely going to like Sakata Gintoki from Gintama. Everything they do from riding 2-wheeled transportation devices(I hesitate to call Gin-san's old scooter a bike) to nose-picking to ass-whopping make me think that they must be brothers from different universes. And if you liked GTO's awesome mix of comedy, action, life lessons, occasional ecchi, and problem-solving, then you should give Gintama a shot, because it is all that with a heavy dose of parody thrown in just for kicks. 
Light-headed/carefree main characters, great humor and both animes giving you the chance to review/edit your opinion about life and stuff to do with it. 
Both main characters:*Act like scum.*Can do awkward things without shame*Epic speeches*Overpower pretty much all fights*lazy*scum perverts*have perverted scum fantasies*really really caring of their friends*everyone is drawn to them mystically*hopeless losers*dead fish eyes*make stupid ugly hilariously drawn faces*wear other anime costumes*prioritizes doing the moral thing over importance*both animes don't do cliched things to drag the story*makes you tear up when people discover the heroic things they did*great episodic arc stories*gets mad easilyWhoops, I kept going on. Well you understand how much I love both of these. 
Although these two anime is not similar in plot, the funny moments will remind you again again of each other. If you liked one of them then you are surely to like the other. 
In both anime, the main characters have a dangerous past and are trying to be good in the present. Humour present in both are comparable. 
Both protagonists are helping people with their problems in a similar ""self-sacrificing"" way. Gintama gets real good around after around episode 60, but its so worth it 
They are similar in terms of:-Main character are both late twenties, odd ball, lazy, crazy but they can be very serious when the moment asks for it-Can give you a good laugh as well as a good lesson-There is a bit of action but Gintama has more action 
-Extremely funny-Great episodic arc stories -Epic speeches -Pervert characters  
This anime is very hilarious and i recommended for watch, if you like comedies. Тhank you for your attention 
A anime that will make you laugh and teach us life lessons to understand how this world works. 
- Both MC's are haunted by their past but appear to be goofy- Actual good comedy with a few serious parts here and then- GTO is less dark compared to Gintama 
Onizuka and Gintoki are both the lowest person from Status quo's view but as a humans they are the best, they understand others' feelings and help them realize it. both are very very funny but when the time comes they become more serious then anyone else. In the end they both teaches us to leave according to our own will 
they are both comedy anime with serious scenes and also have similar paradies including doreamon "
245,170,8,"both animes are from the 90's hence they have the same art style. both main characters are delinquents trying to change to be good. they are very funny and memorable characters and will make you come back for more. 
It's not GTO at all, and the theme is different, but the two main characters resemble each other greatly. These two anime have the same feel and pacing to them. 
if you watch GTO for onizuka, you'll  probably like sakuragi hanamichi. Hanamichi is as dumb as, as direct as, as insane as, as inhuman as, as simple minded as Onizuka. Two of them approach to events is so funny and direct.Hanamichi<=Onizuka... 
If you enjoy Slam Dunk, you will likely enjoy GTO and vice versa. They are both classic anime comedies with a large fan base. Well written characters that you can't help but love and cheer for and a hooking plot that keeps you coming back for more. There are lessons to be learned and inspiring moments to be had in both animes. Overall, similar art and feel as well but this is also characteristic of the times when the animes were made. 
The main viibes from the main character are more than similar to Onizuka. Both of them are quite idiots but reliable when needed 
Similar comedy, both are circled around delinquents that try to find success one way or another in the real world. Mostly importantly, both are amazing and very enjoyable. 
SCHOOL SETTING WITH ECCENTRIC MALE LEAD. You can feel a strong and funny friendship in both 
Both are some of the greatest 90's classics, would definitely recommend to check out both anime and manga series as they are both incomplete adaptations. "
245,263,6,"Although the stories are completely different, the style of comedy and animation are quite similar.  
There is a nice balance between comedy and action.Both truely unforgettable. And allthough the action is awesome, and sometimes over the top. They stay realistic. The story lines are also close to reality. Everything you see could have happend in real life.Also, you'll notice while watching the series, that you'll really start to look up to the main character. Especially Onizuka from GTO. That guy will earn your respect for sure. 
The stories of Great Teacher Onizuka and Hajime no Ippo may be different, but the comedy is explosive with its well-presented dialogues. There is significant character development in both series as their perspectives unfolds.Artwork-wise, both series share similarities in their crude drawing that illustrate a sense of masculinity, especially for our main male protagonists. As both series progress, they gain friends, rivals, and admirers based on respect/friendship/relationships.Both series also display realism that can be relatable.  
Great (in a way comparable) main character. Over the top humor but can be emotional when you least expect it.Both story are written really well. 
While the plots of these anime are different, they have quite a few similarities. First off, the art style is quite similar. Secondly, they have the same kind of humor, and emotional scenes when you least expect them. They also have similar action scenes and character development. Finally, they also have character you'll look up to. 
Older shows are just the greatest, are they not? First, Hajime no Ippo & Great Teacher Onizuka both have a VERY similar type of comedy, the type I love & the type that keeps me dying from laughing... Both have a really similar character; Takamura & Onizuka, once you watch both you will know how they're similar, very similar. Overall, both shows are very similar & amazing. "
245,32182,4,"Reigen Arataka and Onizuka are highly similar in character: People who at first glance, would seem like swindlers or frauds. More than that, what makes them similar is, they genuinely care for their sidekicks/students and are ready to protect them from any harm that they may encounter. Imo, both Reigen's design, as well as character, is heavily inspired by Onizuka. Both also possess that subtle charisma and self-confidence that makes viewers like them. 
Onizuka and Reigen are basically the same people except Onizuka is cooler lol but both are as hilarious and dopey as one another and are senseis 
-Both has main characters who are damn funny Onizuka and Reigen, Aratakaand both shows consist of comedy and have someone who wants to protect others. 
Combine Reigen Arataka's cunning and character design with Mob's ""saving the day,"" and you get Eikichi Onizuka. GTO also has a similar master-apprentice vibe. I recommend watching it.  "
245,30654,3,"Education, Slice of Life, Betrayal, Drama - these genres fit the full package in getting you hyped-up to watch this Anime non-stop! The main protagonist, Eikichi Onizuka, personalities are quite similar to the protagonist, Koro-Sensei, from Ansatsu Kyoushitsu anime; Despite the setting of the story, they are both comical from just their facial expressions alone to the insane actions they performed. They both share similar goals as to help students, striving them to walk the right path in life and giving the audience a sense of thoughts on their real life. Both teacher encounters disadvantage and challenging situation all for the sake of their students despite the consequences whether it's from an illogical or a logical standpoint.If you have the same feeling where you would want Koro-Sensei as a teacher in real life then this anime is the perfect anime for you to watch. This Anime will leave you a nostalgic moments for the rest of your life! read more 
While Ansatsu is more focused on the various students of class 3-E denpa kyoushi is more focused on Onizuka the god like pervy teacher.The former cashes on the various neat tricks and comedy involving the  daily intercourse of the teacher and the class the latter exploits the daily gimmicks of onizuka who has a devil may care attitude about everything.As a whole GTO is a more entertaining watch than Ansatsu kyoushitsu. 
Both anime have a great teacher,though Ansatsu Kyoushitsu is somewhat supernatural compared to GTO they both show the relation of student with their teacher. "
245,1,3,"The anime themselves aren't really alike at all, however if you liked the main character of one, you'll like the other. They're both funny and great in a fight, and overall feel almost like the same character. 
If Spike Spiegel was a teacher... 
If you like the talents of Wendee Lee and Steve Blum (credited as David Lucas in Onizuka) then you would love Cowboy Bebop since they both give the same great voice performances. "
245,1210,2,"Both series have about the same comedy-drama ratio (well at least for the first half of NHK, it later turns to mostly drama). Both also deal with many serious issues, but never fail to deliver on humor either. Also both series have something other comedies usually don't, a heart. There's a real heart to them both. Also both series have some pervy humor in them, but also other types as well.  Also I just think both series would apeal to the same type of person. There is a difference however. NHK relies on a lot of dark homor, and turns into more of a drama then anything else, and it;s truly for the better. It becomes a much better show for it. GTO doesn't use dark humor, and never really turns into a drama, but it does get a little more serious as it goes on.  read more 
Both of them have similar points, except that NHK is more dramatic, and has more painful parts to watch, when GTO is more of the funny side. GTO is definitely a must-watch for all you psychological lovers who want to watch something that doesn't feel like wasting time. You might find yourself looking 20 episodes straight. Well.. thats what happened to me on both anime. ^ ^ "
457,4081,76,"Natsume and Mushishi are both about the interaction between spirits and humans and nature. Both shows do an amazing job with the storytelling, the characters, and playing with your emotions. If you liked one, you'll surely like the other. 
Both of the main characters can see spirits. Both series are episodic, they can be watched in almost any order. Both have a lot of drama packed into these short stories. 
Deals with the supernatural and very episodic. Has the same calm, bittersweet atmosphere at the end.  
Though the two have their differences, both are about a main character who can see something others can't, and strives to help them. Also, both stories have a certain almost laid-back atmosphere to them. Natsume Yuujinchou, however, has more of a plot than Mushishi, as well as supporting characters that stay for more than one episode. 
If you liked Mushishi I believe you'll most definitely enjoy Natsume Yuujinchou. :) I could see similarities right off the bat, in how they both deal with spirits or other supernatural creatures. Both main characters have a sense of compassion when interacting with these entities, and often will try to find the least violent method of solution. Also, both series are episodic, yet it's a style that suits them well. The day-to-day solving of problems has a relaxing sort of mood in both series, and I think they complement each other nicely. 
Both deal with things that can only be seem by few people. Both have the main character helping someone in which only they could provide assistance. Each episode is about a different spirit/mushi.  
Spirits are all around us, but only some have the gift to see them. Both series are somewhat episodic, revolving around human interactions with spirits, as well as with each other. 
Both are calm, slice-of-life-ish series that deal with the supernatural (youkai/mushi) in one- or two-episode arcs and have protagonists who are quiet and standoffish as a result of their abilities to deal with the supernatural. 
Although not similar in the aspect of Japanese Youkai, Mushishi still has good Japanese environments and the obvious feature of spirits that can only seen by certain people. Not many blatant parallels can be made between the two, though there's a high chance that anyone who likes Natsume Yuujin-Chou will like Mushishi. 
If you liked Mushishi, you'll probably like Natsume Yuujinchou too. Each episode is a seperate story, and involves with spirits. The artwork of both of the series are soft colors and a pleasure to watch. Mushishi uses earthtones and Natsume Yuujinchou soft pastels though. 
Both wonderfully soothing atmospheric slice-of-life series involving male protagonists with the uncommon ability to see spirits. In the course of these episodic stories, we learn that these spirits are neither good nor evil, that they simply exist - a message both shows seem to reinforce. Mushishi tends to be more dramatic, whereas Natsume Yuujinchou carries more of a comedic touch. 
You'll surely notice since first episode how much those two anime are very similar to eachother.- Main character: a quiet, good and mature guy (Natsume and Ginko) which has to deal in his own way with spirits/mushi. They both care abouth the spirits and always tried to do everything to help them and not let people thinking that they are to be considered as ""evil"".- Atmosphere: colors, art, music, design will let you fully love the litterally pureness of those anime. The atmosphere is very calm and ""delicated"".Personally i think that both, Mushishi and Natsume Yuujinchou, are two masterpieces which you can't miss to watch, especially if you already enjoyed one of the two! read more 
Both anime have a calming atmosphere and tells the story of someone with a special ability as they learn to live with the supernatural. 
Except for the basic plot: odd things that only some people can see but still can affect many, the main characters are extemely siimilar. They are both easy-going, adorable guys that will try to do whats best depending on the situation rather than some idea that all unknown creatures are evil and needs to be exterminated. 
Both series are slow paced, and are focused on youkai, with standalone episodes. Natsume yuujinchou is lighter than Mushishi though. 
Similar classic Japanese spirit seer protagonist and mysterious bittersweet stories. 
Beautiful episodic tales surrounding the interaction between spirits and humans with a single mature and introspective male protagonist holding the thread between episodes.Mushishi focuses more on japanesse folklore tales in a rural fudal setting and its more moral driven, whetheras Nastume Yuujinchou is more quaint and simple, following a school boy and his spirit relationships. 
Mushihi's drama is more than Natsume Yuujinchou even though both they relax u a lot :) Both anime's story about a guy who wanna help ghosts ( it's name change anime to anime like Yokai & Mushi ) and humans. So they are similar in many ways :) 
Both anime are episodic and supernatural. They have a relaxing atmosphere. Though the protagonists are different, they are both able to see things that normal people can't see, mushi/spirits. 
Natsume yuujinchou's story have a similiarity to mushishi.. it all about japanesse mystery story.. 
Slow pace anime with magic creatures and epic story  
Both are one-shots that follows the life of one character (though Natsume's Book of Friends starts branching out more) and you will likely need a box of tissues. 
Both stories follow the main character, who can see strange things. Both series have the same atmosphere, though Mishishi seems to be a more mature. Both stories are warm, affecting and a little bit bittersweet. 
Calm, episodic anime with supernatural aspects. 
BOth anime somehow tackles the supernatural side (mushi and yokai) meeting new pwoplw along the way of their journey. Slow in pace but has lessons to give in ife. 
These dramas share a slow, easy pace that really allows them to develop a nice atmosphere. Watching these shows leaves me feeling peaceful and calm.They are both episodic. Nastume Yuujinchou centers around the main character meeting and helping a different spirit each episode. Mushishi is similar, having the main character meet and help someone with a spirit related problem each episode. 
The setting is famiiar - both main heroes can see otherwordly creatures, the atmosphere is quite the same too, although theese animes still leave different impressions. 
Mushishi and Natsume Yuujinchou both have many similarities. The main characters of shows are the only people that can see spirits. The MC's want to help the people and spirits throughout the series. There isn't much of a plot in both the shows but each episode is very emotional and dramatic.  
Both series have an episodic nature and are slow-paced with their stories. The story of both series focuses on dealing with the problems of individual people. In Natsume Yuujinjou this is done through the Book of Friends while in Mushishi it is the mushi that inhabit people. Both series have a large deal of emotions involved and also a large amount of moral questions are raised. 
Both are about interactions with supernatural entities and solving various problems caused by them. They are quite lighthearted but can be very serious and grim when they want to be. Very nice art, excellent soundtracks, and similar mood throughout. Mushishi is a bit more isolated and solitary.  
Both stories are about life with another being.Ayakashi in Natsume Yuujinchou are human like being, where Mushi are more like primitive beings.Both stories are focusing in slice of life and drama. But Natsume Yuujinchou is more slice of life, where Mushishi is more drama.Both are top tier class animes. 
Both series gives off a similar feeling in which the main protagonist is able to see supernatural beings where normal people cannot. Although lacking a direct story line, both series has very interesting concepts and ideas that tells a different story each episode. The episodes themselves are lighthearted and has a relaxing feeling to them. The way these two series tell their stories in a surreal and unique presentation. There are spirits involved in both series as we take a glimpse into how they behave around human beings and specifically the main protagonist. Although slow paced, the exploration of the many ideas are quite insightful to watch. read more 
both are relaxing anime in which the main character empathizes with other characters who they meet and try to help them. main character in both anime can see things that not many other people can (mushi/youkai) 
Got the same style as Natsume Yuujinchou, is a slice of life, adventure, but is quiet and relaxing and episodic , the anime style put you in calm mood and u always crave for more eps . 
Both are Slice-of-Life anime where the mc deals with supernatural (yokai/mushi) with kindness. Great light-hearted anime that you can watch and relax to. 
As many other people point out, this is as close to Mushishi as you can get. Both deal with Youkai/Ayakashi and are (mostly) episodic in nature, meaning there isn't necessarily a set overall plot, but a series of situations/problems where the entire story of it is contained in one episode, which Mushishi absolutely nailed. Natsume is definitely more heart-warming and emotional than Mushishi, but both will leave your heart tingling. 
Both main characters can see things that normal people can't, spirits. Witch a calm and peaceful feel to it, both main characters encounter both good and bad spirits, and helping those in need. Both main characters are pretty quiet, and are the loner type. When they were children, the were thought of a freaks for seeing things no one else could see.  After meeting different kinds of spirits their outlook about them and life changes. Both animes are episodic, with both good, sad, and bittersweet endings. 
Both anime have the same peaceful setting, and each episode there's a new mushi/ayakashi that our main character meets. Unlike other people who usually fear mushi/ayakashi, Natsume/Ginko (the MCs) try their best to understand them and their true nature.  
Both was able to features Japanese Folklore so well and interesting 
These are both calm and slow paced anime. The feeling of the show is the biggest similarity. Both center around the main character who can see things not everybody can, following events happening around these things. 
Natsume yuujinchou and Mushishi both have aspects of a character who can see supernatural things that very few people can see or understand. also both are slow paced mature anime 
Both have to do with spiritual creatures called ""yokai"". Both are very beautiful and imaginative anime. Highly recommend watching 
Both are series in which ghosts or spirits exist and only certain people can see them. They are both extremely relaxing to watch, the sort of thing you'd watch an episode of before you go to sleep to give yourself a nice dream. Although Mushishi occasionally has unhappy endings and has a more wistful and dreamy atmosphere compared to Natsume Yujinchou's ""smiley sunny everyone's friends lets help each other out and be happy"" kind of atmosphere in which comedy is occasionally added. In my opinion occasional unhappy endings are a good thing as it adds variety, and I guess it suits the feel of the anime so don't immediately cross Mushishi out. Most of the time each episode has it's own plot line, and one arc rarely continues for more than an episode's length. In this case that also adds to the relaxing effect because you don't have to follow an intricate story line. I personally find the most relaxing animes the ones where you don't have to think. Anyway, both animes are brilliant, personally I prefered Mushishi just because I like the strange lovecraft sort of atmospheres and the protagonist is pretty interesting, unlike your generic anime hero... read more 
main characters of these series are able to see spirits and go around solving problems. the two anime is also episodic which is smoothing and relaxing. japanese folklore 
The key fundamental similarity between both of these series is that they are both episodic, giving each individual episode it's own story arc which doesn't directly connect to other episodes much further than the recurring characters e.g. Ginko, Madara etc. They both center around the theme of the supernatural, both introducing fantasy creatures e.g. Mushi from Mushishi. Mushishi I would describe as more on the philosophical and harder watching side than Natsume Yuujinchou, which has a more of a Slice of Life feeling to it while still remaining thought provoking. They are both slow paced and minimalisitic animes with simple but beautiful animation (especially mushishi) but are probably best watched in moderation rather than 'marathoning' a series. Both Awesome and Original :) read more 
If you like Mushishi then I'm sure you will like Natsume. Because in both animes the plot and aura is very similar. There is spiritual things and myths of the Japan folk. I enjoy and liked so much Mushishi and Natsume. There are so relaxing, with beautiful soundtrack, nice main chatacters and with a fantasy mythology that involved the plot. Very recommended! 
Both centred around Youkai, slow paced story lines, and a great lot of character development and emotions.  
Both peaceful animeSimilar animeBoth relaxing 
Supernatural/ghosts; Protagonist is a special person who can see these supernatural things and helps others deal with them; both have a very chill and bittersweet feel and slice of life 
Similarities: both animes are largely episodic, both really only have a handful of main characters (although mushishi is mostly just Ginko), have a similar atmosphere about them and both main characters deal with helping people affected by spirits, or the spirits themselves. Differences: Natsume is set in modern day Japan and he lives in the countryside, Mushishi is set in the past and Ginko is a nomad. Natsume also deals with a more personified version of spirits (youkai/ayakashi), whereas mushishi's spirits (mushi) don't really have any character to them. Natsume also has more of a goal he wants to achieve (book of friends), unlike Ginko. Both are equally very enjoyable, and highly recommended. read more 
       Mushishi and Natsume Yuuchinjou are very good and enjoyable series. The protagonists of both series, Ginko and Natsume, deal with spiritual species that interact with humans, which are known as Mushi (Mushishi) and Ayakashi/Youkai (Natsume Yuuchinjou). Both Ginko and Natsume also deal with loneliness, but still use the gifts/powers they have to help others. They are episodic as well. Both characters accept these spirits as parts of their lives. Ginko before the beginning of the story's setting, and Natsume throughout the show.      However, there are still some differences between the two. For almost every episode of Mushishi, Ginko is usually requested to help a character that has a ""disease/illness"". He tries to diagnose the problem, and the cause of the problem is always because of the Mushi, in whatever way possible. Ginko then gets rid of the Mushi, but will never kill them, unlike other mushishi. In Natsume Yuuchinjou, Natsume usually helps either a youkai or human with a problem they have, and with those problems, most of the time, he has to use his Yuuchinjou. Mushishi episodes almost always end in a depressing or non-happy way. In Natsume Yuuchinjou, the story of that episode always has a happy ending. Ginko and maybe just one or two other characters reappear throughout the show. In Natsume Yuuchinjou, there are plenty of characters that appear along the way, humans and youkai. There's more comedic scenes in Natsume Yuuchinjou than in Mushishi as well.    In conclusion, both are very well-done series, and are very emotional. Natsume Yuuchinjou is very similar to Mushishi, but is less depressing and deals with more characters. read more 
Both Mushishi and Natsume Yuujinchou have a laid back, relaxing athmosphere and an episodical way of telling the different stories that each has to offer. Both shows deal with lead characters that can see creatures that others can't and their interaction with them.However, while Mushishi tends to be more dramatic, Natsume has a little more of a comedian touch to it. 
Supernatural creatures that both characters can see that others can not. Both series are soft and relaxing 
The Mushishi series and the Natsume Yuujinchou series are both relaxing series. Both involve protagonists who can see supernatural entities, who learn or have learned to deal with this ability as they grow older. Ginko makes it his life work to work with and deal with mushi (the supernatural entity in Mushishi) and Natsume learns to coexist with yokai whilst slowly learning about the world and politics around exorcists. They both are largely episodic in nature, with Natsume Yuujinchou having more overarching narratives. 
They are both about a Main Character that can see magical creatures (ayakashi and mushi).Both give a pleasant ride for the spectator, being an episodic kind of show, that follows a simple story line at times.Both are really good, and if you like one of them, it is a fact that you would like the other one. 
Both animes have a supernatural theme, yet are not packed with pure action and fights and such. They are slow-paced and look at things at a different perspective. Plus, the atmosphere in both is really calming and both are good animes to watch, if you want each episode a new story to be told. 
Both animes are about the main character meeting spiritual beings and solving problems related to those spiritual beings. Both are episodic animes . And in both anime only a few can see those spiritual beings . And both animes have a mysterious and calm atmosphere that makes it feel like its a great sol anime. 
Both these are really calming to watch it lifts your spirits. Natsume Yuujinchou has youkais while Mushishi has mushi both which impact their lives. They kind of have a soft warm lonely feeling to it. 
Both these animes focus on bringing the unseen world of yokai to life through vivid narration and interesting characters . 
Both are episodic spiritual adventures that give off the same vibe both having a bittersweet ending  
Supernatural anime series with a Japanese atmosphere, lots of very memorable episodes. 
both are about  mythical creatures and they are episodic animes following the life ofa young man and his relationship with these creatures also they are relaxing to watch 
They both involve characters that interact with spirts that most others can see. Both of them are more or less episodic, focusing in a different spirit each episode. MC does his best to help the spirit or those affected by the spirit. 
These convey an inner peace (equivalent to nirvana) and a sense of break from the busy monotony of contemporary society through the folklore japanese // Estos transmiten una paz interior (equivalente al nirvana) y una sensación de descanso de la bulliciosa monotonía de la sociedad occidental contemporánea a través del folclore japonés. 
Natsume Yuujinchou is basically Mushishi only with more laughs, more happy endings and a somewhat less fatalistic view of life. Both are centred around creatures that almost only the protagonist can see although while there are good/evil Yokai in Natsume Yuujinchou the Mushi of Mushishi are neither evil nor good, they are simply lifeforms and do what they have to survive. 
Both series are about demons and supernatural beings that live in this world but few can see it. 
Both shows focus on aiding with problems regarding supernatural entities. Both shows are also more atmospheric in progression 
Both are slow paced but interesting anime. 
Both involve a main character who encounters demons (or in the case of Mushishi a strange species of creature called Mushi) dealing with the supernatural while revealing the human natures and philosophical aspects of humanity through interactions with supernatural elements 
The same recurring theme, chilling soundtracks, unique plots and most of all a satisfying watch for all the mushishi fans out there. 100% recommended 
Main characters travel around encountering various supernatural occurrences and attempt to resolve them. 
Both the main characters can see things others cannot.In Natusme Yuujinchou, the people around him don't necessarily believe that what he sees are real, so this anime is has an alternate viewpoint to me. 
- Both have wise, emphatic and calm protagonists being able to interact with the supernatural world- Both share a similar art style and mood- Both don't take side with neither the humans nor the supernatural, aiming for fair balance rather- Both share a positive, compromising approach to solutions of the challenges both protagonists solveThe main differences are:- the nature of the supernatural world. Mushishi's entities are closer to natural phenomenons and animal intelligence creatures meeting ordinary humans, while Natsume deals with humanoid, sentient ghosts.- Natsume's  challenges tend to be more interpersonal and emotional level, and have more dialogue involved.- Natsume has a recurring cast spanning multiple seasons, whereas Mushishi is (except for he Doctor) a one person piece. read more 
Anthology/episodic, ayakashi, freeing troubled people/spirits, overall feel 
Both are serial anime.Both main character have special ability which is can see what most people can't (Mushi and soul).Have the similiar conflict but different object.Have a warm, sad, and miss feeling when it ends in every episode. 
natsume yuujinchou and Mishi-shi both have aspects of a chariter who can see supernatural things that very few people can see or understand. also both animes have a relaxing sence to it, no realy big bad guy and each protagonist takes life as it comes. "
457,486,60,"These are both episodic anime that center around someone who travels from town to town and  they usually wind up helping someone through a difficult situation at each stop.  While Kino's purpose is only to travel and to see different countries, Ginko's is to find and research ""Mushi.""  Both stories have beautiful animation and offer up ""life lessons.""  Although these lessons may be a little easier to see in Kino's Journey, they're there in Mushishi, as well.  Enjoy ^_^ 
One story per episode, with each episode not having much action in but still has something special about them. 
Both of these shows focus on a traveler and the people they meet along the way. In Kino's case, she's simply a traveler with no set destination. For Ginko in Mushishi, he goes around to many different places and helps those who have been effected by 'mushi', which is also his job. They also both share the same thinking-based mature atmosphere as well, sometimes even delving deep into the way the mind works and peoples own effects on the things around them. These two rather slow, yet extremely interesting, shows are very alike and if you liked one of them you should definitely check out the other. read more 
Both animes are very philosophical. Both tell the stories of two travelers, what pushed them to travel and what happens during their journey.With each episode being an incident from their journey. 
both are very philosophical and, for the most part, bloodless. . .two highly entertaining series that are great to watch when you want to wind down for the day. . . 
Both tell the life of a traveller who don't stay for very long on the same place.Mushishi tends to the supernatural genre while Kino no tabi is just a fantasy genre. The main thing they have in common is that both have really deep stories and don't tend to the comedic spot. 
I see so many similarities, I don't know where to begin. Both Ginko and Kino are force to give up there past lives due to something happening in their early childhood, and thus travel around the world. While Kino learns about the cultures of different places in her travels, Ginko's journey is more of one to help others affected by the mushi. Either way, both have episodal storylines. Though frankly I found myself enjoying Kino's journey more, there's no way one wouldn't enjoy both in the same way. 
Bothe animes have a separate story for each episode. Both are very deep, and focus on making the audience think. Both are quite good. 
Story per episode, not much action, both about forced journey which was started because of some accident, similar beautiful animations, both almost bloodless. If you love one of them you'll love another one for sure. 
Both series are episodic, and tied together by the travels of their protagonists.  Still, they both hold together very well and have solid pacing.  The two anime also frequently have a mythological or philosophical vibe to their stories.  The main difference is that Kino has a more surreal kind of setting, while Mushishi's is more traditionally Japanese. 
Episodic, sometimes philosophical about life 
Episodic series about a perpetually travelling protagonist who moves from one locale to another and becomes involved with its denizens on a regular basis. They both have a fairly laidback pace, and the rather stoic yet softhearted nature of both protagonists begs further comparison. Although Kino focuses more on the travelling and Kino herself while Mushishi brings more attention to the mushi and patients being treated, the similarities are very hard to miss. 
Both laid back atmosphere until you get to near end of each episode leaving you to think. Both protagonists are travelers who left their formal selves as their price to where they are currently. 
Episodic anime, very cerebral, not much action but very, very entertaining. It's philosophical, poignant, and beautiful. One of the best shows I have ever watched. 
Both have a very calming feel to it and short one episode story lines and both involve traveling to different countries, but don't let that deceive you, each episode is filled with an amazing story and is concluded with an unexpected/philosophical twist that is bound to amaze you. Also the main characters are very similar in their passiveness(or sense of indifference) as well as their inability to settle down in one place. 
Both are episodic series involving a traveling protagonist that helps out the people that they come across. They both also have a very similar feeling and style to the other. 
Episodic nature with a detached main character, that functions more as a narrator or plot device, than a protagonist. 
Let me start off by saying that these two are both very excellent series in my opinion.  Kino's Journey and Mushi-shi possess a certain quality that draws you into their own world.  Kino's Journey gives the feel of being in a slightly dark fairytale, whereas Mushi-shi draws you into what seems like a world of mythology and folklore.  I strongly recommend either of these series to anyone who is interested in a story book feel to their anime. 
They both have a similar vibe of unsteady peace and they both follow the lives of people who travel far. They both focus on the observation of aspects of life (Kino's journey is more moral and mental while Mushishi is more physical and natural)They are also both very earie and inspirational. Highly suggested! 
The step up of the both animes are similar, each episode (or short arc) is it's own story and one does not need to watch them in any particular order to understand them (though I think that is the better course). The reason this is possible is because both main characters are travelers who do not take on any new companions for the duration of both series. Their histories are a mystery and little bits of both are revealed slowly in certain episodes. In addition I feel both have interesting and unique little stories for each episode that seem to have a deeper meaning and come off quite philosophic, though you don't really need to think this way in order to enjoy them. If you liked the idea, plot, characters, stories, or everything about one of these animes I am fairly sure you will love the other. read more 
Both anime's stories are episodic with each story arc usually contained to just one episode. In each anime the main character travels around to various towns and cities to observe what's going on and usually lending a helping hand to the residents. 
Both have a stand alone episode plot structure. Both have protagonists who have very good reasons for traveling. And both acquire memorable experiences wherever they go.Kino is more apethetic and distant. Ginko helps any and every. 
Both are slow-paced and profound series, with own separate story in each episode. The protagonists are also very similiar: they are not good or bad, they are just observers. 
These two anime are resembling because of putting more attention to philosophical ideas than to bright actions. 
Both shows are about travelers who go ttown to town meeting new people and solving problems or getting a new meaning in life. 
Theme of the journey, whereby the MC travels from place to place and helps people along the way; episodic; minimal background music/sounds; monotonous, expressionless MC; beautiful art (more so in Mushishi) and beautiful music (more so in Kino); general quiet, serene, & sleepy atmosphere.The only difference is Kino is more philosophical, explores the human condition, and is full of life lessons, whereas Mushishi is supernatural, explores the paranormal, and is full of mindfreaks. 
The same idea of a non-ending journey, a world and rythm like poetry. 
traveler, very unique towns, no antagonist. Mushishi and Kino no Tabi somehow taught me a side of human nature that seemingly indescribable. 
They're both episodic anime that center around someone who travels from town to town and they usually wind up helping someone through situations at each stop.  Both stories have beautiful animation and offer up ""life lessons.""  
Both animes are slow paced and thought-provoking, episodical in structure and green in look and feel, still, with some drastic shots here and there. Maybe Mushishi is more 'supernatural' whereas Kino no Tabi gets more comical. Both travelling protagonists seem to be fine with solitude, yet accompanied all the time. 
Very sad but beautiful stories that are episodic (meaning you don't have to watch in order) and the main characters are calm and level-headed.  
Both are about a journey, leading to a path of greater enlightenment. Whether it's understanding the meaning of life or just understanding oneself a little better, both tackle philosophical problems of existence and morality while trying to grasp our own place in the world. 
Both anime are about a person who travels the world. Mushishi focuses more on beautiful storytelling, whilst Kino no Tabi is more about philosophical hypothesis. 
Shows that focus their character development on a solitary wanderer instead of a full cast. The stories the wanderer encounters, however, tell us a great deal about human nature and some very interesting reflections. 
Travelling the world on your own. Exploring new locations and meeting new people (and creatures). If this sounds appealing, then these are the shows for you. They both feature solo protagonists who are travelling the world. Each encounter and location is unique and wonderful to discover, and following these journeys makes you feel as though you are truly there. These are the two best travel anime, in my opinion. If you've seen one and not the other, you will surely enjoy it. They give off similar peaceful yet eerie vibes, as most stories have multiple sides and moralities to them. There's often no correct answer, only to let nature run it's course. read more 
It is not close but this is the closest i can get.Both anime series seems to have a lesson behind every episode. 
Both are beautifully serene and go along at a soft pace. In each, though the episodes may follow an overarching theme and central characters, they are individual stories rather than part of one continuous plot-line. 
In Kino no Tabi we have a calm composed protagonist that travels the world seeing many strange and wonderful things. No matter what her feelings on a matter might be Kino never gets more involved than she has to and refuses to settle down, always traveling.Mushishi has the same sort of formula with the composed traveler protagonist. However, Ginko cannot settle down due to extrenuating circumstances, also Ginko travels as an expert on a subject and therefor keeps a proffesional distance from his subjects.The real reason someone who enjoyed Kino no Tabi would enjoy Mushishi is that you somehow experience these two shows in the same way, they both have that certain something that keeps you locked in. Also the animation is beautiful and the places interesting. read more 
Both have the main character traveling across lands with unique short stories that are highly philosophical.  
Both series are episodic and are at their core masterful examinations of culture, philosophy & human spirit. Though they have their noticeable and sometimes profound differences, where Mushi-shi has a far more supernatural sentiment that is a reflection of a cultural spiritual identity, and Kino's Journey has a far more down-to-earth approach enlightening an observation of humanities faults and attributing a very real embodiment of human nature. 
Both these marvels take the wanderer/adventure/traveler concepts to a new level. Both are modern classics but with an age-old pacing and ambiance. They showcase why this genre is the most expansive and adept at wholly encompassing all aspects of human nature. These gems are the closest I've ever come to a religious experience, they just reek of mysticism and divinity in the best possible way. 
Both are execelentes Oran series that make you think about life. 
Both of these give off the same feeling,make every episode a new story, and are part of one big adventure. Most likely, you would like one if you like the other. 
I think the ""flow"" of both anime is very similiar, slow plot with a traveler traveling finding new things 
Both shows have a similar feeling and are existential. They explore human nature and philosophical aspects of life, death, and living in general. Great life lessons can be scooped from both shows. 
Episodic tale of lone (kinda) protagonist seemingly aimlessly travelling through world and interacting with lifes of others. Both works have extremelly well crafted storytelling and even minor characters are well developed, making every story as the protagonist encounters them interesting.  
These episodic shows follow travelers and tell the stories of their encounters. Some of the tales told are remarkably similar as well: the origin of a name, the mountain's fire. The characters embody the mindset of a traveler: do not disrupt the flow. 
Mushishi and Kino no Tabi are very similar to each other in many ways. The two series protagonists, at the very least, lead similar lives. Both are travelers. Both are detached, unbiased, and unprejudiced. Both also seem content to observe their world rather than preach to it. More broadly, both series use episodic plots to tell fables that are both thought provoking and emotionally resonant. 
Similarities:- rather episodic nature with minimal backround story development- great sense of adventure and mystery of the world- atmospheric- rather stoic, capable main characterDifferences:- In Mushishi the MC is there to help the people while Kino is more of an observer and rarely intervenes- Mushishi's short stories feature character interaction with great detail while Kino no Tabi is rather minimalistic and puts its focus on showing the system- Kino no Tabi is arguably darker and mostly shows the ugly sides of humanity while Mushishi has more of a mix 
The 3 best words to describe both of these shows? Episodic, dark and calming. Both main characters seem devoid of emotion, have interesting (and dark) backgrounds and travel from town to town learning about their chosen field. Whilst Kino travels to learn about the world ( ignoring the problems she faces) Ginko learns about Mushi, an invisible (to most) lifeform (similar to that of insects) solving the problems they cause people who dont know of their existence. Mushishi is extremely dark and most episodes can leave you feeling bittersweet or on the verge of tears. If you enjoy The Beautiful World, you will no doubt adore Mushishi as well. read more 
Vast world, main character doesn't stay at one place too long, calm toned, similar animation quality, episodic. 
both are adventure themedboth are episodic seriesboth are very philosophical both have very main characters who have an uncaring attitude towards life 
The main character of both anime is a travelor. In the case of Kino no Tabi, Kino visits different countries and gets to know people's way of living. Mushishi shows how Ginko discovers the life of Mushi. One difference is that Kino doesn't interfere in the people's lives while Ginko always helps those who are affected by a Mushi. In Kino no Tabi you get to see a few short fights which is not the case in Mushishi. 
Two lone travelers exploring beautiful fantasy worlds and encountering unique characters along their journey. Both anime give a calm vibe but at the same time, there's always a dark side or dark theme involved.Every Mushi-related issue solved by Ginko or city visited by Kino have a fairy tale feel.The protagonist in each anime also share a mysterious aura, are generally very calm or 'cool', and have a background and motivation to go on a journey.The supportive characters in both anime are also very likable and charismatic. 
They are both episodic TV shows, which are depressing + there is a guy wandering around the world. Kino's on his journey and Ginko is looking for and dealing with Mushi.  
These shows see the world through the eyes of the traveler, giving an objective commentary to the worlds they visit. Each episode is a self contained narrative and their respective protagonists have mysterious back stories. 
Not a discovery, but it is always good to remind how close Mushishi is to Kino no Tabi. Both series are episodic and have a different story in every chapter. Kino and Ginko are pretty similar: cold-minded, warm-hearted characters that are not good or bad, just ""they"", and in the end the philosophy is somehow the same: everywhere you go you'll find something new and different.I recommend that if you liked one, you should watch the other, because for me, being a Kino fan, I am enjoying Mushishi. 
Mushishi and Kino no Tabi are episodic and follow one or two charcters respectively for the anime's entirety.  The main similiarity is that both shows excel at developing their calm but interesting atmospheres, which improves them both greatly. 
These two anime are both episodic and have similar pacing. As much as I love mushishi I believe Kino's Journey has more to offer. Kino's Journey touches on many topics Mushishi doesn't such as human ideology, culture, and much more in just 12 episodes. Kino is also an amazing character with phenomenal writing. All and all if you enjoyed Mushishi I believe you would enjoy Kino's Journey just as much if not more.  
I found it hard to find some as calm yet dynamic as Mushi-shi, but Kino no Tabi gave me that similar feeling. In both shows the only thing they ties each other all together is the main character, Ginko or Kino. Kino no Tabi replicates the feeling that Mushi-shi gave- a world outside the main character. Both have beautiful animation and episode to episode plots. I still prefer Mushi-shi, but Kino is still an amazing show that is worth checking out. "
457,2246,42,"The story lines are pretty similar. They both feature a male lead that travels in search of supernatural events and spirits, etc. And both are episodic type animes.  
The premises of both involve their respective main characters (usually mistaken as being mere medicine men due to their appearances) traveling around period piece Japan and solving supernatural problems. But Mononoke lacks Mushishi's depth since, where as the Mushi in Mushishi are an extension of nature that aren't inherently good or bad (nature can be cruel, folks!), the titular Mononoke are vengeful spirits that need to be put to rest. Both series follow a pattern of gaining understanding before the problems can be resolved, but Mononoke's stories nearly all being related to vengeance left much more restricted and limited: always having a murder mystery 'whodunnit?' approach. Also, Mononoke's nameless lead was never explained, and never will be since there's no source material. On the other hand, Mushishi's lead, Ginko, has a full back-story. In a nutshell, the premises are very similar but what separates the two is that Mononoke is very much style over substance, where as Mushishi is substance over style. read more 
Both stories involed a man wandering around japan carrying around a wooden box and deals with supernatural entities and helps people along the way. Mononoke is a lot darker and a bit more cynical then Mushishi is, and the Medicine Seller is more of an anti hero, but that doesn't keep him from being an enjoyable, interesting character. The stories in both series are interesting, each being self contained, though Monoke tells it's stories in a series of 5 arcs. Also, Mononoke's stories are always more on the horror side of things, whereas Mushishi's are usually more emotional. 
Both look amazing, while Mononokes art is more abstract is still manages to immerse the viewer.Both have a medicine seller who traverses from place to place attempting to solve paranormal situations. 
Both deal with the supernatural and both have charismatic lead characters. The drawings in Mononoke will take a little getting used to. Just a little warning, some parts of Mononoke can be quite scary compared to Mushishi.  
Anime with Unique art? Relating to a search of mystic beings of some sorts? You got it in these both. Although both do have their differences, if you loved one, you'll love the other. As a bonus, both protagonists are lovable (in a hot, respectable way).  
Both series concern a main character who travels around solving supernatural problems. The Medicine Seller has his mononoke, and Ginko has his mushi. 
Both series have a travelling protagonist who helps different people in each episode or story arc with supernatural creatures they don't understand -- traditional Japanese spirits in Mononoke, and unusual nature spirits in Mushishi. 
If you liked the story about a man wandering around from place to place, ""saving"" people from supernatural creatures, then Mononoke is for you. But Mononoke has bizarre scenes, really artistic detalis, and also...it's a dark version of Mushishi.  
Episodic and is similar in the fact that the protagonist is a traveller and medicine seller eliminating supernatural creatures. In Mushishi it was Mushis and in Mononke it is the poor mononokes being terminated. Both are amazing shows. 
Both series features a traveling mysterious main character that deals with supernatural phenomena around. While melancholy and drama are foremost for Mushishi and mystery for Mononoke they still have a similar mood. Their artwork have different stylings, but the approach of evershifting reality and simplicity is close. 
Both have a main character dealing with weird supernatural happenings.  
Both series have a travelling main character who specialises in dealing with paranormal beings, they also both have amazing art, though mononoke is more abstract. 
Both series deal with the supernatural and follow the journeys of a fascinating lead character. There is no over-arching plotline, but a succession of situations involving strange creatures and humans. Each has an original and distinct atmosphere with great art, animation and soundtrack. 
You could swap the plot summaries for each of these shows and it would still make sense. They are about a travelling man wandering from place to place solving problems related to supernatural entities. Mononoke focuses more on the horror aspect of these entities, Mushishi focuses more on the surreal and enchanting, and both are excellent at what they do. The main characters also share a lot of similarities, though Ginko is much more relatable to the viewer, as we do get glimpses into his past. 
Both Mushishi and Mononoke are about traveling ""magicians"" who help solve peoples' problems. Both stories take place during an Edo-like period and have beautiful character designs. Mononoke has longer story arcs while Mushishi has a one-shot episode format. Ginko (Mushishi) is more personable while Kusuriuri (Mononoke) is more ethereal.   
Main heroes of both anime are travelling soul healers. Esotheric, psychedelic, psychological, simple but deep meaning, cleanse yourself, find your zen. 
Both anime are episodic, has a wandering medicine seller main character. One is chasing after rumours about mononoke and the other is chasing about mushi rumours.Each of the main characters is helping people with their skills and knowledge.Mononoke is harder to understand, even with a well understanding of japanese culture and history. Each detail in Mononoke has an explanation.Both anime are interesting to watch. If you like one of these, you might like the other. 
The similarity is that both Ginkgo and Kusuriuri use their knowledge to help when it comes to the spiritual world and the problems that may occur whit contact between the human and mysterious. Besides that, inner fulfillment exists when watching both anime. 
Mononoke is kinda like a much more sinister version of Mushishi.  Both feature an enigmatic medicine seller (although Ginko is more developed) roaming the land ""exorcising"" mysterious spirits.  Mononoke is more of an atmospheric pseudo-horror anime though, and the art is much more stylized (and absolutely jaw-dropping it is). 
Both have a very similar feel to themboth are episodicBoth Leads go around running into supernatural events both have white hair XD Both have a an eerie atmosphereBoth leads ""help"" or give advice about different phenomenons to people on their travels 
Exactly the same story, but Mononoke is more psychological and horror-infused, while Mushishi is more philosophical and peaceful. Mushishi's world is somewhat more grounded, while Mononoke is heavily centered around Japanese mythology. The simplest way I can put it is that Mononoke is Mushishi's dark, edgier brother - Don't take that as an insult though; Both shows are mature, beautiful looking, and thought-provoking, and can even deliver strong emotional punches. 
It can't be said enough, but anyone who liked one show will like the others. Ginko and the Medicine Peddler may have starkly different methods, outlooks on life, and motivations, there is something that ties the two shows together.  
Mysterious wandering protagonists with a suitcase of curios travelling and interacting with the world's more unearthly inhabitants.Very different art styles, but with a similar atmosphere humming quietly with curiosity, showing the subtle enjoyment found in travelling and learning. Not as serious as people make them out to be, there is plenty of humour and silliness, just not as loud as in other shows. 
I could talk about episodic construction these titles which improves impression that they touch the most basic themes human's lives. Or maybe I could tell you about the protagonists who always give the victim a hand but provided that this person wants his help and change the status quo. I could talk... but it is not really important. They are so specific that not everybody will be satisfied after them. But they are worth trying. 
A wandering salesman often traveling in rural country is usually tasked with combating supernatural enemies or hindrances. Both main characters have an easy going nature and tend to be highly respected individuals when people figure out who they are.  
In both animes, the main character travels around the world: finding answers about rumours related to mushis in Mushishi's case and related to demons in Mononoke's case.Both are composed by short stories well structured. 
both series are episodic with a mysterious main character and have supernatural elementes.  
Luminous paths. Bewitching Sceneries. What can travellers see else?Ginko and Kusuriuri are similar to personality, profession, purpose. They traveling various places, and there are all sorts of drama.Sometimes fortunate. Sometimes melancholy. Nobody knows what will happen to their life.Mushishi is style of calm. Profound story draw in you. That's beautiful suggestiveness.Contrastingly, Mononoke is very fright, eerie. You can see Kusuriuri's coolness that unleash sword of exterminating evil.Both plot is almost episodic. As stated previously, travellers go many new lands. Each episode content is quite deep.Art and Soundtrack also great. Both are beauty, remaining easy to impression.If you liked Mushishi or Ginko, you definitely like Mononoke and Kusuriuri.Well, if possible, I have Mushishi's sequels to watch you. More energetic. read more 
Mononoke and Mushishi are quite similar, despite the difference in art styles and general 'vibe'. The two main characters share a similar... occupation if you will. They both spend their days travelling in search of Mushi, or Mononoke. Both stories are interesting, however unlike Mushishi, Mononoke doesn't go episode by episode. The arcs take 2-3 episodes, however each arc is still interesting. Mononoke also contains a catch, unlike Mushishi where Ginko can easily solve an issue in a single episode. 
Both revolve around mysterious travelers traveling around with their big back bags they both travel around to exorcise creatures that affects a place or a human in an unnatural way 
The main characters are both wanderers and travel around the country to solve the problems caused by supernatural beings. I lack the words to properly describe the genre, so I'll label them both as ""food-for-thought-anime"". If you like short stories with a deeper meaning, then Mushishi / Mononoke (depending on which one you haven't watched yet) is definitely worth (binge) watching. 
I wonder why I forgot to create this recommendation as it is so obvious.Mononoke and Mushishi certainly appeal to the same audience. If you are looking for unique exorcism anime look no further. If you enjoyed one of these, you will certainly enjoy the other as they even share a similar mini-arc episodic story (Mononoke arcs are longer though). Even both protagonists work as lone medicine sellers that deal with demons for a living.Smart 'demons' designs that are more of phenomena than evil creatures, a very mysterious protagonist and incredible and unique visuals mark some of the similarities.Both certainly have this ""creepy"" and eerie aura in some scenes as well. read more 
While both of these shows share an episodic format and a similar ""plot"", they have a different form of entertaining viewers. In Mushishi, the MC isn't always fully involved with the incidents shown and in some episodes he doesn't even appear until the last few minutes. In Mononoke, you're with the MC from start to finish; he's always involved with the supernatural incidents.When you watch Mushishi, you enjoy the stories it brings; when you watch Mononoke, you enjoy not only the stories presented, but also the mysterious and enigmatic MC. 
Both shows have the main character traveling to different places helping people who have issues with the supernatural. 
- both shows follow a traveler who is fighting against supernatural creatures- supernatural elements in both shows are highly influenced by Japanese mythology and beliefs- MCs of both shows are pretty quiet and they are only interested in their jobs- both shows are made up of stories that are not connected to each other 
they both solve problem for other people, give kinda the siimilar vibe but mushishi is more to the relax, quite side. and mononoke is more into cult thing and have some action and disturbing image one or two 
Both feature supernatural creatures in which both main characters travel around to either exterminate or get rid of in the manner of healing. Both of these shows are episodic and don't really require a certain watch order. Additionally, both main characters are cryptic and much isn't known about either of them. Their moral values, previous life experiences, etc. are not really known. Essentially a very similar show except that Mononoke is far more abstract and artistic. 
The show follows a protagonist that is minor to the story. The show is not about the protagonist himself, but the monsters that they encounter and their stories. 
Both are episodic, and have beautiful stories. The art is great for both of them, though in completely different styles--Mushishi is tranquil and peaceful, while Mononoke is eerie and haunting. But both feautre a mysterious traveller who visits households and people to offer aid from supernatural things that is not so easily understandable or remedied, and for both, the travellers are not the protagonists of the episodes, they are the catalysts through which we get to know the stories.  
The main selling point of both shows is that it mesmerizes its viewers by telling daunting, unsettling, and beautifully absorbing stories incorporated into an episodic-type anime. 
A mysterious being wanders Japan, seeking out otherworldly creatures and saving people from their ignorance through a combination of skill, technique and wit.  "
457,164,15,"They pretty much share the same mentality regarding nature and spiritual life, both being influenced by the supernatural. The overall atmosphere is also the same with incredible scenery and hauntingly beautiful music. The most simple things turn out to be miracles of life.  
Both anime revolve around the spiritual aspect of nature and are rooted in Shinto beliefs.  
Both deal with the supernatural and the relationships between humans and the world they inhabit. 
Both are situated in an old Japanese era.Both main characters looking after the spirits of nature. 
Both are themed on plant, forest, animal, supernatural! 
Both cover the spiritual world of old Japan, and watching Mushishi helps western people understand Princess Mononoke better. 
A beautiful anime about relationship between human being and nature. 
Mushishi and Mononoke Hime explore nature in a fantasy setting.With their themes, both anime adapt a mystical background with ingredients of a tale involving characters that get themselves involved with supernatural beings. They also present a powerful background with a natural outlook of its nature.The soundtracks are smooth ones that retain a serene-like feeling with minimal comedy. Character relationships are explored and the laws of nature with humans and beasts are also emphasized. 
Both are filled with serene backgrounds and music and stress the theme of mankind's balance with nature and the spiritual aspects it possesses.  
they both possess something soft and mature about them. supernatural, fantasy, and adventure. they have a very smooth transgression, get you thinking, and have a bittersweet feel to them. 
Both share themes of nature, humanity, and the cycle of birth and death. Mononoke Hime has spirits of the forest, gods, demons... These are very similar to the mushi of Mushishi, with the main character of Mushishi also trying to find a balance between humans and nature, the same way Askitaka does. Both have gorgeous scenery and animation, with heavy emphasis on natural surroundings.  
The atmosphere is very similar. Both deal with nature, the supernatural, and what is the very core of all life itself.  
Both stories are about the coexistence of people and nature. Both using supernatural metaphors - spirits of nature - to tell the story. 
They both have an incredibly similar world and atmosphere. An older time in the forests of Japan where there are themes of the spirits of nature and humans living in harmony.  
Beautiful scenery and similar theme of respecting nature and humanity's place alongside it, even though nature can be dangerous and frightening. "
457,2966,9,"Both very mellow. Both have supernatural elements.Both main male characters looks similar and act the same for the most partxD 
Both shows have a similar pace and main character. Moreover, they are episodic anime about the mysteries of nature (and incarnations of nature too !). 
Both anime had the same kind of atmosphere about them. They were set in olden eras and followed the same kind of easy pace, following traveling characters. Putting that aside, I even thought that Lawrence and Ginko looked vaguely similar as well.  
Both Mushishi and Spice and Wolf are very laid back series, which is nice. They also both focus on solving things; Mushishi it's things that relate to spirits, Spice and Wolf it's related to things that involve trade and commerce. Both series have very good characters and character development as well. And finally, the pair of male leads even look like each other! 
Although the plots are very different, both male protagonists are similar. They are similar in the way they act, travel and see the world. Additionally, they both have deeper meanings built into them, but it is much more prevalent in Mushishi. Spice and Wolf focuses on the depth of person to person interactions while Mushishi explores the interaction between humans and the world around them. 
Both Mushishi and Ookami to Koushinryou are styled after traditional legends and folktales, with fantasy elements delicately intertwined with reality. There is also a sort of inexpressible atmospheric similarity to the shows; one gets the sense that they don't go out of their way to impress the viewer, they simply present their own particular reality. To cite Mushishi,""everything is only as it is."" 
Travelling protagonist visiting various locations of the land, meeting various people and engaging with them, sometimes changing their lives. Also making use of his craft to get around and as a way to sustain his livehood.  
-Both have a relaxed vibe to them.-Both revolve around a traveler/travelers who face new adventures in each location-Both have good music 
This is a genre of anime that I personally am in love with. Both of these animes are about traveling. These two anime manage to blend in fantasy with reality in such a way that will not seem far-fetched at all. Mushishi is a little more calm compared to S&W. Both animes have beautiful art. What I like most about these two animes is that they are both set in a medeval time peroid, although it's harder to see what time  peroid Mushishi is in, it's not as important as it is in Spice and Wholf. Watch both of these anime if you want to set your mind at peace and relax. I highly recommend them! read more "
457,5081,8,"Both of these animes are about people who deal with the interactions of otherworldy creatures and humans. The series are divided up into short segments. However, Bakemonogatari's short stories can last a few episodes long while each episode of Mushishi is seperate. Bakemonogatari is more eccentric with unique animations and a cast of very developed characters. Mushishi focuses more on nature and harmony and has only one main character.Bakemonogatari is recommended for more mature viewers. 
I get the same feeling when I watch these animes, it has similar mystical worlds and creatures that does make human life more difficult. The main characters always finds themselves helping those that are around them. It's really worth the time watching.  
Both involve oddities, although Monogatari is more about the characters and their role within the story, and Mushishi is more about the interesting and unique oddities that exist within its world. Mushishi is episodic however.  
In both series, the main character interacts with people attached to supernatural beings. 
Bakemonogatari and Mushishi have quite a few similarities.First of all the Main Characters Araragi and Ginko have a lot in common. They are trying to help other people with their problems and oddities.The show is not about the Main Characters themselves, as you do not learn a lot about their own past and story, but more about the people around them.Both shows have a mystery/supernatural side.The biggest difference between the shows is how they are presented.Mushishi is really serious and give you an experience that not a lot of shows will give you. Bakamonogatari has a fun side and it has a completely different artstyle. 
Both series talk about a main character using supernatural powers to save other people from their supernatural problems.Both anime have a dark eerie atmosphere, intriguing mystery with a historical theme.Bakemonogatari being in a high school setting, also has humour, romance and some fanservice.While Mushishi is about a lone man on the road which makes it more on the Adventure side.The art is beautiful and the voice acting is on point 
Both shows explore vague paranormal phenomenons, dealing with the most terrifying abominations possible. Both shows have a really unique creepy atmosphere, and are somewhat relaxing to watch. 
Like Mushishi, Bakemonogatari focuses on people's problems with supernatural beings i.e spirits, demons etc. In Bakemonogatari these problems get solved in similar fashion like in Mushishi by some kind of ritual or by understanding the problem to its roots.  "
457,10408,6,"Both focused on the person, who  can't live side by side with people because of circumstances. Both cause a calm and sadness 
Slow pace anime with magic creatures and epic story  
They both deal with spirits and have such a nostalgic sense to them. 
Well, they're not exactly the same thing but these two anime have a lot in common imo.Mushishi and Hotarubi no Mori e gives off a serene like feeling that is natural. Both series has supernatural themes with the main character being calm and collected. There is of course, strange rules in this world and applies it throughout both series. Both are wonderfully presented that has spiritual feeling to them which makes them relaxing to watch. 
-lonely white haired free-spirit-having fun outside in beautiful nature scenery-isolated villages with traditional air-returning over and over to visit-spirits and supernatural-accepting facts as facts 
The art of these two shows and the main male protagonist are similar. The beautiful landscapes of both Mushishi and Hotarubi are breathtaking and very similar. The art design for the characters is also quite similar. Not only do Ginko and Gin look alike, they also have a very similar purpose in their respective plots and act/think in similar ways. There is also a very similar kind of nostalgic tone to both shows. Additionally, both have meaning under the literal and will leave you thinking.  "
457,199,5,"Both are fantasy Anime that are really imaginative and filled with fantasy. Both Anime feature strange creatures in a world that is similar to ours. 
They both have to do with spirits, and both are colorful and unique. 
1. It has the same innocent child-like feel to it.2. Filled with strange creatures. 3. The ability to see spirits.  
Both of them have a slow plot and maybe will make you bored if you don't like a soft anime.but if you like soft and SOL anime, this anime will make you washed away when you watch. The conflict between Human and Nature, then the fantasy with supernatural  are the most interested point and making you comfortable to watching 
Each of these anime follow the story of a character who journeys through a morally ambiguous world of diverse creatures that co-exist. "
457,13125,5,"This may seem like an odd recommendation at first glance, but it's not completely without reason - both invite contemplation on moral issues, the characters, and the mystical world they're set in without making any judgment, welcoming the viewer to either make their own or simply accede that there is no clear right or wrong. Shinsekai Yori is much more dramatic and epic, presenting a world that is dystopic; Mushishi is subdued and calming, presenting a world that is filled with muted wonder, if at times melancholic. 
Something about the eerie, mysterious settings remind me of each other. The Mushishi episodes are not really connected in a linear manner as Shinsekai yori is. Both have protagonists with a special power trying to figure out mysterious phenomena. 
Both shows are incredibly atmospheric. The sceneries are beautiful and calming. Both are capable of drawing you into the story with visuals alone. While the plots of the shows are completely different, both have a calming feeling to them. Best watched at night. 
Monsters and supernatural creatures are also present in Mushishi, besides belonging to the genre seinen both animes are very good stories and should be valued. 
Shinsekai yori is like an episode of Mushishi without a Ginko character and expanded to fill a full series. The characters in Shinsekai yori have to deal with a mysterious dangerous world they don't understand. The themes and atmosphere are similar between the two shows. What's different is that Shinsekai Yori has one dramatic story it wants to tell and it lacks the sense of adventure or discovery that Mushishi has. "
457,205,4,"If you like ""slow"" anime, easy ones. I think you will love it. 
Similar historical setting, visual style and episodic structure. Although they are of different genres, if you like Mushishi, you will most likely enjoy Samurai Champloo and vice versa. 
Despite being fundamentally different shows on both premise and theme, Mushishi and Samurai Champloo share a lot of superficial and aesthetic similarities: both take place in Japan, and have heavy Japanese settings and culture, and both were produced around the mid-2000's, which, combined with their similar settings leads to similar visuals and aesthetics. While Mushishi exudes tranquility and nature from its setting and soundtrack, Samurai Champloo exudes brazenness, youth, and action scenes, so both are diametrically different thematically, but if you enjoyed Mushishi for its Japanese themes and setting, then you'll likely also enjoy Samurai Champloo. 
While the writing and characters are pretty different, the atmosphere and settings are very similar. Set in a quasi-realistic version of feudal Japan, introspection and contemplating self-worth play big parts in the themes of both shows and the voice acting is phenomenal in either. Animation is quality, each episode stands alone as it's own self-contained story that doesn't need much prior explaining or setup. All the motion of people/creatures either feels extremely realistic or unsettlingly surreal and scary, the animators cared about the quality of the show. Mushishi does have some differences, it's a bit more fantastical and metaphorical, not everything shown is what is actually happening but no matter what episode you put on, you'll be entertained.  read more "

Both can see things you shouldn't see, but natsume is lighter 
Helping others expecting nothing in return is what Mushishi and Natsume's Book of Friends is all about. In Mushishi, coexisting with creatures is important to have a mutual understanding. In Natsume's Book of Friends, the message of acceptance and friendship between the uncanny and the living is addressed. If you love the tranquility of Natsume's Book of Friends, you will probably like Mushishi "
457,10162,3,"Similar simple art and animation, action progression is equally slow.There is no useless moves, actions, scenes. In both anime reactions of charachters are believable and it simply gives us similar feeling of well spent time after watching anime where there is actually almost nothing to complain about.  
Both are calm but with some spicy comedy anime. In Mushishi however, that comedy is weaker. It's more of a serious anime. 
Usagi Drop is about a thirty year old man named Daichi who goes to his grandfather's funeral, and learns that his grandfather had an illegitimate child named Rin, who's 5/6 years old. Due to the scandal Rin's existence would cause, none of the relatives want to take her in. Daichi, the kind-hearted soul that he is, agrees to take in Rin, much to his entire family's dismay, believing he'd be an incompetent parent and taking her in would bring shame upon the family. He does struggle with raising Rin, but he's up to the task of growing as a parental figure. Mushishi is about a nomadic traveller named Ginko. Ginko is a mushi master. Mushi are (mostly invisible) life forms that can be very harmful to humans or the land/object/host it occupies. Ginko travels, helping people who are affected by mushishi- a healer/exorcist, for lack of better terms. These shows have very different plots, but they're both slice of life with a slow but calming pace. Both talk about growing as a person, and finding their place in the world.  read more "
457,5300,2,"While the first season of Natsume Yuujinchou was already compared often to Mushishi, Natsume Yuujinchou was always a lot more gentler and less that's-the-way-life-is than Mushishi. Zoku Natsume Yuujinchou for the most part is just like the first series, but it's a tad bit darker and closer to Mushishi, with its theme being confronting with reality and making a choice rather than the changing of the main character of the first season. Otherwise, watch both series for the reasons stated by others for natsume Yuujichou. 
(Zoku) Natsume Yuujincho and Mushishi both share that gentle pacing, along with being for the most part episodic (in a positive way), and a similar main character (though Ginko would be a 10 years older and more mature Natsume, if that's even possible). While Natsume Yuujincho deals with ayakashi and Mushishi with a most basic type of lifeform called mushi, you will likely find something in both that will tug at your heartstrings. "

457,10379,2,"Both main characters can see weird creatures, same mystery, and similar plots. Each episode new story new characters.  
Mushishi is very similar in the theme of Natsume Yuujinchou San with creatures that cant be seen by all. There is  similar feeling in the stories natsume and ginko participate.. The deference between them in my opinion is that Natsume Yuujinchou San can appeal to younger fans since it is more relatable since it involves school and has a more goofy feeling to it.. On the other hand Mushishi feels more mature with its lack of comedy. Also Ginko is like a wandering doctor for the supernatural.(It doesnt sound cool i know but cool is not its selling point) "
457,1,2,"Both are mostly episodic with a subplot forming very passively through the series. But the reason you will like both is that they have the same type of viewing experience. The nice soundtrack in Cowboy Bebop and the beautiful artwork in Mushishi really make for a lovely viewing experience. There is also the same serene mood in both series (although both can be quite exciting at times). 
The people who dislike either mushishi or Cowboy bebop ussually think they're too slow or episodic. Both have vignettes that raise questions you can think about. Both are very athmospheric and have a certain vibe created by amazing art and animation and a great soundtrack.  "
38329,9253,7,"Both Shows deal with Time Travel and Despair. One is a movie and one is a series thereby the latter making it longer to reveal the secrets behind time travel. A story about second chances.

Plot is related to time and there is romance involved in both. 
-Both of them share a similar back-drop - Going to different timelines to change or alter the protagonist's relative present-Some scenes will leave you in denial, which is a good thing when watching a show of this sort-If you enjoyed the premise of either, you'll enjoy the other show too :) 
If you like time travel and sci-fi, then you would also find Steins;Gate enjoyableBoth anime contains time traveling in order to achieve goals. In Bunny Girl Senpai, it is more focused on romance, but if you're more interested in sci-fi, technologies, and something more intense, more emotional, you should DEFINITELY watch Steins;Gate. 
It has a very similar plot line with a main character having to use time travel to save the people he cares about. Similar themes of grief and dealing with loss are touched on. Keep in mind this is a sequel and requires watching the original series. 
Without spoiling steins gate, both shows have a main character while fully being aware of the weird things that have been happening around them, they both have a female figure that supports them throughout the series, and especially in the movie they both delve into the theme of time travel o alter a tragic future... "

Let's get one thing straight The Disappearance is a masterpiece, no anime sequel film has ever or likely will ever touch the level of quality that it delivers. However, I get why people compare these two, they do have a similar tone, similar characters. If you want something like The Disappearance, you could do worse than this one.  
if you're a spinoff movie for a popular science fiction/slice of life/dramedy anime series about emotional high schoolers dealing with supernatural events and your plot relies heavily on time travel paradoxes raise your hand  
First off, both movies/series are a must watch. If you haven't seen one of these add them to your watch list immediately. (bunny senpai movie is available to watch outside of cinemas as of a few weeks ago)the Suzumiya movie is widely regarded as a masterpiece and struck the attention of many anime fans when it was released. The fan base were largely skeptical about the previous season but were blown away by how well crafted the movie turned out. Bunny girl senpai gives off a very similar vibe, it's quiet, understated and slow-building but goes from 1-100 very quick. The movie struck me in the same way Suzumiya did all those years ago. Trust me, if you've been putting either of these shows off or haven't yet watched the movies you should go do it right now. read more 
Both Anime have a very similar, dark tone and atmosphere. The plot is also suprisingly similar to the point where a complete coincidence is hard to believe, having the Main Character try to save the ones he loves alone without any idea how to. And even if I think Haruhi Suzumiya is far better at almost every level, everyone should check out both movies if they are interested.

- Similar style.- Almost same genres.- Both movies are very emotional. 
Similar story progression. Remember what made Kimi no Na wa interesting when you watched it. An above-average anime that evolves into a masterpiece, right?

431,199,25," Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle are visually stunning experiences with a strong surreal underpinning behind coming of age narratives. In both movies a magical world unfolds before bewildered young heroines who must claim a new position within apparent chaos. Spirited Away is more hectic and upbeat while Howl's focus on darker themes such as war and violence. Yet both invoke the same spirit of beautiful natural scenes rendered sublime by Miyazaki's unique style.  
A mystical and enchanted storyline of romance permeates both of these wonderful creations by the same director 
This two great movies have the same creator and they both contain great stories about curse, love, and drama at the same time. If you'll notice upon watching them, the way they were drawn was also the same. In characters Haku(Spirited away) and Howl(HMC) do look alike. Both movies have great lessons and that after you watch them they will surely leave a good memory. 
As you all likely know already, both Howl's Moving Castle and Spirited Away are the brainchild of Hayao Miyazaki; however, the two films share numerous similarities in addition to Studio Ghibli and Miyazaki's style.Perhaps the greatest overbearing theme in both movies is the use of surreality bordering upon absurdism. Miyazaki is a master of this style. His movies are filled with surreal and inventive worlds and magical, unique characters. More so than any of his other films, Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle invoke the same feeling of wonder to their majestic settings.As far as the narrative goes, both movies are centered two young and bewildered coming of age heroins and their sojourns through the new and fantastic worlds they are discovering. Along the way, love, compassion, curiosity and development are evident in each of the protagonists. Miyazaki's protagonists are quite akin to Alice from Lewis Carrol's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, featuring young female leads as they journey through newly discovered mystical worlds.Although Howl's Moving Castle contains a slightly darker theme with a violent war ravaging the world and Spirited Away has a lighter and more upbeat feel, both are excellent films laden heavy with Miyazaki's beautiful and sublime visions coupled with a mystical, romantic adventure. read more 
Besides that both are made from Hayao Miyazaki, they both represent pure love and friendship. Spirited Away is about a girl, Chihiro, who depends on her friends to save her family from the magical world which they do not belong in and Howl's Moving Castle's, Sophie, relies on her friends, one of them supplies major eye candy, to release her from a curse. They both have happy endings and are films that are in my top ten favorite movies (Spirited Away is one of Roger Ebert's favorite movies) and they will definitely be yours too. 
Both have gorgeous art and they both dwell in fantasy and the supernatural. They also have the same producers so they have similar art styles. What's more, they both have fascinating plots and lovable characters. 
Same producers, Studio Ghibli. Both of the movies have a great story, same genre, romance, fantasy, supernatural, adventure and a very good drama. Both of movies are great and worth watching, has great lessons of love and friendship between the cast/characters of both of the movies.  
Like magic? Like inventive transportation? The creators of Spirited Away and the talented voices of Billy Crystal, Lauren Bacall, Christian Bale, Jean Simmons, and Emily Mortimer bring Howl's Moving Castle to life. See a world where wizards and witches fight in a war and curses are cast on the innocent so nothing and no one is quite what it seems. 
The plots are different but both have a girl as the protagonist as they accidently get involved in another world full of magical elements and fantasy.  
Two different movies and both made by Hayao Miyazki. Both movies are highly creative, involve magical elements, very light underlying romance between the two characters and are both about a young girl who is leading an average life until suddenly being whisked away into a magical/spiritual adevnture.  
Both were made by the same director and producer. Both are about a relationship between a human girl and an unusual guy. Both are fantasy, and the character's main goal is the same: remove the curse. 
Sophie & Chihiro sound like they're both dreaming aren't they? They think they're dreaming and both are very dark anime. But actually it was really half-real and half-fantasy 
Both are fantastical, dream-like, magical, captivating stories of Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli. 
These two movies are very similar. The ideas are almost like a copy of each other! One week after I had seen Spirited Away, I saw Howl's Moving Castle, and yet I was amazed by it! They made me realize what love truly means! 
For starters, they both are breathtaking movies from Studio Ghibli. The art and animation in both are so similar that the characters look a lot alike. The main protagonists (who are both girls) have a curse put onto them or their family, so they're sent on a journey to break that curse. Howl's Moving Castle and Spirited Away are adventurous, fantasy, and romance movies that will draw your interest in from start to finish. 
These two titles are excellent example of unique love stories. I mean, we have female protagonists whos adventures are the main plots of these titles. Chihiro and Sophie have to give up their normal lives. Consequently, they meet their beloveds who are really mysterious and powerful persons. And what it is worth mentioning is the fact that they are great titles for whole families. Every family's member will appreciate other thing and anyone won't be disappointed after them. They are the great start for people who think that anime is only ""Chinese porn cartoons for kids""... they are but not in this case. 
Obviously both have there similarities as they are both studio ghibli films. However these 2 in particular have a very simile feel.  
Both anime movies are produced by Studio Ghibli and directed by Hayao Miyazaki. They have similar animation and character design, as well as great landscapes and soundtracks by Joe Hisaishi. Both contain coming of age narratives, following a young heroine in a magical world filled with magic and spirits. In both anime, the protagonist have to find a way to break a spell. 
Studio ghibli flavour 
The two epic fantasy-ghibli movies. In my opinion Howl's the best.Perfect animations and draws, beatiful and detailed landscapes and unforgottable OST. Both in the same level, just the best combination of the franchise.The characters are charismatic and very unique; the stories are entertaining and interesting.I Think that Howl has better or deeper characters and the story is less complicated, but both are a must see if you like the anime and/or the movies. 
Both of these films are made from the well known Studio Ghibli - both of these films have the the weird but lovable story lines the studio is known for. They both have fantastic characters and the artwork is great!Similarities - 'Quirky' story line's with the intriguing characters. 
-Same Studio ""Ghibli""-Director, Script, Screenplay, Executive Producer by ""Miyazaki, Hayao""-Drama, Adventure-Sound by ""Hisaishi, Joe"" -Same Producer ""Suzuki, Toshio"" 
Both Miyazaki films will take you to a magical world. Both films are masterpieces in my mind that features (a) a beautiful fantasy world, (b) amazing character building - watch the characters grow and mature and learn about themselves as they embark on their adventure, and (c) a great story -- Both stories are wonderful deep adventures that will leave you craving to learn more about the world and the characters. I'm impressed by how much both movies are able to capture in under 2 hours. i watched spirited away when I was 10 years old and it's remained my favorite animated film throughout my childhood and well into my adult life.

I love all of his movies, Princess Mononoke being my favorite, but out of all his movies, this one is my second favorite. The animation is great as well as the characters. It has a great plot and another curse. In many ways, Howl's Moving Castle is similar to Princess Mononoke. "
431,523,2,"Both Miyazaki films I think the animation in both are amazing. Just like Totoro, Howl's Moving Castle is a moving a passionate Anime experience. 
Both are fantastical, dream-like, magical, captivating stories of Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli. "
431,32281,1,"Both are beautifully animated and heartwarming films that have similar imagery of shooting stars and several plot simiarities, such as time-slip elemtns and the main girl cutting her hair short. Sophie and Mitsuha feel a little similar to me, as they are both very strong young women but are not quite happy with themselves and the lives they lead. "
2001,30,29,"With a highly diverse cast that is both well rounded and lovable and a story line that continues to expand and evolve. The classic Evangelion is worth you time if you appreciated the story telling that Gainax can do so well and aren't afraid to think a little. 
Same animation studio, similar spontaneous kinds of moments. Both are based around mecha and have out-of-this-world enemies. Just, Gurren Lagann has drills and that lovely yellow moped. 
Imagine Evangelion if Shinji finally stops being reluctant, mans up, and kicks the **** out of every thing in his way, and a lot less mindf***ery.  That's Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann.  It is an Incredibly awesome Kick-reason-to-the-curb anime that leaves you so full of energy that you feel like yelling for 2 hours after watching the final battle.  Yeah, it's that awesome. 
They're both mecha series from Gainax, and that's where the similarities end, but that's really the point. Evangelion is a deconstruction of mecha anime, basically saying, ""You know how all those other mecha series made piloting a giant robot look fun? Well I'll show you how miserable it can really be."" Gurren Lagann is a reconstruction; a decade later, saying, ""You know how those mecha deconstruction series made piloting a giant robot look really awful? Well I'll show you how AWESOME it can really be!"" The persistent despair of the former and unshakable optimism of the latter make excellent counterpoints and contrast beautifully. 
Both are seminal must-watch mecha series from Gainax. But they are not similar--rather they should be watched because they contrast so well. Whereas TTGL boasts over-the-top action and is an all-around fun show, NGE goes down to the nitty gritty of piloting mechas, and is ultimately psychological and somewhat depressive. Both shows are also complemented by very nicely developed characters. 
Evangelion is known for its artistic command of scale and its ability to express a sense of enormity, contrasted with physical and psychological isolation, has yet to be surpassed in all Art. Only Gurren Lagann has transcended the physical sense of scale of Eva. The iconic climax of End of Evangelion may have been influenced by the animation of Macross Plus. 
NGE is in many ways the ""evil twin"" of TTGL. Made by the same production company (Gainax) back in the 1990's, it starts out as a somewhat-normal super-robot show. However, it eventually becomes a brutal deconstruction of the entire super-robot genre. Featuring a pathologically-passive protagonist, his eternally distant father, and a whole cast of other very flawed characters, NGE is just as much a psychological character study as it is an action show. Overall, it is very dark, a total mindscrew, and likely will leave you with a lot of questions and a somewhat uneasy feeling.I'd recommend watching NGE BEFORE you watch TTGL, because the latter will provide the catharsis you will desperately need after watching the former. Where NGE deconstructs the genre, TTGL REconstructs it gloriously. They should be watched in that order, and not the other way around. read more 
First of all, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is kind of like a parody of Neon Genesis Evangelion. Both Series have a protagonist with similar personalities (Simon/Shinji), and both shows have similar looking Mechas (Lazengann/EVA 01).They are both made by Studio Gainax.Neon Genesis Evangelion is  ""darker"", more serious compared to Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. I recommend watching Neon Genesis Evangelion first, then Gurren Lagann. 
Both are Gainex mecha anime in which a young teenager must step up to pilot a giant mecha and use it to fight enemies on a colossal scale to save humanity. 
Both protagonists are self-conscious boys that fight for their lives in mech battles. One has a role model to reassure him when his self-loathing gets the best of him while the other does not. 
It's like Neon Genesis Evangelion but with Shinji actually GETTING IN THE ROBOT most of the time and undergoing hardcore character development into one of the most badass characters EVER. OH AND DRILLS. 
GURREN LAGANN IS THE OPPOSITE OF NEON GENESIS. Ok, you might be confused, as they are opposite there are some similarities, both follow a wimpy push over gifted with a powerful machine and must save the world, but that's where they diverge. While Neon Genesis is a mecha that's very depressing and serious; rooted in heavy themes. TTGL takes a more light hearted and energetic approach to mecha world. Its interesting to see how the series mirror each other, especially since they are both produced by the same company. 
Gurren Lagann is a whole different kind of mecha. If you like evangelion but are looking for slightly more modern art and in my opinion a better plot, then Lagann is for you.  
I recommend this anime because all their episodes are good, do not have a boring episode is action from beginning to end, is must watch it. 
This is how NGE would end up if Shinji had a role model or someone who was with him to guide him while growing up. Definetly better to watch this after Evangelion as you can truly see both paths bad and good in persons development in adolescence. 
Two productions of Gainax studio, and although they are very different from each other, also have some similarities as the Mecha theme, although Evangelion focuses more on the psychological genre, since TTGL focuses more on action. 
I don't know why, but these series are very similar, at least for me. Main charater is similar to other one. If you watched Neon Genesis Evangelion and liked it, go ahead and watch Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann too. 
If you liked Gurren Lagann, you have to watch Evangelion.I mean Evangelion is the father of mecha anime, it is a must watch for mecha lovers. 
At first glance, Neon Genesis Evangelion and Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann have very little in common. Yes, both are highly regarded mecha shows, and yes, both were created by studio Gainax. That, however, is pretty much where the similarities end.Evangelion takes an unforgiving, almost cynical look at the common and widespread premise of many mecha shows - various circumstances forcing teenagers to pilot giant robots in deadly battles. While this wasn't exactly unique at the time, the show deservedly became a classic with its masterful direction and great depth, when exploring the psychology of its cast.12 years later, TTGL came out, and it was nothing like it. In fact, it was more similiar to Diebuster, another mecha show by Gainax, in its use of over-the-top action and a likeable set of characters. From the beginning, it feels like an antithesis to everything NGE stands for and as it progresses, it executes on this feeling perfectly.So, have you watched NGE and feel the void after one of the most iconic endings of anime? Do you love it when Gainax goes crazy and brings us a show that exceeds all expectations? Then look no further. Watch Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. You will not regret it. read more 
Mecha on a more serious note with a more seriously themed plot; a good mecha to also have on your watch list hand-in-hand with Gurren Lagann. 
The two are masterpieces created by Gainax, Good art, Good characters, Good world construction, etc 
The only similarity is the mecha. I'd mostly recommend this if you want a complete tonal shift. In many ways, this anime is the anti-Evangelion, foregoing the introspection and despair of humanity's collective fate that Eva presents for a spectacle of the highest order. Gurren Lagann is both mindless and thought-provoking, with a core message that power comes from within, championing the indomitable spirit of the spiral races xD. 
In many ways, Gurren Lagann was a response to NGE. Both similar in how they influenced the industry and a genre into something else; one was a psychoanalytical work on the human condition and the other was a character study on what it means to do the right thing! Watch them! 
Mecha battlesMC is a whiny bitchEVA is an epic show and you need to watch it 
Both of them have an amazing plot for mecha genre. Also they have great character development. The fighting scenes for all moments are very emotional. The most interesting thing about this anime is the drama that can make you feel a little sympathetic. It's worth to watch 
The two pillars of mecha. Classic shows, except one happens to have a lot less existential depression. If Evangelion is about recognizing the importance of love for yourself and others, Gurren Lagann is about breaking the perceived limitations that trap us in order to develop our best selves and achieve the impossible. Watch these masterpieces. They were both made by Gainax (when they were still genius) anyway. 
Mecha anime with a story line that continues to evolve. Similar animation studio, the protagonist have similar personalities, basically they're young teenagers that must step up to pilot a giant mecha and use it to fight against colossal monsters! Evangelion is more darker in turns of the plot and the tone, but they are both entertaining to watch. 
Both are mecha anime where a group of people has to fight certain species using giant robots in order to achieve that group's ultimate goal. 
If you like trauma and giant mechs fighting tthan you will love those "
2001,1575,16,"These two series both have heavy dosages of mecha, though its mecha done right, when there ARE casualties and sacrifices are made, though Gurren Lagann is less thinking, it still has the right combination of elements to keep you glued to the screen and want more. Think Gurren Lagann as a lighter, less intelligent type, that has a wider scope then Code Geass. 
Though the series main characters are vastly different and Gurren Lagann might be considered a ""lighter"" anime, both of these series engaged me and made me addictively watch as much as 20 eps a day. Additionally, both series fighting is done in mecha and they fight against superpowers with little more than their wills. 
Code Geass and Tegen Toppa Gurren Lagann both involve mecha, and of course, lot's of action. Although the fighting in Code Geass is essentially against one enemy, and in Gurren Lagann, the enemy/opponent varies, it is still clear that there is a protagonist and antagonist in each story. Both take place in the future, as well. In both, the protagonists is a strong character, who has the support of several characters. Both are exciting, and involve a lot of action, as well as some comedy and romance. =)  
Both are mecha animes that envolve around war. Both implement stratigies in their battles however Gurren Lagan is a bit more silly and random. It's like you combined Code Geass with FLCL.  But if you like Code Geass defently try out Gurren Lagann 
They both have have themes of rebellion & oppression. They have very intelligent and talented main cast of characters. They both have amazing art styles with outstanding character design. They are also both Action Mecha anime. The characters are both likeable and relatable. They both have top tier OST's and are both considered classics. 
Similarities : mecha, heroes starts as rebel force fighting against much more powerful opponent, there is one strongly determined leader to whom everybody look up to. Mysterious power working behind scene.Differences: while Gurren Lagann is mainly using comedy to relieve tension after dramatic moments (and there is plenty of those), Code Geass use more serious note in its storytelling. 
Mecha,masterminding about something that very badass,future world and super badass duel scenes among robots are main features that both anime shares. 
Thematically, both series are very similar! Both include large-scale mecha fights, and a plot about overthrowing the government. Gurren Lagann is a great show and well worth a watch. 
Both use a Mecha genre to house underlying intellectual questions and reflections on modern society and the human experience. Both of the anime follow the Hero's Journey very closely (look it up), and follow similar themes of sacrifice, morality and the human condition of betrayal. Both series have amazing character development, although Code Geass starts off a little slow compared to Gurren Lagann in this sense. I'd really recommend persisting past the first 3-4 episodes if you find them a little dry, you won't regret it. 
Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch & Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann are both very renowed and revolutionary series in the Mecha Anime genre. They have a lot of things in common such as the evolution of the main characters, the beautiful designs of the supporting cast and the mechas, the teamwork and interactions with the other characters, the very absorbing plot and the amazing mecha battles in combination with the breathtaking music. In general the entire setting makes it so that by being fascinated by either series it is worth embracing the other as well. 
Both shows are mechas, and ones that non-mecha fans would enjoy. In Code Geass you have a mysterious power as well as interesting tactics, Gurren Laggen has unlikely wins through awesome scenes. Check both out 
If you enjoyed Code Geass then you'll most definitely without fail enjoy this. 
You might think these two are incredibly different style of show, but the concepts and messages are exactly the same. Character motives are similar and the anime's ending are very similar. That and monstrous mecha fights, such great tense action sequences. 
Both stand out mechas from the early 2000's. Dub casts are also very similar. While thematically they are both very different they feel like opposites on the same coin. There are strong conclusions to both franchises and action packed fights loaded with emotional scenes displaying the personalities of the cast. 
Both are amazing mecha anime that cane out around the same time and are highly rated on MAL. Although TTGL is less serious and more comedic than Code Geass. 
1. Mecha2. Nice plot twists3. Action packed4. Similar Episode length "
2001,16498,11,"1. Both have strong character stories2. both have a sense of moving forward3. both have great animationOverall there are a lot of similarities with the story line, being trapped (with giant monsters) striving to achieve something greater for the whole race.  Both shows are very uplifting and fun to watch.  
Humans live trapped in a secluded area in fear of giant monsters. Brave souls, in both anime, wish to venture out into the outside. 
While the style of Gurren Lagann is completely different from that of Shingeki no Kyojin, I couldn't help but be reminded of Gurren Lagann while watching this series. In both series, the main characters are attempting to overthrow a seemingly impossible force and escape from an enclosed environment in order to explore the outside world. Also, both animes have an overly enthusiastic main character, a ""sidekick"" to the main character who appears to be nothing but a crybaby, and a bad-ass female character.  Despite the plot and character similarities though, the two anime are very different. Shingeki no Kyojin is FAR more serious than Gurren Lagann, and this could be either a good or a bad thing depending on your preferences. read more 
SnK and TTGL both have a certain style of art that are very particular. Both focus mainly on two guys and a girl, with other characters coming in from time to time. The main character will sometimes turn into your typical shounen fighter beast, but that's ok because they're both epic nonetheless. From my experience, the goosebumps they give make me watch certain episodes again and again. 
Both aim for the freedom of the human society. both have tragic loses of their loved ones. the story is bloody amazing. you would be mad not to watch both and shed a few tears when you see deaths/ 
Mankind is stuck within a certain place (for Shingeki in walls and Gurren Lagann in caves). In both, they fight the entities that hold them there. 
Both anime deal with the human condition being slowly crushed under the weight of an enormous threat that wages genocide on them seemingly without reason.TTGL however is much less visceral and more lighthearted although possessing just as much testosterone-filled action and determination to succeed against all odds. TTGL is also a deconstruction of the mecha genre and anime in general. It is a semi-parody(in classic Gainax style) but also includes a fair amount of drama, good characters and serious plot. The war presented in TTGL does have its deeper moments, and great twists brought about by the characters and their reactions to the escalating challenges they face... but nowhere near as much as SNK.Shingeki no Kyojin is a much darker anime, with a much more present sense of hopelessness and is primarily psychological, a deconstruction of the human condition. It depicts much more hopelessness, fear, selfishness, betrayal, loss, and suffering. I would rate SNK being the better of the two however read more 
Both series involve a story where the characters are enclosed within some sort of barrier as there are potential threats that reside outside of that barrier. The main protagonists of both series have big dreams to travel outside their enclosed realm and adventure out into the unknown.Both series involve over the top battles with beautifully animated action scenes. Also, there are many epic scenes that showcase over the top drama and tension.Both series involve a vast array of interesting characters. However, because of the imminent dangers that they must face, you don't know which characters will survive until the end. 
Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann involves being locked inside an underground city and battling robots, which is very similar to Shingeki no Kyojin, where they are surrounded by walls and battle titans. 
Sort of post-apocalyptic and focuses on a young protagonist as you see them grow up and go through different things. 
Society living enclosed from the outside world and basically both MCs wanna go see the outside world which is nothing that they expected it to be. Many challenges face their way as they try their best to eradicate all their enemies that face their way and reclaim the world for human kind "
2001,6114,9,"Rainbow and Gurren Lagann are two shows that take place in vastly different worlds, but they both share the theme of brotherhood and sacrificing oneself for the sake of others. Although both shows have that standard shonen theme flowing through the story and characters, Rainbow tends to be more mature in expressing that brotherly bond, whereas GL is more lively and animated. If you liked Rainbow's passionate portrayal of brotherhood, then you might like Gurren Lagann.

-Both have a leader to some sort of team-The leader and main character have extremely similar relationships in both-Both have great character development-Both climax midway through but despite this, keep going 
At first glance, these two might not be similar, but both are about the endurance of the human spirit and the importance of friendship in harsh times.

2001,6675,9,"Every so often, an experience comes along that kicks you in the face. Gurren Lagann is brimming with adrenaline and GAR-fueled moments, and Redline might be the only other piece of animation that matches it in magnitude. A racing film at heart, there are intense action scenes and gorgeous visuals that raise the bar for animation in film. While its narrative is definitely lacking, I will guarantee that you will have a smile plastered onto your face by the end.Don't miss this film. 
Both series have similar artwork as well as crazy action that is out of this world.The main male protagonist from both series is also daring and courageous often willing to take risks. The female protagonists in both series also have similiar personalities.There are a lot of action scenes, drama, comedy, and some romance.Both series are very fast paced and contains a noticeable soundtrack. 
Both Redline and Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann (TTGL) have similar style of animation, that is the standard goodness of Gainax. TTGL and the movie focus on the action, much more than plot, and are something that would be enjoyed more if we just relax and watch the awesomeness. 
Gurren Lagann and Redline are similar shows in only a few aspects as the two are in different genres, Gurren Lagann being a mecha and Redline being a racing anime. They are also animated by different studios Gurren Lagann being done by Trigger and Redline being done by Mad House. Redline stands as a single movie with no extensions where as Gurren Lagann is a 27 episode series with multiple ovas, specials, etc. However both of them also have very crazy and unique art-styles; practically throwing colors everywhere. As well as the two sharing a very similar way of being told in how they both increasingly get more over the top with every minute you watch with both leading up to a mind-boggling finale that will only leave you thinking ""What a journey"". They also share the fact that you need to watch both at one point or another. read more

Although the plot and characters in TTGL are amazing, I feel the main reason many people love it so much is due to how much fun the show is to watch, and if anything can replicate how much fun watching spiral powered mechs combine is, it’s illegal space racing. Don't be turned away from Redline due it being about racing, to call the things they drive 'cars' is a vast understatement, and are as close to normal race cars as the Gurren is to an average mech.Both are over the top awesomeness incarnate and stay at full throttle the whole way through, with Redlines amazing animation showcasing this brilliantly.  read more 
Both anime feature an artstyle that resembles much some found in western animation (though TTGL's is more cartoony), have an exaggerated feel, over-the-top action, bright choices of colors and are manly in an enjoyable way. They also share various sci-fi elements and feature non-human races too. 
Fast-paced, really likable characters, a unique art-style and is simply full of personality.Both great in his own little world, give them a chance. 
Redline and Gurren Lagann share very similar aesthetics, style, and the same crazy love for speed and momentum which is so prevalent and heart-pounding and it isn't just coincidence since both anime share several key animators (Katsuya Yamada, Sushio, and Hiroyuki Imaishi).But while I can say that they share a similar style and aimation I also have to say that they are also pretty different with their executions since Redline is more of a thrilling 24/7 ride than Gurren Lagann which is a pretty deep and impactful show. "

Both are about humanity achieving a goal that is not thought possible since they are far weaker than their enemy. Also, Schwi and Nia are very similar characters. 
Two completely opposite takes on pretty much the same idea of humaity being on the brink of destructionbecause of war with other races. Willstr NGNL0 is more drama focused Gurren Lagann is more comedy, over the top. "

Either way, if you watch either, be prepared for one heck of a ride!Important note:The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya is only a movie you can only fully appreciate if you have watched the previous two seasons adapted before it. 
Both of these series start of quite light and humorous, before the real plot takes place. in both stories the protagonist has to use time travel to change the world to the way it originally was. Going through a lot of mental strain and hardships. 
Both Anime deals with time-travel, and the MC time-travel many times just so he can fix/save the world/time he came from, both anime starts off normally but it turns NUTS really quick and there's a lot of twist along the way, both series have amazing soundtrack & character art.......Over all both anime is one of the best anime I ever watched 
The plot lines are extremely similar because they follow a lone protagonist struggling through alternate or distorted timelines. Both shows do a great job of portraying the main character's thoughts feelings as they experience this dilemma. Both are brilliant pieces of work and should be watched not only be fans of Steins Gate and Haruhi Suzumiya, but by any fan of anime in general. 
Both shows have time travel and really keep you on the edge of your seat!! 
Both involves time traveling in order to restore the world line with very similar scenes that will give off vibes to the other anime. 
The plot of these two anime is very similar. Both deal with time travel and while one deals with other things such as aliens and espers the plot follows remarkably a similar line. This is a movie and you have to see the whole series beforehand. But when you are going to see the movie you will inevitably think of steins gate. 
Both Kyon and okabe must bear great burden to make everythings get normal. If you like story about time travel/time leap, I recommend to watch Suzumiya Haruhi no Shoushitsu and suzumiya series too.  
These masterpiece have a lot of similarities like time traveling, and has one of the biggest plot twist that I have ever watched, if you like some sci-fi that has something to do with time then I recommend you watching this amazing shows. "

Let's get one thing straight The Disappearance is a masterpiece, no anime sequel film has ever or likely will ever touch the level of quality that it delivers. However, I get why people compare these two, they do have a similar tone, similar characters. If you want something like The Disappearance, you could do worse than this one.  
if you're a spinoff movie for a popular science fiction/slice of life/dramedy anime series about emotional high schoolers dealing with supernatural events and your plot relies heavily on time travel paradoxes raise your hand  
First off, both movies/series are a must watch. If you haven't seen one of these add them to your watch list immediately. (bunny senpai movie is available to watch outside of cinemas as of a few weeks ago)the Suzumiya movie is widely regarded as a masterpiece and struck the attention of many anime fans when it was released. The fan base were largely skeptical about the previous season but were blown away by how well crafted the movie turned out. Bunny girl senpai gives off a very similar vibe, it's quiet, understated and slow-building but goes from 1-100 very quick. The movie struck me in the same way Suzumiya did all those years ago. Trust me, if you've been putting either of these shows off or haven't yet watched the movies you should go do it right now. read more 
Both Anime have a very similar, dark tone and atmosphere. The plot is also suprisingly similar to the point where a complete coincidence is hard to believe, having the Main Character try to save the ones he loves alone without any idea how to. And even if I think Haruhi Suzumiya is far better at almost every level, everyone should check out both movies if they are interested. 
-They share a very similar plot - Time travel by the characters in order to change something in their relative present-Both serve as a sequel movie to a pretty good TV series-Very similar vibes from the both of them, so give it a go... You might enjoy it :) "
7311,32281,5,"Both are phenomenal movies that handle a beautiful romance that explores the themes of loss as well as stretches the bonds of a relationship through time and space. Haruhi is a bit more introspective and downtrodden, while Kimi no Na wa is a more upbeat movie. 
Finding and bringing back the one mc loves... also includes lost memory, supernatural, time travel, etc.  
Both movies are masterfully directed and gain high marks in all aspects that a viewer would use to critically watch film. 
- Both are about disappearance - Both invoke warm feelings- Both are easy-to-watch 
As a romance story, i think its pretty same for me. And the plan to the time leap idea from the story really made this two movie seems so simmilar. I just always remembering all of this two same movie with slightly concept on everyday at my life.  "
7311,15335,2,"Both movies are sequels to their respective series. In both movies, something happens and the protagonist is teleported into a familiar yet different world in which the protagonist doesn't exist. Both protagonists then proceed to make sense of why they are brought here and seek ways to return to their original world. 
In both movies our main characters happen to be to different worlds where no one of those they knew could recognize them, thus making our characters firstly to feel sad and then try hard to change the world! "

The enemy forces are unknown creatures without a clear origin ,with the traitors everywhere,The environment is isolated from the other world   
My first impression of this anime : 'This feels awfully like Attack on Titan'There are three main protagonists like Eren, Armin and Mikasa. They were surrounded by wall and trying to escape it (Although the wall doesn't play that big role in here like in Attack on Titan does). There's also these human eater creatures. Also I think Eren say something similar about them being trapped inside a wall like cattle. Well, in this case they are literally the cattle.I'd say there are also Death Note feel to it, but I lean more towards Attack on Titan. 
A group of people trapped inside of walls trying to escape from ""monsters "" that are trying to eat them. Both groups do some kind of training, trying to fight/escape the titans/demons. The main three characters of each anime have some similarities as well. 
If you liked the plot about humans not being on the top of the food chain in Attack on Titan then you will definitely like story about kids trying to escape the fate of being eaten in The Promised Neverland 
At first sight these animes may not have to much similarities but the sensations of mistery and intrigue to know what is outside the primary and early location of the plot. 
Both shows feature characters inside an area closed off by a wall/fence, possibly keeping someone/something out. Without spoiling much, they're both dark and are based on the main characters trying to survive their situations. 
Both manga are about humans trying to surrive in a world in which they aren't the dominant predators anymore. 
Both have a scary deep world where there is creatures that are a huge threat for the human race and the main characters are trying to get out of their bubble that they have been locked in to try to kill/stop the creatures that are basically eating humans as their lunch 
Both are dark, mystery horror series with lovable characters, nice ost and awesome animation.  
The setting of both shows is very similar.Both shows start of with three main charakters living in a place encircled by walls seperating them from the outside world.The main charakters both have a very strong sense of freedom and have their own idea of a true peaceful life.They also have a very dark atmosphere and lots of mysteries about the world with some twists here and there.   
Both series made me scream at the end of almost every episode with those unexpected cliffhangers, making me have to dreadfully wait for yet another week to find out what plot twist the producers put in once again. 
In both anime - children heroes live in a cage surrounded by monsters. 
same concept on what's in the outside world . 
Both have mystery, being trapped behind a wall and monsters trying to kill them 
-eating humans-trying to discover the world outside-smart protagonists 
Walls, man-eating monsters, and ways to escape, both of these keep you on the edge of your seat.  
Both animes make you ask alot of questions about the anime, there also leaves alot of cliff hangers too which adds suspense 
Both very dark anime, with great storylines 
Both have creatures that are a huge source of fear for the humans characters as they actively eat people.  
Both anime about humans trying to survive from other creatures😶 
Both based on determination to survive, strategy making and existential themes. Arguably Promised Neverland is more intense about all the three mentioned above but that's subjective since it handles that in a more subtle and often plot driven way. It's attention intensive due to that reason. Comparatively, it has more psychological horror, strategy making, mystery and suspense instead of action but also with less edge of the seat moments. The promised neverland although has similar and very well-written characters, doesn't have as much character variation and if action wasn't AoT's best aspect for you, it can definitely fill the hole AoT leaves.Without comparison, Promised neverland is it's own approach at the same themes seen in AoT and it's very good at it, as do the ratings speak for themselves. It's an anime worth watching on it's own. read more 
In both of the anime, there are 'monsters' that eat human beings.In both of the anime, humans want to get past the wall and know what is and what can be seen beyond it.In both of the anime, tactics and strategies are needed to get past the wall. In short terms, humans are using their brains and not force or magic powers.  
-main characters want to know what's beyond the walls-humans are food -action, horror, gore 
Both shows are very similar in concept. Without going into spoilers, they follow the same structure. Think of The Promised Neverland Season 1 as the equivalent of Attack on Titan Seasons 1-3, as they can both be separated in two parts: before “x discovery” and after “x discovery”. The story-telling and world-building in both shows are great and I’m excited to see how The Promised Neverland will follow Attack on Titan’s footsteps. 
Both anime are dark fantasy, and are set in a world where monstrous creatures feed on humans. Both of them add a horror-mystery element to the shounen genre. Both serve up the mystery and worldbuilding bit by bit, doing so beautifully. And there is a lot of character death, of course. Both have characters that completely change the perspective of the audience from what we initially thought. And also, remember to never underestimate the side characters of these shows! 
deep world building and edge of your seat plot are both in these super popular thrillers that will have your mind searching for unknown answers 
Both anime are mystery anime with a lot of suspense and the characters are stuck in similar circumstances. 
Prey fights back. Also both anime have the question, what’s on the outside? 
Post-apocalypse! World-building! Plot twist! If you like animes that are dark then Attack on Titan and Promised Neverland are the best for you. People trapped inside the walls in attack on Titan and kids trapped in farmhouse. Both are similar in plot wise that it will get you invested throughout the whole show. Both involving mystery you will love it. These shoes are a must watch in case of my opinion. 
They are both good at thriller and people in this anime acts so realistic. 
both of the animes want freedom, both of the animes are also about escaping 
Both anime have a strong mystery element that will make you question the nature of what exactly is lurking outside. What is outside? What is the world like? As a viewer, you really want to find out. This mystery will grip you almost instantly!  
There both inside walls and about to get eaten by 'monsters'.  
Dystopian out of the world,both mc are 3,the rests are cannon fodder 
1.Both anime have similar story as AOT focusses  on Titan on the other hand The promise neverland focusses  on demons who are tried to eat human meat. 
Yakusoku no Neverland is almost similar to Shingeki no Kiyojin because they are inside the walls without knowing what is outside the walls. They want to go outside the wall. And there are man eating Demons/Titans. 
If you enjoy the dark mystery of Attack on Titan I can't recommended The Promised Neverland (Yakusoku no Neverland) enough. "
37779,34599,33,"Both share the setting of an orphanage, being closed down from the outside world, having little kids as  protagonist, the turn from a vibrant to a very dark setting 
Both anime feature children that have to go through some bad circumstances while they explore the world around them (In The Promised Neverland they have to, in Made in Abyss they want to).  
Both focus on young children characters but have a darker tone to the show despite the cute characters. Both have these cute children juxtaposed with a dark & unforgiving world.Both have the main characters struggle to survive in a extremely hostile environment.  
Both The Promised Neverland and Made in Abyss look seemingly ""cute"" and rather lighthearted at first glance. Yet later on in the journey, you realize it's more than that - the world in which they live in are more mysterious and there's more to this than meets the eye. I absolutely LOVE both shows because of the world building, but also because of the ride you are brought on. Each episode, the audience are learning more alongside the characters.  
Both have young protagonists facing against dark and dangerous situations. The odds are seemingly against them but they press on. The female main characters are also portrayed as smart, capable, and determined. 
When I watched Made In Abyss in 2017, I found that this anime had a lot of similarities to The Promised Neverland.First, the characters. Both anime focused on a group of kids who lived in an orphanage. Living in a limited area (as the adults prohibited them to go to certain places) made them wonder, how does it feel to be outside.Next, the design. Both anime have cute character designs that if you recommend it to someone who just watched anime (or someone who only watches specific genres), they would probably answer ""Sorry, I'm not into childish anime"". Nonetheless, both anime have astonishing art.And the last is the story. Even though the character design is cute, but the story isn't cute at all. The atmosphere turned dark pretty quick. The outside world is not as nice as they think it could be. They have to fight and run from terrifying creatures in order to survive. read more 
Both are mysteries about orphaned children who explore and discover horrible secrets about the worlds they live in. Both shows are pretty dark. In both shows, this tone is contrasted by the presence of an optimistic and driven female protagonist. They are both excellent, high-quality stories with great world-building. 
They both have similar themes, and can turn dark really fast. Both have small twists in their stories in unexpected directions. Both have several main characters that are children and that the story revolves around. Both are high quality! 
With Made in Abyss being one of my favourite anime's of all time, with in the first minute of watching The Promised Neverland it instantly made me think of this show and their similarities.They are both based on orphan children and the mysteries of their world, yearning to explore and learn more about what there is to the unseen eye. They both start off rather sweet and innocent and turn to a dark chilling atmosphere. You are constantly gripping on and wishing the best for these children with high hopes of getting on with their journeys. They are fragile and innocent characters who are naive and have a lot to learn which makes them facing these hard and terrifying tasks all the more emotional.Both leave you with the feeling of wanting to see the mysteries behind their worlds and rooting for the characters success as they face the many dangers. Both are very dark and emotional and have scenes that leave you with goosebumps, highly recommended. read more 
The adventure starts when  main protagonists decide they need to see what outside (or ""inside"" in the case of Made in Abyss).  Both have unique kid characters designs  and are initially set in orphanages. Escaping turns difficult because it´s forbidden by adults. The art  in the manga depict fantastic settings and atmosphere and this is properly adapted in both anime. The story will lead kids into an adventure that, unfortunatly, hold the possibility of damaging their physical integrity.  
Both are about adorable looking orphans finding themselves in unfortunate circumstances. 
It's a story about children going through dangerous encounters. Just like in Yakusoku no Neverland, this serie is an adventure with a dark tone to it. 
Surviving in a world full of danger and the unknown. 
Both are emotional and action-packed stories set in alternate fantasy universes about kids living happy, comfortable lives who learn dark secrets about their world, and go on an adventure to uncover the truth. 
Both stories are centred around kids and get better and more intense as they progress. Both have a really nice plot! 
Cute children in a mysterious world that only gets darker and harder to live in. This is the thing that anime does best. A kawaii veneer over a tragic world. 
If you've seen Made in Abyss, you might recognize the heavy tension that perpetually hangs over the series and the degree of mystery that surrounds it. I think the same can be said for Yakusoku no Neverland, as you are never truly sure of what lies beyond the ""farm"" that the children live on, which is similar because in Made in Abyss it's unclear what creatures and challenges lie further in the abyss. The main characters in both series also have lost their parents and live in some sort of orphanage, although in Yakusoku no Neverland the orphanage or ""farm"" is the main setting for the first season while Made in Abyss the orphanage is only briefly present as the abyss is obviously the main setting.  read more 
 - Seemingly cute, but turn out to be pretty dark - Cast of little kids from orphanage - Mysterious world that gets revealed piece by piece 
In both shows, little kids try to overcome something much much bigger than them. 
-both have smart MC kids that are faced with dangerous situations-very unique stories with great world-building. -unlike the cute characters or ed, it turns out to be pretty dark 
-Good Horror-Orphanage protagonists-Mystery world vibe-Temporary happiness-Thrilling experiences 
They want to find out things outside where they currently are from things they heard or saw.Have a purpose, becomes very dark at some bits.Fun but deep at the same time. 
Journey along hope as characters in both titles prevail over overwhelming odds and absolute evil.Both also involve small children that have more survivability and brain cells compared to your average adult that its almost completely unbelievable! 
Both deals with really young protagonists who faces really messed up scenarios 
Probably the closest in the sense that the protagonists are orphans with a dark and perilous journey ahead of them. The difference there being that in Made in Abyss they are moving toward the danger whereas in Promised Neverland, they are trying to escape it.I'd recommend this show mainly because it captures that tense feeling of insurmountable odds being stacked against the main leads, a lot of the time you are wondering if giving up might be the less painful option, whereas continuing with the quest may not be for the best. The evil in either show seems to be the world itself and how life simply is. They will both leave you with the feeling of anguish but also with hope. Both beautifully written and animated. I would honestly recommend either show to anyone regardless of similarities to each other or other popular anime's. read more 
They both look childish from the outside but yet the setting is very dark. 
Both are dark anime, and have children being hurt bad 
Both have excellent stories; Thrilling and suspenseful plot twists; The main cast is comprised of children; The art styles are unique; animation quality is very good for both; and both provide tons of entertainment and excitement that make you want to watch more. 
Both are dark thrillers featuring young children and have a survival element to them. There's also a sense that you don't quite know the full picture of the world in both stories (what's at the bottom of the abyss/what's outside grace field house?), which got me hooked! 
Yakusoku no Neverland and Made in Abyss Both HaveAn orphanage as a settingChildren as the protagonists Main characters who witness the brutally of their fictional worlds A sharp turn to a very dark environment 
both of them really good, though the promised neverland is closer to the tension and horror part 
These two have a lot in common where the characters have the same backgrounds and they are fighting against the unknown and trying to find out an answer to their curiosities and anxieties. 
These animes have a similar atmosphere. Child main-characters have to overcome dramatic events. Made in Abyss has an original abstract-like environment, the main-characters want to reach the bottom of a mysterious hole, filled with mysterious abstract-like creatures. Yakusoku no Neverland is about clever orphans, who try escaping from their ""home"", as they are only raised here as monster-food. Everyone tries to outsmart the others, their very lives depend on every single move. "
37779,1535,30,"Both shows are thrilling, keeping you hooked to the screen, they are about mind games, have genius characters, and have very good storyline. Everything is very detailed and explained wisely. Good psychological thrillers are rare today, these shows are unique here. 
Both are about battle of wits, two sides trying to outsmart each other..Promised Neverland is a spiritual successor of Death Note in shonen (jump) genre ... 
Both animes are full of mind games and psychological fights between protagonist(s) and antagonist(s) who struggle to outsmart each other. In both shows everything is portrayed in very detailed, good looking art. 
In terms of the psychological aspects, both are engaging and keep the watcher attentive.If you enjoy good back and forts using wits and an individuals location/environment, then this would be great.Would go more into thematic similarities but that is better save for each shows to reveal. 
The mind games taking place in the Promised Neverland are very reminiscent of Death Note 
Death Note and The Promised Neverland are both anime adaptations of Shonen Jump series that keep you on the edge of your seat with their clever mind games. 
- Great mind games battle.- Genius characters.- Characters trying to outsmart each other.- Unpredictable & unique. 
Both psychological thrillers- an air of mystery surrounds the show as characters try to outsmart each other and figure out what exactly is going on. There's elements of horror/gore to both as well, and a sense of time running out. Also, Death Note is just an incredible series in general!  
Smart characters playing mind games with eachother, you can really feel the similarities in writing even when watching the anime. 
Both have mindgames and have a lot of tension. If you like Yakusoku no Neverland, I'm sure you'll like Death Note! 
Both are mystery manga with a lot of mind games between highly intelligent characters. 
+Mind games between the characters.+Its a game of cat and mouse with the characters trying to outsmart each other.+Mysterious and for the most part unpredictable.+Dark and deep. 
Both animes have clever protagonists/characters. When watching The promised Neverland i couldn't help but get reminded to Death Note's mind games and how Light tries to outwit L and vise verca. In the promised Neverland the orphans (Norman & Ray in particular) try to outwit mama and the adults with their own plans. 
both shows have very smart characters trying to outsmart each otherBoth shows have horror elementsEpic mind game moments 
i think these both anime are similar because the thinking and plotting of  Light Yagami is similar to the characters of Yakuso no Neverland  
both having characters which have great iq, trying to outsmart each other. 
Battles of wits abound between two similarly brilliant sets of people. If you like watching characters try to outsmart each other by concocting plans and cunning schemes, then these shows are for you. Death Note pits the genius of two individuals against each other while Yakusoku no Neverland leans more heavily on teamwork and collaboration. 
Both are great cat and mouse chases with perfectly directed scenes, and both are from Shounen Jump titles. 
Psychological Warfare. Both anime are a great example of mind games and being one step ahead of your opponent. Death Note's warfare is very simple, yet entertaining, with two great minds battling out the other in hopes to achieve the fall of one another. The Promised Neverland, however, the mind games also expand out to trust concerns and 3rd party members going all out to achieve their goals. Though Light and L's rivalry is a fantastic watch, The Promised Neverland is a much more thrilling anime with twists if that is what your tastes are waiting for. 
Both have a similar cat and mouse game between the characters.  Always trying to outwit one another to become victorious.  The risk of losing your life if you lose the mind game is high in both anime. 
Both of these shows have that dark, psychological type feel to them 
I'm just surprised that this isn't brought up more often when talking about anime simmilar to Death Note as they both have:- a fast paced plot that requires your full attention in order to keep up,- lots of mind games between two equally intelligent sides, a true battle of wits,- many twists and turns that will keep you guessing,- incredibly well written and complex characters,- and an emotional ending that will (possibly) bring you to tears. 
They are both full of twists, suspenseful events, and mind-blowing thrillers. Both series are packed with deep mysteries and intriguing developments that keep you on the edge of your seat. 
Narratively speaking Yakusoku no Neverland feels like a spiritual successor to the information warfare and psychological thriller of Death Note. With its meticulously crafted mind games and mysteries it takes a different approach than other increasingly more common action focused Shonen Jump anime. 
Similar but less erratic and less vague. Involves lot of planning, scheming, and countering. Easier to catch on and more enjoyable with good balance of character depth and story progression. Has lesser thrill or on the edge moments but more psychological horror. The same skills are displayed by main characters and it doesn't take long to get hooked. 
The Promised Neverland (Yakusoku no Neverland) has similar thrill and mind games to Death Note. Both series are about two opposing forces that have to beat each other through mind games and tactical elements instead of battles. They also both ran in Weekly Shonen Jump, so they are both very similar in tone. 
Both of these anime are Dark Fantasy anime. Those who liked Death Note will easily fall in love with Promised Neverland. 
They both have characters that are very smart and are very strategical with their plans. These two anime will have you on the edge of your seat wondering what's going to happen next. 
Both have a similar story where the protagonist is extremely smart and both have a kind of cat and mouse chase story 
Amazing mind games, amazing stories, amazing characters. Both are so addictive that make you binge-watch them. "
37779,31043,21,"Surprised there aren't more people drawing connections between these two... Similar in terms of genre and tone (psychological suspense/thriller), in addition to overall visual style (initially thought they might have been the same studio). In terms of plot, both follow the travails of powerful children facing dark/sinister, still-more-powerful antagonists, which leads to the cat-and-mouse pacing of each episode. Prime differences would be in setting (""Boku dake...""/""Erased"" is more realistically grounded, despite the key plot device motivating the central arc of the story, vs. the futuristic sci-fi/fantasy world of ""Yakusoku...""/""Promised Neverland""), and protagonist focus (""Boku dake...""/""Erased"" largely centers on the perspective of one MC, vs. ""Yakusoku...""/""Promised Neverland"" following the three central kids with more of an ensemble approach at points). Beyond those points, they're both quality, anime-of-the-season type series! read more 
Young protagonist, same sort of seinen psychological drama. 
The Promised Neverland and Erased both focus on a group of young people faced with a very hard adult task. They're both thrillers that keep you on the edge of your seat. 
Both shows feature a fairly mature plot with kids taking on impossible odds. This may sound like most shonen however the unique thing about both shows is that there isn't much fighting at all. If you like watching shows were the young protagonist tries to outwit a much older antagonist and if you like stories with darker themes then these shows are for you.  
Both animes have a similarity in the circumstances of the main group of characters. They are pre-teen children working together to outwit adults and possibly save the lives of other fellow classmates/dormmates. Also, the Atmosphere surrounding the characters in both animes are eerie and they both have supernatural elements to a certain extent. 
Similar vibe of smart kids trying to solve issues bigger than themselves in a dark setting. Psychological aspect, and characters are similar.  
If you like rooting for a group of incredibly clever kids, trying to uncover a mystery in a world that may be grander than first expected, you're gonna love this one. Both shows will have you on the edge of your seat; whether you decide to watch it all in one go, or take it one episode at a time. Superb writing, plot twists, and a strong cast of protagonists & antagonists make for two really great anime that I'd definitely recommend watching! 
Both these show have kids as main characters, who are capable of extraordinary reasonings and are fighting against adult villains. 
These two anime are both similar in a number of ways. Firstly, they both have a dark overarching tone with aspects of psychological horror/thriller and threatening human antagonists. They also both have child protagonists with adults being the antagonists, although Boku dake ga Inai Machi focuses on one main protagonist whilst Yakusoku no Neverland has three protagonists with a fairly equal share of screen time. The art style is similar in both.One significant difference lies in the settings of these two stories; Boku...Machi is set in the real world despite having one fantastical element (being Satoru's 'revival' power), whilst Yakusoku no Neverland is set in an entirely fictional world with prominent fantastical elements, although these are not the main focus and do not have a large amount of screentime.Basically, if you enjoyed the tense drama of Boku...Machi then you'll most likely enjoy Yakusoku no Neverland. read more 
- The protagonists are all young (in fact are the same age).- Both show abuse (more so in Erased though).- Both have intense scenes where the main characters hit a block.- The protagonists are trying to save lives. 
both are mystery & psychological, similar enjoyment. 
Both are thrillers including kid characters. Both have questionably intelligent characters. Both have good production values and their own visual directing style. I personally really preferred TPN to Erased. 
The children's fight. The Promised Neverland and Erased follow children fighting to keep others around them alive.In TPN, Emma, Ray and Norman fall into the situation wherein constant mental fights are at play against the those around them who are controlled by the Demons. With Erased, Satoru is sent back to 1988 as a child, in his fight against fate, and the serial killer who had killed Kayo, one of his classmates.Using psychological elements as the main theme, TPN shows the mental games children must play to stay alive. Along with Erased, though more mystery-solving.    
The psychological terror shown in both shows, plus the fact that both have children remakably brave with outstanding minds is what makes this two series a must-watch. Both storys have a very strong impact on you. The Promised Neverland does not provide super natural powers, but instead, extremly smart kids. 
Both present an atmosphere of suspance and a thriller development. Both are short and self-contained. Two small masterpieces. 
Both are psychological thrillers in which kids are attempting to outsmart adults to save their lives. 
Both shows star children having to solve mysteries with unique supernatural ideas added in. If you enjoyed the feeling of suspense that one of these shows offered you will find something to appreciate in the other. 
Both is mystery anime and both is good. 
Both the shows came from the same genre i.e. psychological thriller. If you liked the promised Neverland then there is more likely a surity that you are going to like erased. Both the shows keep people's on the edge of their seat and indulge in people's guessing what's going to happen next. 
Both are thrilling and have heavy pressure Both anime op are nice to hearboth anime has some plot twistboth anime is to prevent killing 
Both have animes have a similar way of storytelling and as a sucker for psychology animes with good plots you'll definitely like them! "
37779,13125,14,"Both are truly impressive and thought provoking. Unusual characters, unusual plot, unexpected plot twists. Similar setting, very similar atmosphere. Happy childhood, which turns out to be only a facade, behind which lies a terrible truth. 
The first episode gives the same impression, innocent children in happy peaceful world with boundaries not to be crossed, just to discover that their lives are not as dreamy as they thought. 
Similar type of horror, mystery and dystopian setting masked as a utopia. 
Both anime's feature very well written characters going through adolescence, and use supernatural themes/elements to further express their narratives. Both being done by A-1 Pictures/Clover Works, they both share many aesthetic similarities like art style, soundtrack, and emotional tones. Both shows greatly share all of the similarities previously mentioned; the shows showcase the growth of its characters, as well as express their emotions, by being combated by other worldly occurrences at young ages. Being able to convey emotion through characters is a main aspect of both shows, and something A-1 pictures has done for years. 
Similarities:* AMAZING way horror and thriller is executed in an anime. Honestly, horror does not really go well with anime all the time, but these two are exceptions!* Interesting mind games of outwitting opponents* Dark twist compared to the preface 
The atmosphere these two anime give of is very similar. At first you get to see happy children playing around until the darkness hits you and it turns into a thrilling mystery with supernatural horror elements. Both are about the children finding out the truth of the world they are living in. 
The premise: at a first glance, both worlds seem perfect, when they are, in fact, wicked.Both of the illusions are being protected by the adults (which after a while offer the kids a collaboration treatry).After finding out the truth of the worlds they live in, the children face lots of life & death challenges. The series also illustrates the psychological growth of its characters. 
Both set in a dystopian fantasy. Both revolve around children finding out secrets about their society. 
Children community, surrounded by mysteries and a forbidden-to-cross barrier. 
Both shows involve a group of children who cross boundaries they were never meant to cross, which leads them to learn about the true reality behind their world 
Both are coming of age stories set in the future. The young protagonists of both shows learn that the world they know isn't all to it and the outside world is dark and dangerous. Both shows start off shrouded in mystery and cheery but become pretty dark and complicated later on. Both shows are very exciting and are very good shows. If you like either of them, I highly recommend trying out the other as they are pretty similar! 
Same eerie vibe; similar premise; world-building is 10/10; characters fit well with the theme of the story. 
Both anime have good start with happiness but later on things just went south after they discovered something. 
Both have a dystopian society with disappearing children and mysteries to uncover. The more the anime progresses, the more we get an insight into what is actually happening. Both are also coming-of-age stories and feature a group of adolescents that grow up through several different events and time periods.   "

Both main characters face demons who had eaten their loved ones and both want to save what's precious to them. Although Demon slayer gives off more action and adventure than the promised neverland, the promised neverland is a very interesting and entertaining anime with unexpectedness crawling at every corner. Demon slayer is about a boy whose whole family was killed by a demon and only his sister was spared, but his sister had undergo a transformation into a demon, his job is to now revenge his sister; to kill the ultimate demon that slayed his family and to find a way to turn his sister back into a human. A story about sibling love, character development and many different types of fighting arts, with adventure and the peaceful rest of demons. read more 
Both anime are about children whose life become different after knowing that demons are always lurking around and harming humans. The children in Kimetsu no Yaiba and Yakusoku no Neverland are determined to banish evil demons and bring peace back to humanity. 
Something terrible happens in the beginnings of both of these anime's. ( People dying) Differences are just running away and fighting. 
To me its pretty similar to The promised neverland because its based around tweens because if you think about it there really not that old.  And also there similar because tanjiro is like emma because he would do anything to protect their family.(Ok, im pretty sure almost everyone has watched this but i just have to reccomend cuz its awesome) One more thing it also includes demons so if ya like that- 
Similarities:- Demons and Humans killing each other because they can't coexist in the same world.- The main cast are underage minors (11-16 years old) and a trio (Group of 3).- They kill demons and put on a disguise to survive.- Shounen tropes like ALMOST DIED moments, crying in the first episode, making new friends and enemies along the way.- Cannibalism and Social Hierarchy in demons.- They are fighting for a noble cause: making the world peaceful again by killing demons.- They met 2 good demons (1 female and 1 male) that helped them with their goal early on in their journey. For ""The Promised Neverland"" it's Mujika and Sonju. For ""Demon Slayer"" it's Lady Tamayo and Yushiro.- Everything that happens is explained afterwards, usually in flashbacks.Differences:- The Promised Neverland is set in the far future (2045-2047).- Demon Slayer is set in the past, Taisho Era (1912-1926).- TPN: The first story arc is about the main cast planning an escape from Gracefield House.- DS: The first story arc is about the protagonist training with his mentor to become a Demon Slayer. read more "

Both have extremely talented children who far surpass the capabilities of your average child which opens them up to more dangerous side of the world that your average child would never see, as well the exposure to added danger it also gives them a great opportunity to explore parts of the world your average person isn't even aware exists.Both shows have great senses of adventure and dark tones. "

TPN takes on the same kind of idea but on a smaller scale with the highly intelligible children of Grace Field having to save themselves from the bleak future that awaits them if they are too late.Both are good anime for the shounen demographic which are based upon using the brain for fighting against enemies. TPN is more psychological than Dr Stone, however. read more

37779,1575,2,"It is deadly chess... Basically if you make one mistake you die. The longer you hide what you kow, the more likely it is for you to survive. I strongly recommend both of them for the tension :) 
Mind games commence. The Promised Neverland and Code Geass knows no bounds with mind games, both anime follow seemingly physically weak protagonists fight against the dangers that overpower their world through mind games, and combined strength teams can make.Code Geass has Lelouch rebel against Britannia for their tyrannical reign, while TPN has the Grace Field children fight survive the mysterious creatures that control from behind.Both are great anime with awesome mind games from all parties involved. "
37779,6114,2,"Both series includes being locked in a certain place and the characters attempts to escape from there. Though in Rainbow it doesn't include supernatural beings like Demons. 
Both shows have hard-hitting drama and a story about companionship blossoming in the face of corrupt authority and the hardships such bonds can bring. Rainbow:Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin is a more conventional character drama with a thriller undertone and some historical elements whereas Yakusoku no Neverland is a psychological-horror thriller through and through with more ""targeted"" drama and supporting mystery elements. If you grew attached to the characters in Neverland I suspect Rainbow will be right up your alley and vice versa if you enjoyed the beginning of Rainbow the most Neverland will not disappoint you. "
12355,35851,21,"This is the top recommendation already, but the themes and emotions in these two movies are both really raw and similar. Single mothers raising children that are of a different species, dealing with the problems that arise because of these circumstance, and loving their children unconditionally. Both movies made me cry, though Maquia had me in tears since minute 10 til the end of the movie. They are really heart-wrenching movies, and as a girl who immigrated to America and lost a lot of familial bonds, I cried a little extra. The pure maternal love in these movies make me choke up every time. Really recommend them.  read more 
Motherhood: the movie. These are two stories of single mothers raising a child/children by themselves. They are some of the best examples of true motherly love, and really hit at that emotional core in many ways. They show the sacrifices required to raise children, and both the good and bad that can come with that. If you want something to lift your spirits, likely through tears, these two are easy to recommend.  
Those are movies about a single mom raising a child from a different species. In the case of Ookami Kodomo, the protagonist raises her two half-wolves kids; in the case of Maquia, the protagonist raises a human boy as if he was her own child. Those are one of the few anime I've ever seen that focus on how hard it is to be a single mom. Both are great movies, and will surely make you cry. 
- A story about mother.- Hana is a breeder , Maquia not. Both are lovely mother to have, though. And to watch ofc.- Two rebellious kids v. one mother-complex kid. Choose your poison wisely, mom.- Beautiful world. Personally, i like the kindgom-esque world in Maquia more than the humble village-esque world of Ookami Komodo.- There will be tears. Trust me. 
Both are films about motherhood, under unusual (that is to say supernatural) circumstances, that will likely make you cry.Despite their fantastical setting, they focus on the hardships of life, relationships, and how people change and grow. 
Both are very beautiful films. They make me cry T ^ T. Similarity:-About single parents-Show how mothers care for their children grow patiently- A BROKEN HEART MOVIE T^T 
need something that wants to test how tough your heart and emotions are? I will give thisP.S : this is an anime movie, so it doesn't take long time to watch it. 
Both have similar themes.Both will make you cry. 
SPOILER ALERT FOR MAQUIAMaquia and Wolf Children both deal with the hardships, struggle, love and care through the fantasy genre of mothership and maternal love. Where as Wolf Children's conflict comes through Hana having to raise 2 impossible children who possess both human and wolf traits, Maquia shows the relationship between an immortal girl raising a child who is inherently not her own. Both seem almost majestic by showing what is essentially at its core a grounded and heart felt relationship between mother and children, with the struggles of growing up, yet also being set in a believable fantasy world. If you love Wolf Children, or want a realistic fantasy to cry at again, you owe it to yourself to see Maquia. read more 
Exploring the themes of motherhood integrated into beautiful fantasy settings. The focus on parenting is more prominent in Wolf Children, with Maquia expending more time and effort to develop its world. Both are dazzling and dramatic experiences to behold, ambitiously attempting to weave tales covering large time spans within just a few hours. 
-Both of these movies made me call up my mum and just say ""I love you so much and thank you so much for looking after me and loving me <3""-They are heart-warming and beautiful and twine together all the emotions felt by the viewers seamlessly-TELL YOUR MOM THAT YOU LOVE HER ! 
Both are hearthwarming portrays of a mother raising her child through adversity 
Wow, both will have Cat's In The Cradle playing in the background as you watch them.Apart from being blatant pro-natal propaganda, both shows take a huge risk that other producers avoid like the plague - talkin abt MOTHERHOOD.In case you didn't know, its one of the hardest jobs in the world and both movies prove that in their own way - by chopping onions on the down low. Still, the only thing you have to remember is CALL YOUR MOM AND TELL HER YOU LOVE HER DAMMIT!!! 
I think the biggest similarity between these two movies is that they’re parent-oriented tear jerkers. If you’re looking for a grogeous movie to sob to, look no further. The lead in both is a single mom trying her darn best for her kid (s). Sayonara is a fantasy based worl that includes dragons, mythical races, kings and warring kingdoms, while wolf children focuses on a modern Japanese setting. There’s strong character growth through both, which includes the children and the parents. You’ll cry for both, so get the tissues ready. 
Both tackle the same topic which is raising a family. Although that both have fantasy, Wolf children is more connected to the modern era. They have a similar narrative with the use of timeskips, and in my opinion they were better used in WC. If you enjoyed one of them, I highly recommend the other 
It's no easy task to become a good parent, especially being a single parent, Wolf Children and Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms are specialists in this situation. Even with the vast difference in race, even with the abnormalities and troubles that can be brought to the family due to society. Mothers Maquia and Hana both create a family far from a standard human one, in which, both protagonists go through a process of learning normal life skills via raising children. Both characters also have a nice smile to keep up.Both are great works for the fantasy genre about family, though Promised Flower is for those who love drama, Wolf Children for those who look for more s.o.l read more 
It would be hard to find two movies more similar than these two. They both feature:- single mothers raising a child of a different species,- themes about your children growing up and you having to let them go,- lots of emotional moments to cry at,- and a beautiful fantasy setting. 
They are both movies about a mother's struggles of raising their children and family life. 
The protagonists of both movies are extremely similar, in a sense of having a child yet not knowing on what and how to deal with it. Teaching a valuable lesson in life that might help in real life situations if the same issue/s were encountered.

Both stories revolve around a single parent attempting to find a way to raise a child/children on their own and the trials and tribulations that follow. 
Both show the struggles of being a single parent caring for children. They are slice-of-life anime that are really really heartwarming. 
They both are simple stories about life. While ookami has a plot in the last 1/3, Usagi Drop continues to have the simple tale. That doesn't mean they both are bad, since they don't have plots. It's actually their simplicity that makes it so engaging. They both heavily emphasize about how cutesy both animes are suppose to be and we grow with the characters. they are both fun and have magnificent storytelling that makes the characters extremely gratifying. 
Both are the only shows in existence about parenting  worthwhile. Just please don't read the usagi drop manga. 
Both anime contain a main character that take cares of kids with him/her self, and both of them had much trouble to get use of taking care of children. 
Parents make all sorts of sacrifices to raise their children. These sacrifices are compounded for single parents. The reward of seeing their children grow is quite motivating. Both are centred around such stories and are told from the parent's point of view.The artwork and sound track to both are absolutely great.Usagi Drop has a much more happy and light feeling to it where as Ookami Kodomo no Ame to Yuki has one of the saddest openings ever and a bittersweet ending, especially if you are a parent. 
Single-parenting with extraordinary circumstances. 
They are both about the idea of growing up; being raised by a parent until they are capable of being independent. The animation style for both titles are very simple but bright, and their ost, in my opinion, sound very similar at times. Although Ookami Kodomo no Ame To Yuki is about raising wolf-children, rather than human-children, both anime have the same feeling to them while watching; the viewer could even feel accustomed to the idea that raising animals as their own children is perfectly normal, making both titles, naturally, a relaxing watch. 
Both about raising a child alone with one of the parents is missing and both have the same aura 
Similarity- point difficulty of single mum/dad that have to raise kid aloneDifference- Ookami (movie) is a lot more struggling because the mother has to raise her two werewolves kid in human world alone since they were born.  
Usagi Drop and Wolf Children are both masterpieces about the difficulties of raising a child. Both have unique artwork, exceptional characters and stories, and while Usagi Drop is more simplistic and easy to follow, it's an anime that doesn't get enough credit! So, if you loved Wolf Children, WATCH IT! "
12355,523,11,"Both have families moving into an old vacant house in rural areas. They have funny and childishness moments that have supernatural aspects to it. Not to mention both are movies and have absolutely wonderful and beautiful animation.    
Fantasy feel.  Parent moving out to an old home in the countryside with their two young children (very similar scenes here). 
Both movies have a beautiful mix of slice of life and fantasy with a heavy focus on a single (or acting as a single) parent caring for two adventerous children in a rural mountain village. Ookami Kodomo can definitely be compared to Miyazaki's works and feels to me like a modern-day Totoro. 
Both concern the coming of age theme in it and the characters' move to the country to live in a traditional japanese house that is hidden away from neighbors. Also Young Yuki reminded me a lot of Mei, both having very similar personalities. I got the same heart warming feeling watching both of these movies 
Nothing is explicitly similar about these two movies, but they both have a slice-of-life type of feel and a very calming atmosphere, as the characters are isolated in the country for most of the movie. They both deal with the relationship between humans and nature, and feature two adorable children being raised by one parent. However, some (minor) differences to note are that Wolf Children revolves more around the mom, rather than the children,while Totoro focuses on the children. Wolf children is also sadder and more emotional than Totoro. 
The plot of both movies takes place in a rural area of Japan and both talk about childhood with fantasy elements. 
Two of the greatest anime films, both brimming with magic and wonderful understated moments. They never get too dark, so both provide a healthy dose of family-friendly entertainment. 
Both of these movies have similar themes of family and growing up. Totoro is more geared towards kids while Wolf Children appeals to adults more (specifically parents). This also means that Totoro is more lighthearted and fun while Wolf Children is somewhat on the serious side, although it still has plenty of funny/cute moments. These two movies also have similar settings, featuring a parent with two kids in a house near the forest. The soundtracks are very different, but both sound great and really help boost the impact of important scenes. I would also say that these two movies are the best animated movies of their respective decades. read more 
They have a similar narrative: Rural life and family with supernatural touches. Both are highly recommended.  
They feel very much alike, both being about some familial issues and giving off this hopeful and very soothing atmosphere. 
What the countryside brings. Rather than a similar plot, both My Neighbor Totoro and Wolf Children both follow a family moving out to the countryside.Whilst My Neighbor Totoro does this at the very start of the movie, Wolf Children does this due to the pressure from other people in raising Wolf Children.Both are good interesting anime with My Neighbor Totoro being a wholesome adventure. Wolf Children being more dramatic. "
12355,28805,9,"Clear parallels between growing up as someone who doesn't belong with a focus on choosing your own path.Also... you know ;) 
Both anime films directed by Mamoru Hosoda deal with a world based on our world with some supernatural beast-like elements.The biggest similarity is both are movies that deal with parenthood and children growing up and coming into their own. Wolf Children is more about a mother and her two kids while Boy and the Beast is about a son and his father.Both are solid movie experiences and are donely fairly well. I think parents are more likely to get a kick out of them but I can see many enjoying their stories. 
- Both are animal-human stories, but wolf children is a little more dramatic.- Similar satisfatory feeling with the animation / Plot. 
Both anime movies are directed by Mamoru Hosada.They have similar art style and animation.  Both have beasts and animals that can talk, so interaction between humans and animals/beasts. Great and heartwarming story, very detailed and with lots of action. Definitely will keep you entertained.   
First of all, both movies are written/directed by the same guy so the art styles are very similar. The Boy and The Beast and Wolf Children are both very similar. They both involve a human having some sort of relationship with a beast. They're both heartwarming and both span over a long period of time. Although, Boy and the Beast has more action in it and, in my opinion, is funnier than Wolf Children in terms of comedy.  
Same production, same animation, same torrent of feelings : both touching as hell . The two stories are really different, but every elements that made Ookami Kodomo a good movie are also in Bakemono no Ko . Be sure you watch it if you liked this movie 
Difference- Ookami will lead you to see how amazing for someone to become single-mother- Bakemono is like fulfill each other missing pieces and pull out inner strength to do sth 
Unique upbringing. Wolf Children and The Boy and The Beast both follow children raised by parents with a unique biological factor between the two relations.Wolf Children's human mother Hana has to raise two literal half-wolf/human children. Boy and Beast follows human Ren entering the beast realm, only to grow onto Kumatetsu as a disciple of his.Both are great movies made by the same studio, Studio Chizu, and the same director, Mamoru Hosoda. 
How the single parent feels when raising their kids, and vice versa?Both movies give some kind of sense of that question. They give an answer about how a man or a woman become a single parent (not because they have been forced into). Both also give the same perspective from the ""kid"" char. "
12355,4181,8,"Both have similar topics. When a person losses someone they loved and have to raise their childrens on their own. Extremily poweful and heartbreaking. Cute childrens ( ushio, ame) that have sad stories on their own. Both have a fantasy but intead of making the story boring and unrealistic, make it more powerful.If you like it, you will definetly like the other. 
Similar emphases on family and both leave you with a similar satisfying feeling. Plenty of drama, heartbreak, and a little comedy to make these slice of life stories about families growing up some of the best anime there are. Clannad After Story has more romance and much more drama while Wolf Children has more emphasis on the kids growing up and discovering who they want to be. 
Both involve a parent raising their child (or children in Wolf Children) whilst overcoming their own personal issues. It's difficult to say exactly how similar the two situations are without giving huge spoilers, but they're pretty similar.Also, both series have a fantastic soundtrack and incredible animation, and they're both extremely emotional watches. Chances are that one or another might make you shed a tear at some point. And if you were left with somewhat of a void after watching either CAS or WC, one of these will probably fill it.(Bear in mind, though, that if you're going to watch After Story, it might be an idea to watch Clannad's first series first). read more 
Everyone takes away something different when watching a series. When I think I found a new favourite, I really ask myself, what was so great about what I just watched? What about it moved me so much? I ask myself that of Clannad: After Story (CAS) and Ookami Kodomo no Ame to Yuki (OK).CAS and OK have very sad and poignant moments. OK has the saddest opening I've seen to date. CAS made me cry at the end. Without revealing the plot, tragedy strikes and the story telling is very well done in both.Raising a child has its ups and downs and this is well captured in both. There is the ineffable cuteness of a child, the difficulties of raising one and finally the satisfaction of seeing them grow. This aspect is well captured in the narratives and you really get to share in the emotions of parenthood.So, if you watched one and felt really emotionally moved by the sad moments and parenting, you will no doubt enjoy the other. read more 
Both anime have a heavy focus on real-life struggles, though with a bit of magic sprinkled within the plot. They're also massive tearjerkers with somewhat ambiguous endings, though Wolf Children's is less controversial. And finally, both of them are about learning to continue hoping and carry on, even in the darkest of moments - wonderful art pieces of inspiration and love. 
An even more powerful, even more pure, beautiful film about parenting and romance. Clannad: After Story has the emotions, Ookami Kodomo No Ame to Yuki has it too. Both are Slice of Life genre. Clannad and Clannad AS are both about family and children, so is Ookami Kodomo No Ame to Yuki. Both are at times funny, romantic, sad, tragic and joyous. Both are highly recommended. 
Both have similiar topics the importance of family and the struggles of adulthood.Also both have a fantastic soundtrack and incredible animation and they're both extremely emotional scenes.If you like it,you will definetly like the other 
One of the hardest things in the world can be raising a child. It only makes it worse when said person is struggling with life already as it is. These statements are well presented in the stories Clannad After Story and Wolf Children.The struggling parents Tomoya and Hana go through a majority of ups and downs in their seemingly lives full of despair. And whilst they go through parenthood, they too, proceed on a path to go over new lessons in what being a parent means.Both are great visual pieces with heartfelt moments around every corner of the movie. "
12355,32281,5,"-Same Story telling styles-Amazing Soundtracks-Gorgeous animation-Emotional Stories 
Easily two of the most heartfelt stories to be released in the past decade. With honest characterization and light fantasy/sci-fi elements, these stories are able to tell extremely deep, memorable, and emotional experiences that few other films can rival.  
Maybe time can separate people. Maybe backgrounds can separate people. For a few that is the case. For Your Name and Wolf Children, that is not the case. Even with the differences in where people come from, or the literal boundaries time has on us. Both stories go to show that even these circumstances can be defeated.Your Name is the odd relationship of Mitsuha and Taki as they go through inescapable body switches, and how that draws them together. Wolf Children is about Hana’s relationship with the anomalies of literal Wolf Children.Both are great movies with amazing visuals, and elements of supernatural in both of them read more 
Stunning in visuals, story line and overall production value, if you enjoyed Your Name, you'll love Wolf Children. Each film tells a beautiful story, with great aesthetic and design value along with it.

12355,10408,3,"Both deal with romance with the supernatural. Although Ookami is more on what happens after the romance, the two share the same ambiance. Both stories are lighthearted and simple, but deliver relatively strong emotions. 
A girl fall in love with a mysterious and lonely boy that is indeed not a human (werewolf/youkai).When she discovers his secret she still decides to stay by his side.Love wins, but with there will be consequences...Very good animations and sad-romance feels in both films. 
In both, the protagonist is in love (romantic and motherly) with a supernatural being. Also the overall atmospheres are alike. "
12355,33352,3,"Both of these anime have very different story, but what I find similar is that protagonists are involved in an incident that affects their feelings and lives. So they end up having to learn a lot from life, get mature,  understand their feelings better and let go of things that troubles them most.Both have a nice story, breath taking animation and emotional scenes. 
Loss. Violet Evergarden and Wolf Children both follow female protagonists with someone they had lost someone special along the way in their lives. From this point, both protagonists begin to teach themselves and understand how this new view on the world works without the help of their dear ones.Violet Evergarden is the journey of Violet and her solo quest in finding the meaning to the Major's ""I love you"". Wolf Children is the single mother Hana and raising literal wolf children.Both are great visual works about growing to understand what life throws at you. 
It has the similar vibe and environment. "

Beast and man. Whilst having varying plots, Princess Mononoke and Wolf Children both have similar ideas when it comes to the relationship between man and animals.Princess Mononoke takes a more pessimistic view which shows the constant conflict between the two races. Whereas, Wolf Children is much more optimistic though it uses half-half beings in a family with humans.Both are great visual masterpieces about the two sides relationships between man and animals can bring, being the good side and the dark side. "

Yes. The genders are reversed (DO NOT WANT MALE HOWO--NO!) from S&W's pairing but that matters not when the movie is about half wolf, half human children coming to terms with life.

Except, it does flashback on the memories of the main character's without tragedy yet filled with madness and anger about his (Arima, Kousei) mother forcing him to be a prodigy (spoiler alert *sorry* T~T)-Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso's setting is on a modernized era and is taking place on schools in Japan while in Violet Evergarden, it takes place on around 1800s or 1900s wherein it is more likely American or European due to their names (?). read more 
Both are very emotional, moving animes that can bring tears to your eyes. Both animes address the ideas of love and how emotions make us human which is very beautiful in its own right.  Both have similar art styles and as a bonus, both have fantastic soundtracks as well! 
Both focus on the beauty and tragedy of love and loss with stunning visuals, beautiful soundtracks, and artistic atmosphere. 
Beautiful artwork, and so much feels! 
-Both deal with a concept of ""reaching someone""-Both deal with self-discovery; finding a piece of yourself that you lost/never had-Both have the main, underlying themes of love and loss 
Literally a torrent of emotions ... For those who like it, these are must-watch. For others, I recommend also if only for drawing and animation. And such beautiful soundtrack can only help... 
Hello <https://myanimelist.net/profile/King_Korubi>Hei! I've been thinking to recommend you emotionally drama here, Please don't miss Violet Evergarden because it will be shaking your heart a little bit. you will drown in your emotional in this anime. overall it will good to see, and you will have no regret.  
It is just as heart-warming and pure as 'Violet Evergarden'. It carries a similar theme of love although Violet Evergarden is tend to set differently in an older era and much more beautiful themes.  
Both are extremely touching shows and have beautiful visuials and sound 
you r gonna cry in both 
Both are sad anime dramas.Violet Evergarden might start out as one of your not-so-funny slice of life anime, but when THOSE episodes come, it will sure bring a tear to your eye. "
33352,28851,10,"Very beautiful, personal stories of growth, self-discovery, and overcoming your past trauma. Top quality animation and art, fantastic directing, excellent soundtracks. These are two of the most personal feeling anime I have ever watched. Lots of great emotion and drama. If you want something to break and then fix your heart, these two are some of the best. Bring tissues. 
Both utilise disability as an inhibitor of mental health and the understanding of feelingsThey explore the meaning of living, both physically and mentally, and highlight the importance of friendships and connections. Although they are set in completely different times, they centralise on the development of human emotion and understanding of circumstance, the effect of history and righting the past. 
-Beautiful art -Beautiful music-Both are full of emotions-Similar storytelling 
Having watched this show I come to think that these 2 shows had a same vibe. The weight of loss, the dramatic and well animated story, the good casting of voice actors. If you were moved by one of those you will very likely appreciate the other. In addition they both feature a disability of their own. I highly recommend that if you liked either of those try the other one. You won't regret it. 
Shows a very sad story of heartbroken girls and how they try to change for the better both make you want to cry at the end  
Similarities:-Beautiful art style-Simple and concise plot-Excellent character design-Fluid animation-a Slice of Life-Great pacingOverall, both programs are extremely well rounded and can be watched by anyone who genuinely enjoys the art, animation, pacing, plot, and characters portrayed in anime. However, these two anime can be emotionally exhausting and really provokes empathy towards the viewer for the characters. I wouldn't be surprised if you cried while watching to either one of these anime (Watch episode 10 of Violet Evergarden and see). I highly recommend these two programs to any avid anime watcher and I assure you that these are definitely worth your investment in time to watch.  read more 
Koe no Katachi is a beautiful piece of art. That's just a basic irrefutable fact. The thing is though, art is something that is continually refined and evolves to become even better over time. Violet Evergarden is a prime example of this. Violet Evergarden has the perfect balance of a great, simple, story and also being visually appealing. By far, Violet Evergarden has the best animation I have ever seen. Both of these shows have great stories, and they tie it all together through the use of art to create a masterpiece.  
-100% will make you cry-great animation -aesthetic 
They both are beautiful animes and are both emotional, I would recommend watching these with tissues and snacks. 
okay so since a bunch of people of people have already made this recommendation, i doubt too many people will get around to reading this but oh well.to be completely honest, the stories don't have much in common other than trying to make the audience cry (which isn't really a bad thing). however, the reason i think of one of these anime when the other is mentioned is THE ART!!! the art is exactly the same!! the same style of drawing face shapes and movements, and most of all the closeups!! since i know many people (including myself) watched violet evergarden because of the strikingly beautiful art style, A Silent Voice has the exact same art style!! (i believe they have the same ""Key Animator"")so yeah, if you like the art of one, watch the other!! hope i helped :)) read more "
33352,35851,8,"These are both stories of love and loss, and give off the same warm feeling (coated with a splash of darkness). Both main characters are trying to discover what love is (in various ways), and trying to find their place in a world that doesn't really want them around. The art in both is fantastic, as is the music. Characters are also fleshed out and enjoyable. Bring tissues, these are two emotional roller-coasters you won't want to skip. 
- Both give similar feelings and bring alike atmosphere. - Both will probably make you cry. - Protagonists don't fit in society due to being different from most people, and animes focus a lot on their personal development. - Kind bittersweet story. - Both main heroines are blond, duh.  
Both main characters are detached from the norms of society due to their past upbringings, and go through quite a bit of characterization and development as their respective story progresses. In both cases, they were bittersweet and show the hardships and realities of life, even in fantastical settings (though Sayonara no Asa is more supernatural/magical by nature).Both shows' animation are among the best in the recent years, and arguably ahead of their time. 
Both anime have similar bitter-sweet atmosphere, telling a story of girls who doesn't fit into society and how they learn about the world as well as how to overcome obstacles on their way. Both tales are very emotional and more likely will make you cry at some point.  
There is a very simile feel between these two. They both have female mane characters and have a bitter sweat story about people struggling with there emotions and coming to grips with what has happened in there past. Also the artwork in both these show is amazing, the overall feel of the show is smiler as well despite the fact that violet evergarden is light fantasy at best. 
Both SayoAsa and Violet are linked to one thing: character development as an important narrative element. This is the reason to watch, you want to see the characters being alive in the work. 
Conflict is bad. But with its destruction it brings, the aftermath that comes after it can sure change one's life forever long. This is true for both Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms and Violet Evergarden.Both heroines Violet and Maquia suffered from confliction between two different groups, only to distance away from the troubles and live a new life finding meaning in what should be an obvious answer to a simple question. That is, being a mother in Promised Flower, and what ""I love you"" means in VE.Both are great visual masterpieces filled with heartfelt emotions and amazing soundtracks to accompany it. 
-Both Can make You Cry--Both are about learning emotions and who you are--In my opinion they both have an amazing message in the end- "
33352,4081,6,"yes both of them have a different plot and view. but they do have one similarity and that is how they tell us a heart warming story. 
Violet Evergarden and Natsume Yuujinchou both follow abused and neglected protagonists, who find their place in a cast of colorful characters and learn to embrace the beauty of the world around them. For Natsume, this is by learning to accept both the human and youkai aspects of his life and cherish them both; for Violet, this is by learning the value of emotions, and the complexities of human relationships. Both are shows about healing, and both follow a sort of ""one-shot"" structure, where the main plot of each episode isn't always intrinsically related to the other episodes.  
Both series have the formula of tackling a specific character per episode.The magic of both lies in the power of the viewer sympathizing for that character in a mere 22 minutes. Ranges from heart-warming to straight up sadness 
Both had the same vibes. Both are ""episodic"" series. Both MCs have been outcasts in their pasts 
Tales of pain and sadness told by the others. And by this, over the time, the main character that had undergone their own agonizing past came to see a new perspective of their life, and started to understand their own emotions through those experiences on each its episode.  
both lead is a lonerBoth lead characters face new person/character each episode and try to help them. Violet help by writing letter, Natsume help by releasing them(spirit). "
33352,4181,6,"Violet Evergarden is the return of KyoAni's glorious heartfelt and grounded Storytelling sense Clannad, more specifically AFTERSTORY:-they both are animated by the same Company KyoAni-both have grounded emotional weight in its story-follows the story of an extremely empathetic lead with troubled past seeking some form of redemption and/or consolation in life.-taps into complex emotions and experiences that permeate throughout its narrative.-has an episodic pacing to its shows structure for ease of watching.-are known for exposing viewers emotions into physical manifestation more commonly known as Tears. 
If you loved Clannad: After Story, Violet Evergarden is for sure the next anime you would like to watch. Violet Evergarden is also produced by Kyoto Animation, one of my favorite studios. It has one of the best animations I've ever, beautiful soundtrack, and tells heartbreaking stories just like Clannad does. It just has 13 episodes, so there's no excuse to not watch it. Give it a chance, I'm sure you won't regret it! 
Well, both are just beautiful tear-jerking anime with amazing plot and development that hit you right in the feels big time. 
kyoAniMusicFeels all the wayLove TearsLove and Love 
Both are made by the same production team, Kyoto Animation, and hence they managed to bring out the emotions to the highest level, giving both anime a sad and beautiful story to cry to.These two anime are the only ones that I managed to relate in spiritual level and to shed tears to. Romance, comedy and realistic human interaction at its finest. 
Constantly searching for a meaning of something is difficult. Clannad After Story and Violet Evergarden are no exception to this standard.MCs Tomoya and Violet proceed on a long trek in finding their meanings relevant to their lives, whether that be about the people closed to you or what love is. On such tedious journeys, our MCs find answers to why things in life are the way that they are.Both are great s.o.l anime full of drama, both brought to you by Kyoto Animation "
33352,486,5,"Young girl travels around the world and interracts with various people, learning their stories and maybe helping them. Both girsl also scarcely shows emotions, have military experience and can defend themselves without a problem, thought their look might suggest otherwise. 
Both are episodic shows with leads who don't show much emotion, the draw of both shows is the episodic person/place they go to and the story that results from that, and both are more atmospheric than story driven. Kino's Journey is just more philosophical while Violet Evergarden is more emotions based.  
Both shows focus on the protagonist visiting various people, and learning about their customs, as well as helping them deal with problems 
Stories of two young individuals traveling vaguely historical, vaguely fantastical worlds, viewing the best and worst in people, all while showing very little emotion. Both beautiful meditations on how mankind interacts with each other, and how beautiful and terrible that can be.  
While each of these two anime have a vastly different tone, they both share similar themes. Both feature stoic female main characters who, after many episodic scenarios, grow as a person and influence the people they meet. "
33352,32281,5,"Both Violet Evergarden and  Kimi no Na wa featured realistic art and emotional scenes. 
Beautiful art.Like Shinkai's works, Violet Evergarden also has hyper-realistic animation, beautiful attention to detail, and the lighting is just gorgeous. Although their plots and views are different, they share the same emotional, tear-jerking, yet heartwarming style of storytelling that leaves the viewer satisfied yet yearning for more. 
If you're looking for great backgrounds, a nice soundtrack, fantastic animation and a moving story, this is your way to go. While Violet Evergarden and Kimi no Na wa. have rather different scenarios, they're equally well made, and definitely are two anime you will remember. 
Beautiful visuals and music 
Wholesome Romance Drama "
33352,35839,4,"Both series are largely about dealing with the loss of a loved one in various ways. They are about the main characters discovering who they are and what they want to do in this world. These stories are heartwarming and heartbreaking. The characters are great, and the adventures they go on motivate you to get out and do something with your life. I enjoyed both greatly for largely similar reasons, mostly the atmosphere, the stories, and the characters. 
Both are an EMOTIONAL ride from heartbreaking scenes to moments for tears of joy.Both display LOVE in a special way that make you cry.Both are MAGICAL throughout the entire show.Both have STUNNING art and OST.If you like Violet Evergarden, you will like A Place Further Than the Universe and vice versa. 
same aesthetic and will both make you seriously rethink your life. both inspirational! 
Now this, this si something. Where Violet Evergarden focuses on Violet's sad journey to learn empathy, A Place Further Than The Universe focuses a little more on the heartwarming aspect of our four characters' journey towards their respective goals. The characters have some of the best chemistry I've seen in anime. And, you might ask, in what way is it similar to Violet Evergarden ? Well, if you're looking for something that hits in the feels and inspires you into doing something you wouldn't usually do or changing your perception of the world a little bit, here is what's perfect for you. "
33352,9989,4,"I find both shows very sad. They both easily get people to cry. They are both sad but in a good way. When watching Violet Evergarden I constantly got Anohana vibes! 
They're both very emotional and amazing. 
Both are emotional and they each talk about how loss or things that have happened in your past can take an effect on your identity and future.  
both are tearjerkers available in netflix "
33352,12355,3,"Both of these anime have very different story, but what I find similar is that protagonists are involved in an incident that affects their feelings and lives. So they end up having to learn a lot from life, get mature,  understand their feelings better and let go of things that troubles them most.Both have a nice story, breath taking animation and emotional scenes. 
Loss. Violet Evergarden and Wolf Children both follow female protagonists with someone they had lost someone special along the way in their lives. From this point, both protagonists begin to teach themselves and understand how this new view on the world works without the help of their dear ones.Violet Evergarden is the journey of Violet and her solo quest in finding the meaning to the Major's ""I love you"". Wolf Children is the single mother Hana and raising literal wolf children.Both are great visual works about growing to understand what life throws at you. 
It has the similar vibe and environment. "
33352,31646,2,"The tears I felt watching both of these kept happening whether I wanted to or not. Both explore deeper themes of life and self much more than something like a tragic romance 
Both emotional stories which involve characters who learn more about themselves through challenges, loving surroundings and such "
33352,39533,2,"Both talk about loss and a journey to try to be full again and recovering 
I think all fans of Violet Evergarden will enjoy Given. The themes of love, longing, and moving on are apparent in both shows. They manage to communicate the themes of love coming in many different forms through unique means. Two main characters in both of these shows are strikingly similar, and the openings and endings are also deeply moving and tell a story in their own right. If you want another short, yet everlasting story, please consider giving Given a chance. "
33352,19,2,"These two animes show you what a human is. Both have amazing soundtracks that are perfect according to scenes. These animes teaches you the meaning of life, beauty, innocence, kindness and many other important facts about humanity. 10/10 for both animes. Recommended for those who understands. 
Exploring lives and characters. maybe they're not that similar.. but I just really felt like recommending it, because i liked both for this reason, or.. it was one of the reasons. "
33352,5114,2,"Violet evergarden has an anchorage similar to fullmetal alchemist, remembered in ancient europe, besides both protagonists lose their arms, and have a warlike climate throughout history, I highly recommend. 
This might seem like an odd recommendation, but I believe both Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood and Violet Evergarden have a lot of similar story elements and themes, with the main difference being that FMA:B is an action-adventure series and Violet Evergarden is a drama.Both series take place in a quasi-steampunk world based on early 20th century Europe, in the aftermath of a devastating war. Many characters in both series struggle to find meaning in their lives after the war is over, and there is a strong undercurrent of loss and redemption. Both series have incredible animation and music, strong character development, great action (although Violet's action is much less prominent in the story), and lots of tear-jerking moments. And to top it off, main characters Edward and Violet both have blonde hair and mechanical limbs.If you love FMA for the fights and fantastical elements, you might want to check out another shonen series like Hunter x Hunter or Shingeki no Kyojin (Attack on Titan). But if you love FMA's deep themes and character drama, you should absolutely give Violet Evergarden a shot. You won't regret it. read more "
37987,28851,1,Is still the best KyoAni movie since this one has an actual solid ending and a point at the end 
1535,1575,548,"This seems to be a pretty common comparison - probably because Light and Lelouch are practically the same character.  Both shows feature quite a bit more intellectual sparring than your typical shounen fare, and both main characters have very similar personalities (they're closer to being villains than heroes) and abilities (ridiculously powerful but with prominent weaknesses that require careful planning to circumvent).   
Lots of thinking involved, and the main character exploits a 'magical power' to try to change the world. 
Genius's with a special power using their brain strategising and  planning. Light and Lelouch have similar ideals and try to change the world in the name of justice but acts more like the villain 
Two student who get a power and use it to rid the world of evil, but it slowly takes them over. Both shows are very similar, and Light = Lelouch. 
both the main characters' wish is to change the world with their own hands..plus the two main characters shares almost the same attitudes...plus the flow of the story too..it's kinda the same~ 
Main Characters have the same kind of intentions. Both are smart and use good strategies/tactics, very interesting. Main characters both have interesting powers. 
Both anime are like a chess game. Very strategic and different from what you've seen before. 
The two opposing protagonists in each series fights for what they believe is true justice. 
It's kind of like Death Note with mechs and lots of big bosomed girls.  It has some of the same sort of premise that Death Note does, and some of the same atmosphere, but it takes itself a lot less seriously.  It also plays out less like a thriller, but it has some of the same sort of cat and mouse element that Death Note has.  You might not like Code Geass, but there are enough similarities that you probably should give it a shot.   
The situation is totally different, but in both the main character is very sharp and uses his brain all the time. Though in Death Note the main character had to fight other mastermind, in Code Geass he had to defeat a whole empire.Both of them will make you want more. 
Code Geass has more or less the same idea as Death Note, the ally of justice, but a ""zero"" instead of ""kira"" and some mind work here and there. the differences are: Code Geass is more colourful+humorous, the protagonist is more emotional and less clever when compared to light. 
The series are both about 1 person that gets a power to do good things, but some people think it isnt good what they does, some people do. (In death note, the killing of criminals, and in Code Geass he wants that the 11's can be called Japanese again) They have both a friend, who's on the 'battlefield' an enemy.(sorry if my english isnt good) 
The main characters of both shows are remarkably similar. The only significant differences are that Lelouch, unlike Light, has more reasoning behind his actions than simple boredom and Lelouch cares about more people than just himself. If you've watched Death Note first you'll half expect Lelouch to start screaming about becoming the God of the new world.The series themselves are quite different. Death Note is set in our world, where as Code Geass is set in an alternate universe where Britannia rules most of the world. Code Geass has bright colours, comedy and ecchi, Death Note does not. However, there really aren't many anime with characters quite like Light and Lelouch, and the similarities they share are more than enough reason for a fan of one to like the other. read more 
Very similar plot. A boy who gets the power to make anyone do what he wants and use it to change the world they live in. Both very interesting with unique characters (except maybe for suzaku). ""The bad guy"" in the main character position, everyone against him. 
The plot of Light/ Kira (Ryoko) vs. Lelouch/ Zero (C.C.), with same smart cold (evil in a way) main character with an abnormal power who uses it to change the world to a better place from his own point of view for justice 
In both series there is someone trying to make a better world with help from something special. Death Note has it's notebook and in Code Geass there is the Geass. 
Although Code Geass might involve a few mechas, it bares a strong resemblance to Death Note, they both include a main character who is a genius and who has just acquired a supernatural power which they wish to use to reform the world into their ideal. So if you enjoyed Death Note you might also want to check out Code Geass. 
Both Kira(Light) and Zero(Lelouch) want to create a new world. L and Suzaku are against their methods of creating this new world. The only difference is that Light is idealist, while Lelouch is realist. And L is realist, Suzaku an idealist.  
Rather similar theme of both main characters trying to create a better world via their manipulative alter ego's. Both characters also start out with good intentions, but start to lose their own ideals along the way and become more out of control. 
Code Geass is similar to Death Note in how they deal with morality issues such one's justice.  They both play mind games with their enemies expect Code Geass is more of that of the military nature.  The main characters in both uses mostly anyone they could as their pawn in order to achieve their victory.  
Well, they are both awesome for one, the protagonists are similar, they think alike I guess, And the cliffhangers...I thought I'd die from watching these -_- I think the main similarity is the characters and what they hope to achieve - World Domination (sorta) and the animes are about how they go about that. 
Both protagonists have their lives changed dramatically when they encounter a being who gives them strange powers, and they both use their power to pursue their ideals. 
The similarity here is quite obvious. Hyper-smart main characters are bestowed with a special power, which they then make use of to change the world to their liking, through plotting, planning and strategy. 
Quite similar. Although the main characters have diferent objectives, they both want to rule the world, and also have the 'master-mind' needed to do that. If you liked Death Note, watch Code Geass; and if you liked Code Geass, watch Death Note! 
The main characters of these series gain a power to control/kill people and they want to change the world. 
Despite how Code Geass has mechas and intense action scenes, both of these series both have a highly intellegent main character given a special gift/power that is used to turn the tide of the world.  While Death Note may have more clever ideas and less action, Code Geass still has a great main character full of ambition and has some of the most exciting mecha action there is.  When it comes down to it, you can't help but appreciate the brilliant minds of Light Yagami and Lelouch, and if you liked one,you'll probably like the other. 
Code Geass and Death Note are similar to each other in a way that they make the viewers (watchers) think of who is really justice and the like. They are both intelligent animes. If you like Death Note, I guess you'll also like Code Geass, and vice versa. 
Both of main character obtain a power that will change the world. Not only that, both of main character is very intelligent,dare to make risky move that usual people don't want to. 
Code Geass and Death Note were pretty much like each other, in my opinion at least. Death Note was too dark for my taste, whereas Code Geass has somewhat similar plot and the main character isn't so evil at all, at least not until the very end, and even that is debatable. However, Code Geass isn't as deeply intellectual series as Death Note. So, if you liked one of these, you might really like the other one too. 
The two main characters have the same twisted mind frame, using strategy to kill in order to create a ""new and better world."" 
In both animes the main character - an ordinary boy in the beginning - gets super-powers and decides to change the world by very cruel and remorseless means. 
The anime differs much. But when it comes to the main characters, they have alot in common. They both have that so called unique way of thinking, not to mention how smart both are. And they might also have the same goal. 
Light and Lelouch have similar personality and demeanor with different motives and methods.Light wants to create a world where there is no crime, with the us of the DeathNote he began killing criminals with unforgivable crimes.While Leouch got the Geass which he uses along with his intellect to undermine and eventually crush an Empire.Both the characters through-out the series face rivals which challenge their intellect and wit to the limits. 
probably the only similarity is few characteristics of the main character. Light Yagami and Lelouch are secretively trying to destroy the bad guys (criminals in DN and ruthless Britannia empire in CG). Similar to how Light keeps fighting L, Near, Mello by using various strategies, Lelouch has to deal with his best friend, who is empire's servant in a similar way except that CG's setting is in a future where Robots (controlled by humans) do the fighting. I don't want to go in further details, but let me assure you that if you liked DN, you will also like CG for sure. 
When I finished Death Note, I was going through such bad withdrawal that I needed to find another anime that was similar to watch.Code Geass did it for me. Although I think it's not as thrilling and suspenseful as Death Note, it definitely has my thumbs up. The story idea of a character having the power to change the world is similar. The setting, fighting, and etc. are different. Actually, I think Code Geass has more action than Death Note since it deals a bit with the military and stuff.So, if you like Death Note and you like guns and fighting, I'd say go for Code Geass. It helped me through my Death Note withdrawal, and I hope it can do the same for you! read more 
Lead roles are quite similar: both are given a rather limited superpower, and decide to create a better world with it. Cat and mouse mindgames ensue with the rest of the world, where both sides use underhanded tactics to gain victory. 
Both portagonists want to make a better world using a supernatural power, both are very intelligent and both will do anything to achieve their objectives. 
Lelouch Lamperouge and Yagami Light share some characteristics. They both want too change the world at all cost. Not a single death is too much for them. Although there are no Mecha's in Death Note, and no Shinigami's in Code Geass, I am sure that if you liked the one, you will like the other, so jump into the lives of these Anti-Heroes, and see what they will do for their goals! 
Both of the main characters, Light and Lelouch, are very intelligent, and consistently demonstrate their abilities throughout each of their respective series. If you liked that cleverness from Death Note, you will definitely enjoy Code Geass. 
main characters are extremely similar. both receive a power that allows them to control others. both have generally good intentions but have extreme ways to achieve that goal. right from the first episode i couldn't help but think this guy is just like Light. 
This anime has the perfect ""death note"" feel to it... the main character thinks almost the same way light does and hopes to accomplish a somewhat similar goal... only through different means. although its very similar to death note it has far more action and far more characters that play an important role in the store. shame there is no ""L"" like character in code though.... 
Code Geass is similar to Death Note in that Lelouch can kill people with out touching them or make them do what ever he wants.  
Both Code Geass and Death Note follow the stories of ingenious and charismatic young men who gain a special power.  Both characters use their new power to attempt to change the world. Both animes are full of suspense and twists! 
I realized how similar these two animes are right from the first episode, both have amazing character personalities, great animation and both make you watch more and more even though you should be doing something else... 
From the general idea behind both shows, to subtle details, Code Geass IS Death Note, but with mechs. Seeing as how Death Note was first and also, in my opinion, easily the better of the two shows, Code Geass can be considered a Death Note-ripoff. If you like exotic character design and giant robots, you may enjoy Code Geass more, but overall, Death Note does a much better job of telling the story of a young man who gains a supernatural power and wishes to improve society through controversial means. Death Note is more thought-provoking while Code Geass emphasizes the typical shounen aspects more. 
Both main characters have a limited amount of power to control other peoples mind / life span. Even tho the main characters are similar, code geass has alot of mecha action while death note has barely any action. But both of them are still great! 
Just like everyone else says, the main characters, Light and Lelouch, are similar in their genius minds and willpower to change the world. Not only that but both of the stories unfolded quite well and were unpredictable till the end. 
Geass is something like Death Note. Both main characters (who have a strong sense of justice) come into possession of that mysterious power, which allows them to change the world. They have comrade-in-arms, who gave them that ability (C.C. and Ryuuk). So both Lelouch (under the alias Zero) and Light (under the alias Kira) start a mind game and wage war against that rotten world, which should be destroyed and rebuilded again as a better place. 
Both series focus on a character that could be seen as either good or evil; A character who is trying to usurp the current rulers and set himself at the top. Also, both Lelouch and Light are tactical geniuses, both have an almost psychopathic and egotistical side, but all the while they are very good at keeping up a calm and collected facade in front of other people. Finally, both possess something of supernatural power that allows them to get ahead in the game quickly, but may or may not be their downfall in the end.Both are tales of Revolution. 
There is good action but that is not what i think it is all about.  It is more the psychological aspect that is really interesting.  There is more action in code geass - hangyaku no lelouch but i think that the death note has a more detailed story line. 
The animation styles are very different. Code Geass may look lighter or happier, but both anime deal with dark themes of control, death, judgment, and power.While Death Note takes place in our world, Code Geass takes place in a sort of alternate history based world with Mecha, a complex political situation, and a dystopian landscape in Japan.In both cases a very intelligent character who is seemingly normal otherwise, is suddenly presented with a supernatural power and the choice of what to do with it. Both decide to use their new found power to change the world for, in their opinion, the better; but, not everyone feels the use of such power is ethical, or, agrees how to make the world better, and the characters face opposition. In Death Note the conflicts are much closer, as they do not involve international politics or battles, they are more centered on the minds of the two main protagonists. Code Geass involves much of the same chess style psychological battling, but, applies it to the grand stage of world power struggles as well as character driven motivations. Both anime feature plot twists and a sense of unpredictability, if you enjoyed one, you will likely enjoy the other, though, they are different in many ways and should not be watched with expectations of intense similarity.Code Geass is concluded in the season season, Code Geass r2 read more 
The main characters are both ""evil"" masterminds behind a plot to save the world. They both acquire a supernatural power and use it to their full potential, c.c. is like ryuk. and Lelouch's geass is like Light's death note. Both have friends on the enemy's side that are unaware of their identity. Code Geass is a little more childish and unrealistic, but if you enjoyed the intellectual Death Note you can't miss this anime! 
Both feature similar protagionists and both series have a more thinking and suspense style to it then it does with action scenes. The primary difference between the two is that Code Geass involves politics and warfare where as Death Note is more based on crime and detective work. 
Death Note and Code Geass's plot are very similar. The main characters in both anime created a name for themselves such as Zero and Kira. Both of them keep their faces hidden and want to uphold justice. 
Its has almost the same main character and have the same problem for the mainthat he goes against the community and try to destroy/ change the world.they both use some sored of mystical power and uses it on many people (for light its the death note, for lelouch its the giass). 
They are bot similar to each other, the stuggle between ""good"" and ""evil"". The two masterminds Yagami Light and Lelouch Lamperouge have similarities on how they want the world to be and to bow before them...  
Both deal with a man who obtains a mysterious power and use it to improve the world and rid it of their definitions of evil 
Main characters are very similar, both are manipulative and sharp/shrewd, as they try to think their way out of their situation, using this the powers they're given. 
the main characters seem to be the anatagonists rather than protagonists... and they often, if not sometimes, become ""berserk"" with what power they have! and they're both bishies >///< also the stories both feature are somewhat inlolving death 0.oand both series have good soundtracks =]]] 
Both are great shows, with main characters wanting to change the goal, there are similiarities in the main characters actions however they are still two entirely different people and different shows but most people who like one end up like the other show 
if you love yagami light in Death Note then you'll love Lelouchboth of them are main chacters who try to fix the world where people can live happily and to prevail justiceusing the special powers and abilities they are given, Lelouch and Light can be less different  
Through out the whole series just like in death note it makes your mind go crazy they are are both mind thrillers and makes you think of what outcomes could happen to the characters. 
RUN! RUN! SOMEBODY IS KILLING EVERYBODY! Is it right? Is it wrong? You figure it out while watching this! Its amazing how 1 person can change the world with just a little determinating, hard work, and magical powers. Your in for a treat. 
They both include two boys with a special power trying to change the world through that power, all the while trying to hide their real identities. 
Both have very complex stories about justifying their worlds. 
Take some concepts from Death Note, and add in a lot of mecha action. Both have main characters who want to change the world. Very interesting.  
Both have main characters that want change in the world and use various powers and strategy to obtain their goals. 
Both main characters Kira and Zero have special power-not psychical but this ability can change the world if used properly. In exchange for this ability they had to sign a contract. They both want to change the world and both are genius. 
A young high school student suddenly gains a mysterious and frightful power from a strange being. Testing, measuring, and finally executing their new abilities, along with all the peril and impacts on the human race, is the journey shared in these two shows. 
Both gain a supernatural power and wish to change the world with their new found power and ideals. 
This two animes are very similar.. with unguessable plots which may even give you a suprise.. Death note has Raito the main character who is very good with tactical strategies like Code Geass's Lelouch.. Both anime rocks.. lol.// 
Twisted lead protagonist in both series, where both don’t really care about others lives and look to use others to gain something. Both lead characters have exclusively a strange power in Code Geass it’s the power of ultimate Command for Lelouch and Death Note Kira has his this mystical book. Both series have friends that oppose each other and look to kill each other, and have a sort of tragic romance to them as well. Both are dark animes to some extent especially Death note. 
Both anime have the main character who wants to change the world for the better, and are very smart although Code Geass is for those that would also like some action, as there are a lot of fights with mecha, where Death Note is more supernatural.Death Note has wits and planned tactics, whereas Code Geass uses more strategy and is smart in a more military way. 
They both have the same evil protagonist deal.  Both Light and Lelouch have a power to help them get whatever they please.  However, Light's Death Note is a little more broad, allowing him to kill people without even meeting them, while Lelouch's geass makes him have to look at the person directly in the eye.Light has a manipulative type of personality once he picked up the Death Note, and when Lelouch got his Geass, he acquired this same type of hidden personality.  Both stories widen out with different antagonists and all sorts of different conflict.They are very interesting overall. 
If your a Code Geass fan you should love Death Note as I feel they are both similar character wise. In both, the main character gets a power to assist them in changing the world for the better in their views from a party whom follows them for the duration of the series. While doing so, they both gain followers who support their ideals. While this happens, a force attempt to fight the main character and discover their true identity.Both resemble a game of chess as the main character fights to knock out all obsticles in their way to have their ideas reality. 
The stories of Code Geass and Death Note are similar in many ways. First of all, the main characters of both series want to take over the world by using the powers that they were given. Both Geass and Death Note are used to give people orders, but the power of the Death Note always results in death. Both series are ones that keep you hooked till the last episode in my opinion, and in Code Geass' case, it leaves you with many unanswered questions. 
They are both powerful, destructful, and Evil anime i have ever seen. Code Geassis more destructive and more tactics. The turn arounds in Code Geass are unbelievable. Death Note will just blow your mind out from inside and out. The strategies that goes against eachother are simply amazing. They both rock my socks. 
The characters and morals are near identical. Both use a power to take over the world and the people in it. Both main characters names begin with ""L"". Both fight for the weak, the good and ""justice"" which for both is an argueable concept in both worlds. The only difference is that Mechs are much more prevalentin Code Geass then in the Death Note universe. 
Both anime are based around geniuses that obtain the power to change the world, and do so. It's very entertaining to watch how the plot plays out as their enemies of equal intelligence battle it out in a battle of tactical and strategical thinking. Both are great anime, and are my top two favorite anime. 
Its quite obvius why are those two similar. They both have strategic games between a studant with big ideals. 
Light ""Kira"" Yagami and Lelouch ""Zero"" Lamperouge are very similar characters. Both of them have genius intellects, a supernatural ability with very specific limitations, and a desire to change the world under a false name.In terms of differences, Code Geass is more fast-paced, and since it is set in a world with giant robots, there are plenty of large-scale action scenes - Lelouch's strategic genius is always pivotal here. It does, however, has fewer mindgames than Death Note - there is no L figure, though there is an ""Athrun Zala figure"".Lelouch is less fully evil than Light, with more clear motivations for his acts. Interestingly, he regards himself as a monster while Light regards himself as above morality. read more 
The main characters are very similar, both are really smart guys, they hide his real identity, both have an extraordinary and supernatural power given by a powerful entity, and have a really ambitious goal. 
Lelouch is like a more just and less egotistical Kira from Death Note. C.C. is his Ryuk. It's a great series and, unlike Death Note, the ending is satisfying. 
In death note, you have light yagami; an excellant star student who is bored out of his mind. he finds a notebook that kills people when you write their name in it, with it he trys to rid the world of all evil. In code geass:lelouch of the rebellion, you have lelouch lamperouge;an intelligent student, who wants to make a world where his little sister, nanally can find happiness. He recieves a power from a girl named C.C, a power called geass; he uses this power to destory his fathers, the emperor of the holy brittanian empire. 
Death Note's main character has a similar power to the Code Geass main character.Both of the main character's enemies have a different sense of justice, (Suzaku and L). And...both of the main characters do alot of planning, thinking and have a great strategic mind. 
Both feature anti-hero main characters who are brilliant strategists. However, Code Geass is more action-oriented, whereas Death Note is more cerebral.  
It has many of the same themes as Death Note, and Light's method of creating the new world is, while much more drastic, similar to Lelouch's morals-- to get what you want, you have to bloody your hands a little.  
Both series have a villain/anti-hero protagonist with a supernatural power to control people in some limited way, and a hero/anti-villain antagonist.  The protagonists are friends with the antagonists, and the antagonists' goal is to uncover the faceless, nameless alter-ego of the protagonist.  The protagonists are also pitted against their families.  Both shows make frequent use of miniature climaxes to go with short and simple story arcs.To begin with, Light and Lelouch are the same character with two exceptions: Light is athletic but Lelouch is not, and they have polar ideologies.  The comparison is endless between the two and includes several spoilers, so I won't go into it, but even most of the major events that happen to the characters are the same.  The important thing is that Light wants nothing but justice even at the cost of freedom, and Lelouch is vice versa. read more 
The two anime resemble each other with the main character obtains an abnormal power that could help him to change the world. In both anime, the main characters use this power to achieve good intention, but in Code Geass, the goal is for other's goods while in in Death Note, the goal is for the main charater's own good. So, you can experience a different view of using power in Death Note, and you can still feel the intense of the plot which is created from the battle between people with amazing deduction and persuasive arguments. 
If you liked see Yagami Light trying to be the new World God. You will love to see Lelouch Lamprouge trying to conquer the World 
While Light can kill people by writing names on the death note, Lelouch can control the mind of anyone with only visual contact.Both has as protagonists the ""villain"" of the story. 
Lelouch from Code Geass and Yagami Light from Death Note are similar characters. They both obtain a certain power and they both attempt to reshape the world with it to make it as they believe it should be. 
In both of the series, there's is one main character who's very smart and tries to change the wordl in it's own way.something what Death Note doesn't have, is that Code Geass is more about the main characters private life as well, and Death Note isn't. But if you don't like transformer like robots, than this might not be as good as Death Note, but still, try it.   
Although the enviroment and setting of both are quite different the stories are a bit the same. Both main characters recieve a power and use this to change the world. They both are really cool, but I myself prefer Death Note.  
Both have anti- heroes. Have a smart person trying to change the world. If you liked one, you will probably like the other 
Character wise there extremely simmilar, Lelouch and light the egotistical protaganists of the series along with Schniezel and L the masterminds trying to thwart their plans.Both are simmilar plotwise with both Lelouch and Light wanting the world to bow before them, with a justfull cause in mind but questionable methods of achieving this ideal world.anyways if you liked Deathnote go out there and watch Geass. 
The plot of the stories are completely different but the simularties between the characters Yagami Light and Lamperouge Lelouch are uncanny as they are ordinary students untill they come into contact with a supernatural power that they use to change the world in the name of justic they are both incredibly intelligent and both hide there identities behind the masks of Zero and Kira. There rivals prove to be a difficult match but have or gain a close relationship with their enemies. 
Both Lelouch and Light want to change the world, and obtain a power that allows them to do this: with Lelouch the geass, and Light the Death Note. Lelouch and Light are both insanely smart, as well as manipulative. 
Both Series are about ""Good"" superheroes who try to make world a better place,though they have diffirent attitudes toward it.both Lelouch and Light have some inhuman mystical power and are masterminds,who try to change the whole world.both are a must see for any fan of anime. 
Both feature a protagonist who gets some supernatural power and uses it to take a strong stance against society, bending the rules to suit themselves and letting nothing get in their way. 
Both Main Characters are very strategic and smart. Although the stories  are very different ,there is a great deal of similarities such as powers which aid them to their goals. 
The main character, who wants to implement his vision of the world, systematically striving for success and finally ... You must see it 
Similar plot with tons of twists and great character development. Awesome strategy and crazy smart people. Also super powers involved; notebook in Death Note and Geass power in Code Geass.  
Both are like a chess game. Light and Lelouch have a magical power (Light - Death Note, Lelouch - Geass) and they both want to change the world; Light freeing the world of criminals, Lelouch wanting Area 11 to become Japan again. They both take on aliases to cover themselves (Lelouch - Zero, Light - Kira, but Light just accepts the alias). The two protagonists act more like an antagonist. Suzaku, Lelouch's rival, is more of a protagonist, and same goes for Lawliet, Light's rival. After Light and Lelouch gets the power, the people who gave him the power follows. There are also other users of the power the character has. So, basically, Code Geass is Death Note, but with mechas (Knightmares). read more 
Both series has a similar way trying to solve the problem that they have or what they want to do. They both have an artistic power they use and manipulate people. 
They both have main characters that are very similar: both are intelligent, cunning, a little bit twisted, and basically antihero. Both the main characters have acquired an exclusive power that they can use to fulfill their ideals, and they would use any means to do so.  
Both involve highly intelligent students who receive powers from supernatural figures in which they use to change the world. Both of these students possess an infamous alter ego to captivate the world with. 
Cute, intelligent guys trying to change the world. Both are dark series though but with very good story lines! 
Code Geass is like a hybrid of Death Note and Gundam if you ask me.  Lot's of mech action and a character who enjoys playing god with his newfound abilities.  Death Note and Code Geass both have main characters who possess a god complex.  They also have the power to change the world, and they both intend to use it to justify that end.  If you enjoyed Death Note, then it's quite possible you'd like Code Geass as well.  Unless you're the type who's not into mechs, I don't really see any other deterrent for you to watch this. 
Both anime are similar because both main characters plan to change the world and by doing this, they later turn into bad guys and not the good guys. They both have something that orders somemone to do a certain thing. 
Both have characters that are mad at the world in some way and wish to change it. They also both get a god-like power from a mysterious character as well as...well you wouldn't want me to spoil it for you now would you?  
Both series have the genius guy trying to make thing his way, both are very intelligent and intresting.The main character in both anime have a very particular/supernatural power. 
Both feature a protagonist that acquires a special power at the beginning and they both gain craving for more power. 
Both series involve intelligent characters given the ability to hand out what they consider ""justice"". 
They're both very similar in that the main characters are both very intelligent, and both do what they believe is just, even though the rest of the world begs to differ.The only major difference is that Code Geass has giant robots involved named Knightmares, as where Death Note does not. 
A very inteligent plot that will keep you waching and wanting for more. 
As many will tell you; the main character of either series may as well be the same person. Watch as a single teenage boy, unexpectedly gifted with a great power draws in followers and leads them in the name of justice; only to fulfill his own agenda. Changing the world is easy when you control life and death. 
B'cause it's about strategy.....and the main character wants to make a new world with their mystical power...... 
Death note and Code Geass both focus on the main protagonist being drove by idealistic ideas of the ""perfect"" world. Light Yagami and Lelouch Lamperouge also share similiar personality traits, however Lelouch's sense of justice is more justified then Light's. 
Light = Lelouch; they both are geniuses and they want to change the world, regardless of the methods. Both full of drama and suspense, both are dark. 
In both Code Geass and Death Note, an incredibly intelligent teenage boy seeks to change the world with a secret, hidden, absolute power that very few know about. They differ in that Code Geass is much funnier while Death Note is much more serious, and that Lelouch uses his power for good, while Light is generally more selfish, especially towards the end. If you like Death Note, you'll DEFINITELY like Code Geass, but the same is not necessarily true in reverse. I personally prefer Code Geass by a lot, but both are awesome. I watched both series in dubs. 
They both focus, in some way or another, in ""justice"". The desire to create a better world is one of the forces which make the two protagonists move forward, using any necessary means to accomplish their goals, both aided by some kind of mysterious supernatural power. 
Both have main chacters who use changing the world to make it just as an excuse to kill millions for their own petty reasons: for Light it's to relieve boredom and for Lelouche it's for revenge. They both also start off with only their wits and a godlike power along with a mysterious helper who gave them that power for some price. That godlike power also drives both of them a little insane. They both also would put their plans at risk only for the sake of saving thier little sister. Later they also both gain   a secret identity so they can lead a group to help them  conquer the world.That secret identity is focused on more in dn than in cg.  In dn the other charcters besides the primary protagonist and antagonist play a very small role and so often remain undeveloped and one dimentional. Lelouche is also by far a more human, sympathetic and complex character who often shows emotions such as love, guilt and compassion.  read more 
Main characters have a similar demeanor and there is the same theme of what is justice? The conflict between Lelouch and Suzaku is very similar to the conflict between Light and L. 
Death note is often praised for it's superb intellect and twisting plot, this is definitely also the case in code Geass. As for the main characters, both of them aren't your everyday hero. You'll know what i mean after you've watched them both. In short Code Geass has everything what Death note has except for these aspects: the atmosphere in code Geass is less dark than in Death note, Code Geass includes quite a bit of mecha action, the ending in CD is, in my personal opinion, better than DN's ending. 
they are bothe psychological genre. The main characters in both anime are stargetic and anticipated the enemy they are against moves. Both anime are intese and once you get into it you will be sitting on the edge of your seat 
smart man (with name start in L :P) that use a unique power given to him to ""solve"" morally ambiguous ""problem"" 
A highly intelligent, politically minded teenage boy (with a superiority complex) who feels a strong sence of injustice in the world is granted the 'power' to make a difference - it's up to the viewer to decide whether or not he's a hero or villian.Both have a government theme.Both feature cutesie, not to street-wise, female leads with complex backgrounds.Both anime's are pretty much a fantasy set up - mecha's and death gods are unlikey to come into our lives. ;) 
Despite what a lot of people seem to be saying on here, Lelouch and Light and completely different characters. It's pretty easy to see that if you've watched both animes. However, that being said, Code Geass reminded me of Death Note a lot within the first couple of episodes. Both series pose major questions of morality on good verses evil, whether or not the means justify the end, etc. While not as serious, Code Geass does manage to have an extremely serious ending though it didn't compare to the ending of Death Note. 
Basically the same protagonist cept the one in code geass is quite a lot less of a creepit has more explosions too x) 
As they both are about a boy (roughly the same age) who wishes to changed the world with a special power they obtained from somebody else. They manipulate countless people to form the world that they wish and both shows are very interesting. 
If you liked Death Note, you will love Code Geass. I really enjoyed Death Note, but was completely blown away by Code Geass. Both main characters gain the power to change the world, both are driven by their own goals and ideals, and both start a journey filled with twists and turns and the characters' own views of what justice truly is. 
The same way to think they are on the top of the world and rebelion against the wrong system that they live in, mental wars and brain utility to win and not just physical strength. 
Similar mastermind protagonists (each with a special ability which can change the world), schemes and plots are set up and the ending is almost identical.Though while Deathnote has the fantasy/fairytale touch to it, Code Geass is based on giant robots and capital wars. 
Both anime are very strategic anime and has the most unexpected plot turns I have ever seen. You never know what is going to happen next. There are many differences, like Code Geass has mecha that Death Note doesn't have, but if you liked one of these you will definitely like the other. In both anime you are unsure if you should side with the main character or not. Both main charachters in both anime try to make the world a better place, but are their methods correct? 
Alrighty, now I know the MAL public is probably sick and tired of reading the same recommendation over 200 times, but one more can't hurt, right?Well, let's take a look at the similarities:-The main characters are attempting to defeat a certain power without revealing their identity.-Chess is mentioned often.-Both main characters have a special power that helps them conceal their identity.-Both main characters have -supposedly- high IQ's.-Yaoi jokes are commonly made about both animes. 
Main characters are totally the same: confident, clever and arrogant; both have supernatural power, fight for some sort of Justice and hide their true identity. And both have to cooperate with a girl they don't want to.The series are very similar too, a little like a chess game, although CG is less serious. 
An ""anti hero"" works for the supposed good of the innocent and weak, but using unjust means to bring down evil. 
Good-looking, intelligent anti-hero with a god-complex and aided by a beautiful ally. Both are blessed with a power to control people, they both have this mission to cleanse the world from the clutches of evil even if they have to betray their love ones. 
Like in Death note, there is a idden criminal that is a genius and on the same time they are the main character.You will see that in both, you see very skilfull plans.I think you will like 
The main reason why Code Geass and Death Note are compared so often is Light's uncanny resemblance to Geass's Lelouch. Both gain an ability by accident(or by fate if you want to call it that) that can change the world. Both are very intelligent, witted, manipulative, and have a twisted sense of justice that they attempt to justify. The main difference is that Code Geass has mechs and is a bit more colorful while in Death Note, Light is a bit more clever and emotional.(The cleverness factor is up for debate, as many people will argue that Lelouch is more clever than Light)  Another important key difference is that while Light is a more overall emotional character, he has almost no emotional attachment whatsoever to any other human.(His father was minimal and ultimately just a pawn in his game) Lelouch, is just as manipulative as Light, but does show a bit more of a charasmatic nature and his unconditional love towards his sister in the beginning of the show illustrates that perfectly.Another bonus of Code Geass is that it's ending and second season is MUCH better and well done then Death Note's. Overall, If you like Death Note, then you are almost SURE to enjoy Code Geass. Geass has a bit more humor and action, may not be AS psychological, but it's pretty damn close. read more 
Both are psychological animes, both have protagonists that have goals that they try and get to through means some dislike, you either love or you hate both protagonists, and both have their own harem moments.  
They're both about a guy that seems evil that is trying to repair the world in thought-out, strategic steps. 
Both with the protagonist obtaining a power that can kill or manipulate people. They both attempt to achieve ""world peace"" while they hide their identities from their friends, family, and the world. 
Code geusshas a very similar idea to Deathnote, both great show have similar use of Psychology to portray there intentions. Both incorperate a secretive ability they use to create change, both got theres abilities from a person thats immortalish, both abilities have strings attached. Same things happen to the main character at the end of the series. Both eppin shows (must see's in my opinion) GOGOGO! 
Two shows about teen geniuses attempting to alter the world, for the better of course, even if that requires swimming across a river of blood. Both end beautifully, and even after seeing them both several times, they bring a joyful tear to my eye with the elegant finallies. 
They both have intelligent main characters which obtain some sort of strange power  from abnormal people or creatures. They also have enemies who tries to take them down and the main character both have a secret identity like  death note : light=kira                Code geasse: lelouch=Zero  
Both the main characters play the role of the ""evil"" and they conceal their identities using a pseudonym. 
There both students who are tired of the world they live in and they get a special power with whom they use to change the world. They both get known with a certain alias across the globe making them famous and their real identity is unknown. This anime is SO similar.. seriously if you liked death note and vice versa. WATCH BOTH. 
Lelouch (Code Geass ) and Light (Death Note) both want to change the world with their special powers. The animes have the same kind of ''chess games'' going on. 
Both Death Note and Code Geass are very morally ambiguous, and focus on a main character that obtains a supernatural ability and, with that ability, deliberately demonizes himself in order to remake the world into a better place. Both anime are heavily reliant on the strategic interactions between the protagonist and antagonists to provide tension and rising action; both anime are more intellectual than action-oriented. Both anime also have fairly high production values, and though that's not necessarily the point, it is a nice plus. 
In both  main characters are gaining super power. They're trying to make world a better place at all cost. Light is very similiar to Lelouche. Both are sharp, logically thinking students, and they have aspiration to be God, instead of being students. 
[Similarities]1) The main character are protagonists bent on changing the world. 2) Both are assoicated perhaps with a bit of politics or businesses.3) There are limitations and rules of the two tools used in both this anime (deathnote and Geass)4) The personality and the intentions of the two main characters, Lelouch and Light, are similar.5) Rating wise, the Code Geass story plot, enjoyment, and suspense equals that of Death note6) The characters had possession over supernatural devices. 
It's another psychological thriller where a young man with high ideals gains power to change the world, both just great anime. 
Another good anime(not the manga) it is pretty much death note with mecha which sounds very weird but it works. 
Genius guys trying to create a ideal world with some unworldly help~!!!  
-Similar protagonist: Lelouch is smart, deceptive, and cunning like Light. He also seeks to make the world a better place through questionable means. Lelouch, however, is much more human than the cold emotionless ""Kira,""and has his weaknesses, making him a much more relate-able character. -Characters in general better than in DN: for me, only L and his successors really stood out (well, Light did too, but I didn't like him -.-)-Story won't let you go! Awesome plot twists/cliffhangers at end of many episodes that leave you wanting moreUnderlying story, however, is very different. -CG: More focus on action/strategy. Didn't see any mecha in death note-CG has high school comedy, DN has a darker tone though both are pretty dark-DN: abuse of power= bad. CG: powerlessness = bad.Both are awesome!!  read more 
Both anime are quite awesome. There is a guy who is very intelligent and thinks carefully about every move which he makes to achieve something. There are supernatural powers and both anime include death. 
The main characters on both series have the same impact and the impression of being evil, also world domination is another common point. Also there are supernatural factors and cute supporting characters.. 
Both Code Geass and Death Note features main characters who want to create a ""more perfect"" world by using their abnormal powers and amazing intellect. Also, the main characters from these series have an ""arch rival"" who thinks their way of accomplishing his goals is injust.  
Both pyschological, mindfuckery with ideology being twisted and the ultimate question if the end justifies the means 
In both anime the main character has a very strong sense of justice and wants to put a stop to the evil in the world. Both are also extremely smart and intelligent when it comes to fulfilling their goals. They both obtain a supernatural power given to them by equally supernatural people. Lots of drama, strategics, action, and good looking characters (especially CG) make these anime a definite on my must watch list.  
Both have an intelligent Protagonist that must conquer the world. Both story's have a-lot of hidden tricks and surprises and they both seem to keep you at the edge of your seat. 
Both Death Note and Code Geass is about a teenager who wants to change the current world with the help of a mystical power they posses and learn how to controll as the series continues!  
Both deal with an anti hero who wants to rule the world. They both have extra abilities that puts them over their rivals. And they're insane. Enjoy 
Both anime shows a intellectual person with supernatural power, who wants to create a world based on his own sense of  justice. 
Both shows feature situations that are compared to a chess match. In both shows the main character is one of the most intelligent students in the world and receives a power that may change the world from an immortal being, they get followers to help them reaching their goals of changing the world. Both shows have similar stories from beginning to the end. 
These two series have similar protagonist: Both Light and Lelouch are extremely gifted students, and both receive a mysterious power from a benefactor who always stays nearby. However, Code Geass's Lelouch's problem is that in the year 2017 the Holy Britainnian Empire invaded Japan, and Lelouch aims to remove them from power in order to create a better world for his younger sister, Nunnally. Great cast.In my mind, Code Geass= Death Note and Gundam put in a blender.A great series for fans of both! 
I think death note and code geass are alike because they both surround a young male lead who has great logic skills. Both lelouch and light want to change the world for the better. Both also attain a power that can help them in doing so;lelouch the power of geass and light,the death note. 
A genius teenage boy acquires a special power that he uses to try and change the world. This part is incredibly similar, but the rest is fairly different. If you want another show with the same premise, by all means, watch the other one. The actual feel for the shows is quite different, however. Death Note feels much more mature and darker than Code Geass, and Code Geass puts more of an emphasis on fanservice and the harem aspect. I personally think Death Note is a lot better, but it just depends which kind of show is more for you. 
Code Geass and Death Note are both shows of cunning brilliance to be able to out-think your enemy. In both shows the main characters have to stay a step ahead of the enemy to keep from being exposed. 
Watching one you just have to think about how much these are similar. Both are about mastermind boys with superpowers trying to make the world better or how they think it would be better. 
By the way of strategy to overcome your opponents. 
Both main characters share the goal of wanting to change the world. Both shows have suspense, action, and violence. 
The plot for both anime are similar- Both want to create a new and better world but are unable to until they encounter someone(CG)/find a book(death note) and receive the an unbelievable power, one to control anyone(CG) and one to kill anyone(death note). Despite the similarities in these animes i found code geass to be more enjoyable. Code geass has a somewhat complex plot and is somewhat hard to understand and is only enjoyable if you actually understand what's happening but if you can understand. Also watch the second season of Code geass- way better than the first season MUST WATCH!!!!!! 
Very close type of mind game(even though death note is better in it) where main character have a super-natural power with some restriction. 
Both feature extremely resourceful protagonists who hope to make the world a better place, and who have the cunning to do it. Both feature the use of strategy as a central plot element. The difference is that Code Geass doesn't go downhill. 
Light is a smart kid, ridding the world of 'evil' as he increasingly gains power.  Power that was handed to him by a 'supernatural force'. Lelouch is doing he same thing, but for different reasons. A lot of suspense and strategy on both parts. It keeps you thinking. 
Both series have main characters with genius like intelligenceboth series are about making the ideal world - code geass is making the ideal world by rebelling against britania and death note is making the ideal world by killing all bad people in the world. 
Main characters are very similar, same basic story, both very dark, and both have a never ending fight for justice 
If you love death note, you will love code geass - hangyaku no lelouch AND code geass hangyaku no lelouch R2 which is the sequel. Both of the series uses logic, and understanding. IT is both about using brains to take over something or some place. Plus there is a HUGE amount of suspense as yo uwill find yourself glued to your computer screen trying to find out what happens next. but, code geass isn't as dark and mysterious as death note, so WATCH IT 
Both anime include a deep psychological plot where the protagonist tries to establish his goal in order to change the world. Also, both protagonists have similar character traits in the sense that they maintain a alter ago known to the world while they hide their true personal identities as students, and that they both will do practically anything to achieve their goal even if it means to kill the enemy with their unknown supernatural power. 
Both series follow a strong-minded protaganist who has their own sense of justice and wants to create a better world. They both attempt to achieve this through supernatural means that they have been gifted with. The main difference between the two is that Code Geass is a mecha anime, whereas Death Note isn't. 
These 2 series are a lot alike. Lelouch and Light both find an amazing power, have kinda the same goal, they are both geniuses. The main difference is that while Death Note refers to the current world, Code Geass takes place in the future. In my opinion, Code Geass is actually even more amazing as Death Note!!! 
People who enjoyed Death Note should absolutely, without-a-doubt watch Code Geass and vice versa. They are similar both in plot, character development, tone, and even philosophical merit; and anyone who thoroughly enjoyed one should love the other. Both deal with protagonists who are essentially megalomaniacs, obtaining otherworldly powers from a supernatural being, which they then use to change the world to their liking. Both are considered to be highly intelligent and excellent liars, employing these tools to defeat enemies who believe their rules and goals to be immoral or against the status quo. Both characters employ aliases which become known worldwide, rarely revealing themselves even to their allies. A central and interesting theme in both of these shows is the struggle between an equal but opposite force which is manifested by a close friend/ally/rival. The bond between the two forces is perhaps the greatest factor that propels both plots forward, literally and emotionally.Both series, while being fast-paced to the point of addictiveness, deal with complex psychological and philosophical issues: specifically, should one person have the power (or use the power) to change the world for the better, especially at the expense of others lives and freedom. Since both of the characters of megalomaniacs, it complicates the morality questions even further and makes for very compelling plots and character development. read more 
Both protagonists are seeking to rid the world of evil, though being slightly evil themselves. Through contracts of sort, both obtain supernatural powers (Lelouch = eye, Light = notebook). Through their overpowering intelligence, both are able to plan out very successful tactics to achieve their goals. The protagonists have to lead a double life as a student, and have to high their identities from their friends, family, etc. 
Both of the leading characters want to do good things, but are a bit evil. Both want to change the world and make it good, and they get special powers to achieve that goal. Both are a bit comedic sometimes but have a very mature and serious story. There's a good message in both too. I really recommend to watch them! 
Both series feature a man trying to change the world with only his intelligence and one special ability. They both also have the same... theatrical sense. 
These are very similar as others have noted in particular the lead character, the strategic thinking, trying to outwit the opponent and so on. In terms of differences (since there are so many similarities), death note is closer to the ""detective"" genre whereas Code Geass is science-fiction. 
Both teenagers who are ""superior"" to their peers, who get a power in which they both try to make a huge change to the world. The only difference is Light yagami from death note is morally wrong while lelouch from code geass is doing it for the morally right reasons 
The first half of death note plotwise is almost identical. Only difference is that code geass maintains this great plot, whereas death note fades  
Both are extremely clever and intriguing. Both main characters are geniuses and attempt to fight evil (the rest of the world). 
Both character in the anime are smart as they think a lot. People around them assume they are good, but really they are evil killing people that get in their way. 
In both animes, the story is about a protagonist who is fighting for what the believe in which renders on most part more towards the darker side (more villainous side than most protagonist). In Code Geass, Lelouch is very similar to Light were they side on the dark side but because of the unique stories it binds us to actually support these villainous roles as it is almost a form of justice. Also some psychological/mind games are involved in both animes. Definitely a must watch anime if you loved Death Note. 
They have similar lead characters (Light Yagami, L and Lelouch) who are intelligent. They both involve mindgames between adversaries. They are both excellently well-scripted anime with a mind-boggling element of slow revelation of plot. 
Code Geass is essentially Death Note. Replace Light with Lelouch, The Death Note with Geass, Ryuk with C.C. and add more action scenes in fighting Robots. However, one thing differs and that is how both characters react to each their powers. While Light immediately believes in achieving a god complex with his power, Lelouch uses his power for good until the power corrupts him and the people around him. In my opinion, Lelouch becomes a more interesting character this way and more likable than Light, and I trust me I do like Light. 
The main characters are very similar with strategic thinking and have both a longing for changing the world mostly to what they think is right. The main difference between them is that one is a genius psychopath who is generaly evil but the other one is evil for the greater good. 
Death Note and Code Geass were have similarities due to darker, older teen audiences, supernatural power, and fighting for justice. Here is the example for characters.Lelouch (Zero) = Light (Kira) - Both were main protagonists, using alter ego and persona, using supernatural weapon (Notebook for Kira and Geass power for Zero), going for justice, they are anti-heroes, and also has younger sister.Suzaku = L - Both were antagonists, support for main protagonist, and well as 2nd main protagonist.C.C. = Ryuk - Both were working for main protagonist, they're using a power and spell, and they love their favorite food (Pizza for C.C. and Apple for Ryuk).Kallen = Misa - Both were love with main protagonist and serve for main protagonist.Unfortunately, both anime were banned in China due to offensively, inappropriate,  and possibly strong mature rating. read more 
Both protagonists experience a twist in their personalities after a chance encounter. Although the concept of technology and shinigamis are different, both anime also have to do with the power of the eyes. Both anime have a sinister mood, and both are epic. 
Death Note and Code Geass are must see for all those people who just started watching anime because both of them are just masterpieces. These animes are not about fighting each other with fists, its about thinking about a way to win, using others to achieve your victory. 
They have similiar protagonists, who both are intelligent and trying to make the world better place by using strong methods. 
Both of there stories have a main character that is young but extremely intellegent. At first Light wants to rid the world of bad people, but becomes a psycho-maniac. As with Lelouch he only wants to gives his diabled younger sister a fair chance in life, but soon realizes he isn't the only one with a good reason to fight The Empire of Britannia, but still he has his crazy moments too. 
Code Geass and Death Note are both about a high school student who is out to change the world for the better by using a mysterious power. However, Code Geass is more about politics and discrimination, while Death Note which is about crime. They are both excellent shows. 
En ambas historias nos presentan protagonistas estudiantes de diecisiete años con una inteligencia y una habilidad para pensar envidiables. De parte de un ser misterioso reciben un extraño poder anormal, con el cual, usando maniobras friamente calculadas, planean cambiar al mundo como se lo conoce actualmente, ocultándole a todos quienes son en verdad utilizando un pseudónimo y desafiando a la ley si es necesario. Durante el desarrollo de las tramas se conoce a otros personajes con este poder, y estos pueden ser tanto compañeros como enemigos. Y a pesar de que ambos protagonistas demuestran ser personas frias y decididas, llega el momento en que muestran su lado humano y podemos conocer sus sentimientos más profundos. read more 
They both have guys who think they are doing the right thing but really they're hurting the people around them. Also Code Geass is a little bit hard to I dont know, umm understand at the start.If you liked one you'll like the other :) 
They both have an antagonist,or whoever believes he's doing the wrong thing, as the main character thinking of ways to rule the world and get the want. The only difference is that code geass is based on more futuristic things like robotic machines and such compared to just a notebook. 
Both shows feature young men and their ambitions to change their corrupt worlds through morally questionable means bestowed upon them by the supernatural. 
Well both have facts about life which are true. The main characters in both are doing something that they feel is right, but not everyone thinks that way. Both Lelouch and Light has a girl following them.  
These two animes are similar because of the main characters who share the same villianous qualities. They both seem to want to create a better world with their new powers that they required, the Death Note from Ryuk and the Geass from C.C.Light and Lelouch's  names both start with a L :P and they seem to be very intelligent, planning every attack by using their pawns precisely. Both of them have their own followers and share a tight bond with at least one of them, Light and Misa and Lelouch and Kallen.Also they both appear to have their identity a secret with only a handful of people knowing and use a God-like name to be known as, Kira being Light and Zero being Lelouch. read more 
They both tell the stories characters trying to reach a similar goal.Both of these characters (Lelouch and Raito) have a special power and many obstacles in their way.Both are extremely entertaining masterpieces. 
The main character, Lelouch, is like Light from Death Note, but better (AKA he's not an asshole). Both protagonists are antiheros, both gain a unique power, and both are clever, popular, manipulative schoolboys.The whole series shares some themes with Death Note; 'what is justice?', 'what means are morally acceptable in a fight for the common good?', 'If you had a power to change the world, how far would you go?'.The main difference would have to be that Lelouch actually has feelings for his friends and loved ones, whereas Light is willing to sacrifice anyone and everyone at the drop of the hat. In addition, Code Geass is a mecha anime with more humor, a brighter color scheme, and (very little) eechi. Death Note is a detective show with a subdued color scheme and very little comedy. Another notable difference is that Light is a idealist and Lelouch is a realist; and on the other side we have L as a realist and Suzaku as an idealist.They're both thought-provoking shows that have you on the line between supporting the main character and supporting the people trying to take them down. If you liked Death Note I think you would enjoy Code Geass, and vice versa. read more 
Both anime are rather similar-the difference is that Light wants to save the world because he thinks it's rotting, while Lelouch wants to save the world for his little sister.And if Kira=Zero, and and Sayu=Nunnaly, then it all evens out!  
The plot is the same the main characters are both evil but the see as justice the both get powers in death note the guy get's a DEATH NOTE in Code Geass the guy get's a eye technique with both powers they kill the enemies and other people that is their justice. 
It concerns justice somehow. Also there's a protagonist that does different actions that differ to each person. Lelouch is Zero and Light is Kira, but know one knows their true identity except a few. 
Oddly enough, my discovery of Code Geass began with a magazine article comparing the two protagonists of Death Note and CG. The premise of these masterful series is completely unrelated, but the magazine devoted two pages that covered the similarities between the two main characters (Lelouch and Light), pointing out their overzealous behaviour, wicked intelligence, and anti-hero themes. Top tier anime at its finest. Brilliant plots, well written characters, and critical acclaim are what you'll find in both anime. Hell, the desire to bring viewers to both shows inspired me to make my first recommendation!Enjoy. 
Code geass and death note are increadibly similar.The star of the show is an anti-hero meaning his goals are good but his methods are harsh and crude altough i think that lellouch wasnt that much evil because he was doing evrything for his little sister and his way of always protecting the weak and you cant change the world with out alot of deaths as many people know.In death note however the main character tries to become god simply because he is twisted thats the difference between character and plot also dont let the fact that there is meccha in code geass lead you to believe that you will not like it because i cant watch anything with meccha in it but code geass is still my favourite anime, read more

Its fast-pace intense story about a high school boy who gets a power, and is determined to change the world.  
Both of the main character start with being a normal high school student but later on got the power to change the world as they want it. They are rebelling against something, in code geass it's against Britain. And in Death Note the police and the law. Both got a evil laugh and i bet that you will really like both show. 
The two main male characters think their act is justice, while they both have a rival to compete against their opinions. Also there are other similar characters. 
Both series are suspensful and have a main character that is trying to obtain ultimate power to control the world or people in some way or form. In Death Note, it was through the power of the Shinigami. In Code Geass, it was through the power of Geass granted by C.C. Although one takes place in everyday life and another is supposed to be set in the future, both have a similar concept and structure. 
The main characters on both Death Note and Code Geass are extremely smart and it seems as though they are playing a big game of chess. On Code Geass the main character is pined up against everyone else except for the people he can manipulates just like in Death Note but in Code Geass he has a SUPER POWER that helps him with some of his manipulation. 
This anime is in every single aspect SO SIMILAR(!) The comparison between the two is just unbelievable.Death Note's main character has the heroic kind of personality, hiding under a fake name and bestow justice upon the world with a supernatural power.THE SAME happens in Code Geass: *possible spoiler* the main charater also obtains a supernatural power, creates a fake person as his cover and bestows justice upon the world. Well, in this case, upon Japan.They both are hindered by an organization, and in both animes, you also see big parts of dialogue and progression of the story of both sides. In both of them the main characters have to avoid/defeat the opposition by thinking very tactically, in which both are very skilled.But the main reason they are so similar is in critical situations, the ambience, the reactions, the story, it makes you shiver in anxiousness.I experienced this feeling first whilst watching Death Note. It actually scared me a bit, but it was just so awesome, it cannot be described by words, well at least I can't describe it ;p.When I started watching Code Geass, the exact same feeling rose up again, and it told me: ""This anime is going to BLOW YOUR MIND"".I have not finished Code Geass yet at this moment, but I'll say this: If you watch these two, you'll be statisfied with anime for at least a month.Have fun an thanks for reading this! ^^ read more 
•both have a main protagonist who follow a childish notion, by their own means of 'justice'•both main characters are very intelligent in the way they contradict their enemies, when they are eliminating evil, to create a better world.•both follow paths that lead them will lead you into angst/agony/ and a sense of realism/aswell as empathy for the characters as the story progresses through hardships and meltdowns, to romances, aswell as destruction.•both animes have beautiful OST's to accompany the emotional heart wrenching ups and down, giving the audiences feelings of sadness, to being courageous and even rooting for the main protagonists sense of justice•both animes see the bitterness of life and how harsh reality can be, as everyday life goes 1 day at a time, the worlds hatred on minorities, high ranking status's of people with power, to the poverty of others and how one loves JUSTICE, •they are very similar in a brilliant genius is creating a new world, for people to live in, away from a status pyramid, where everyone is the same and should be treated with respect. if you love one, you will love the other. read more 
Both involve one man and his desire to change the world for the better through the use of a single, simple power.Though the powers are simple, the plot is very complex.  
Both series have a compelling plot and an interesting anti-hero as a main character. While Code Geass focuses more on action, Death Note focuses more on the story itself. Both series are highly recommended, but I'd say go for Code Geass if you prefer fantasy and action, and Death Note if you want something more dark and realistic. 
Both have similar premises in that a high school student gains superpower and want to use it to change the world. For viewers who love watching shows that feature a smart, charismatic male lead gaining a super power and outsmarting his opponents at every turn, using complicated tricks, these are great.There are some key differences between them, though. Whereas Lelouch in code geass is an anti-hero, Light in Death Note is an anti-villain. Whereas code geass feature a world at war, death note portray a world that at first glance looks peaceful but infested with crimes of all sorts.  
Both animes have characters with brilliant minds dueling and many psychological games. 
Teenage masterminds who try to carry out what they think is justice and who lose themselves in the process. Both Light and Lelouch struggle to make the world share their view, while fighting either a super detective or an entire nation. Will the masterminds succeed in justifying their extreme actions, or will they lose to insanity? Both anime are psychologically very interesting and the plans these two scheme will leave you mind-blown at times. Definitely worth watching! 
Both main characters are smart, popular students, they receive a special power and with that power they try to change the world into a better place 
It has similar strategy elements and also very good characters, although there is fighting in code geass, which is completely different to death note. 
Both series revolve around a main character who wants to make the world we live in a better place. They both achieve a certain 'power' that helps them to achieve this goal. The battles in both series are based on deep tactical planning. The main character is borderline crazy and will do anything to achieve his life long goal. They will have you drop your jaw at how smart they are and surprise you every episode. 
If you love Death Note and couldn't get enough of it and wanted more then Code Geass is the better version of Death Note. Not saying Death Note is bad cause it's pretty epic but Code Geass has that too smart to be true lelouch. He just like Light but he has the power to control a person's actions. Lelouch goal like Light goal is to create a world of peace. It's epic to the very end and will keep you guessing how is he going to get out of this. 
Both of main characters gain the power of destroy others, anonymously. They first do it for ""justice"" but then, you know.. 
The exceedingly intelligent protagonists of both series act in order to create a better world for those around them—mainly their younger sisters—and utilize supernatural powers in the process. Though both have distinct motivations, their primary intentions are, at their roots, selfless. One of the most notable connections that can be drawn between the two series is their chess game format. Chess is a motif present in both CG and DN; in each storyline, developments are often viewed as part of a giant game. Twists, traps, and deceptions pervade the conflicts in both series, and both Lelouch (Code Geass) and Light/Raito (Death Note) assume chessmaster roles.Code Geass and Death Note each evoke their own questions of social justice, presenting two main sides that clash to protect their notions of integrity. Among these questions is the ubiquitous ""Do the means justify the ends?"" The series share the refreshing depiction of unorthodox viewpoints as being as worthy of acknowledgement as socially acceptable ones. Though it can be argued that objectivity fades as the episodes progress, in neither case is there a concrete definition of ""wrong"" or ""right"" forced upon the audience. As well, neither protagonist, despite his major role, is morally infallible. read more 
Code geass Is really similar to Death Note. You look from the ""Villain's perspective"". Both of the protagonists hides their real identity, and has a similar goal.  
Both anime have similar male leads and both heroes are very intelligent  
Both focus on an intelligent, popular, high school character who upon receiving supernatural powers seek to change the world and enforce their own kind of justice whilst also trying to keep their identity secret.They also have about the same number of episodes. 
Both have the same style of story. The story is told from the side of the villain, decision making and development of both series is very similar. 
Both protagonists are arguably closer to villains than actual antiheroes and are basically trying to take over the world through the mystical power given to them and ass pulls. Their respective show's entertainment value comes mostly from the thrill of seeing what new way they'll utilize to use their power to deceive and utterly humiliate their antagonists. 
Similar plotBoth protagonist are getting rid of someone/something without revealing his/her identityBoth with a special gift 
the plot is the same = both heroes use their supernatural powers to change the world.the ""friends"" of the two heroes are their worst enemiesThe plot is revived when both characters lose their memory.the two heroes realize that they are not the only ones to hold this power. 
Death Note and Code Geass definitely bring a lot of differences to the table, but they have very similar feels, particularly when it comes to the often frantic cat-and-mouse aspects of the shows. Also, the respective plots of Death Note and Code Geass hinge on the existence of a supernatural power (or object with supernatural power, in Death Note's case) which further makes them comparable 
Character us kind of crazy like in death note. Both characters also really smart. Both kind of got a mind fuck sort of thing going on(death note much more though) 
Both have a main character which is extremely intelligent, and is trying to use a new power they acquired to change the world in their own way.   
they both want to create a utopia..they have supernatural powers given by a powerful entity..both have mind games that makes you think..the protagonist is seen as evil... 
I've seen this anime recommended here before, but I thought I'd recommend it anyways.They are both similar because it's about someone trying to change the world. They both have or use supernatural powers, and that leads to corruption of themselves. Both the protagonists of the story have original good intentions, but are doing it in a immoral way.  
Both has the most FAMOUS anti-heroic protagonists. And they been compared countless of times. The argument of ""who's better"" is still very much alive even after so many years had past since the ending of both series. 
Lelouch and Kira are in the same intellectual level and look for similar things: changing the world (but wich one in a unique way). Both story are of  high quality level and are well thought. And Code Geass (in many people's opnion) to surpass Death Note in drama and emotion. 
1) Both of these have male characters who believe themselves to be Gods.2) Both use strategies to figure out problems or get what they want.3) Both become friends with people they need to so they can use them later on.4) Both are highly intelligent.I think they have some similarities, and though I definitely loved one more than the other, they are both worth watching at some point! 
Both geniuses. Both do justice ... Or at least claim that .. Even you do not know which side to choose.Both are fascinating, and both have amazing ways to win, and they always do unexpected actions.Just trust me and believe me, if you love one of them, you will love the second.The only difference is that in Code Geass there is more action. 
These both have a very smart protagonist that plan a lot. This isn't the only recommendation for this so I won't go into detail. The main difference is that while Code Geass centers around someone who looks evil being good (he's basically conquering the world) Death Note has someone who looks good doing evil (murdering people). I could go into more detail (the statement above is basically wrong) but then I would be spoiling stuff. 
Light is very much like Lelouch, both are geniuses with darker streak, both enjoy viewing people as chess figures in their grand game and both pay a price for it. 
They both have intelligent main characters that have been gifted a super-natural power.  
Death Note is very similar to Code Grass in that they both have a very intelligent protagonist who has the ability to manipulate people in order to achieve their goals. They are both very great and I recommend them to everyone.  
The most obvious recommendation of them all. Both have main character with superpower with some important flaws. Light and Lelouch have similar personalities, they both want to accomplish their ultimate goal no matter the cost, but Light is more radical. Death note´s quality drops in the second half, which is a shame and a reason why i enjoyed Code Geass more, but they are both worth the watch. 
Both series have story about main character being criminal and student. Both of them want to create a new world that would be better (from their perspective). The most similar thing is about how they execute their plan for building a new world. 
Both shows feature a strong, powerful and ingenious main character (Light and Lelouch) who wish to change the world for the better, but eventually get drunk on their power and fail because of their own ambitiousness. Both are also set in a less realistic version of our world, in which the protagonist has some unusual power which allows them to control the actions of another human being. Murder, mystery, mendacity and manipulation are prevalent elements in both. Also, though the shows may be unrealistic, the characters are excellent; strong, believable, real and very relatable. Although Code Geass has more violence and action than Death Note, the similar dark themes, brilliant plot, and strong characters (who I grew very attached to, very quickly) kept me absolutely riveted to the screen while watching. If you like Death Note as much as I do, Code Geass ideally should be next on your plan-to-watch list.  read more 
Both a battle-of-wits anime.Both Lelouch and Kira (Light) have some sort of special ability to cleanse the world of evil. But they turn out to be like the antagonist.Both animes are unusual for Shounen- seeing that they focus on out smarting the other instead of fighting. 
Both anime resolve around two characters that use their power to manipulate people around them. Both have a goal of changing the world to what is best in their mind. 
The main characters are very similar. They both get an unique power. They want to eliminate the unrighteousness in the world in their own way.The both series are very unpredictable and exciting. 
Both series have several geniuses that wage a psychological war against each other with grand goals in vision. Both set of characters happen to be possibly the most clever characters in all of anime. 
Death Note is about a man that gets a gift that will allow him to change the world for the better.He is a super-genius (gets 100% for University-level tests without trying)Code Geass also stars a super-genius man with a new power that'll allow him to change the world. There is a very slight similarity in their ability.Both animes are brialliantly written (Death Note somewhat better, though) and I personally am attracted to intelect. 
Code Geass and Death Note are similar in one way: A complex, riveting storyline with minimal room for romance. A lot of strategy and guesswork is involved. 
Mind games are important part of the both series.Main characters are both ultra-smart students with a unique supernatural power and trying to change the world with using substitute idol characters while they are staying behind the scenes. They both sacrifice their present and future in order to change the world. 
Both of them have protagonists who are anti-heroes that try to shape the world but use unfavorable means of doing so. 
they have lot of things in common but the most important things are that the heroes' community think they are representing the evil but indeed they are building the justice by their own ways , other one is that their precious people are standing in their way (actually they don't know about that) but light and lelouch handled them as a roadblocks and removed them .finally , i thought these 2 points make them so similar , so who love one of them , surely will love the other one . english isn't my first language , so excuse any mistakes . hope you found it helpful , Jana ^^ read more 
Within both series, the main protagonists (Lelouch and Light) both attempt to achieve to ""save"" their country from its corruption.Both involve psychological turns and major mind games that'll leave you in suspense. 
In Death Note, one of the most obvious and enticing elements are the mind games played between Light and L, and Light and Near.  This is also found in Code Geass, which not only brings these mind games to the table, but introduces them on an empirical scale-- literally! 
Both feature insanely intellectual main characters, and feature intellectual meta-game chess-like plots. 
The mains caracters of these two animes are both very intelligent and inherits of a huge power they will use for their own visions of justice  
There is quite a great deal of overlap between the two series. Both start of with a guy who by some means aqcuires the power to change the world. Both of these guys fall into the category of characters that are far from the good guy, but you will end up rooting for anyway. The amount of mindgames is huge in both Death Note and Code Geass. If you liked any of those aspects about Death Note, particularly that last one, then you will definetly enjoy Code Geass as well. 
Lots of strategizing and thought processing. Differences: Code Geass has mechs and is near-future-ish, Death note's MC is a normal guy. 
If you took Death Note and gave it action, it would be Code Geass. Two insanely smart guys out to change the world with a god like power that was given to them. Thinking 20 steps ahead of their opponent as if they are playing chess. Both with moments of comedy and specks of insanity. At the end of both you will sit there thinking ""wow, what really just happened??"" or y'know more like me lying on the floor freaking out. 
Both male main characters start off as regular teenage boys until they possess the power; either the notebook or geass. The plot is very similar too, as their main goals is to change the world into a better place.   
Both animes main character are very intelligent and both are very similar to each other. Both characters contain some kind of special power, and are trying to change the world by facing enemies that are close to them. 
These 2 Shōnen anime are very similar in many respects. The main characters both receive a controversial power from an unknown being.The both try to purge the world of evil, acting on their own ideas of justice and equality.The main characters both have a secret alias; Zero and Kira.All in all, Code Geass and Death Note are very similar and are must-watch anime series!I AM A FUCKING WEEABOO 
Death Note reminds me of Code Geass because of its intense emotions and the constant twists and turns the plot takes. It excludes certain events until they actually play apart in the overall scheme and it always keeps you guessing. It is also very cool to watch Light and L's minds work and plan 50 steps ahead just like Lelouch.  
I believe you would like Death Note because even though the plot is totally different, it has similar aspects to Code Geass.  They both present the stories of antiheroes - good guys who are trying to change the present world into a better world, while at the same time trying to hide the fact of who they are.  Both must face ordeals on their path toward their goals.  
Light and Lelouch are exactly the same; both MCs fight for what they believe is true justice. The strategies used in both are complicated and give the series a nice touch which makes them so enjoyable. 
Both have the premise of strategy. Both Protagonists are kid geniuses. Both have special powers. 
-Young intelligent school boy comes across a mysterious ""power"" and uses it to try and change the world-Ideologies and morals tackled in various ways-The ""power"" when described feels very real, little detail left out giving it a suggestion of possibilities-Although Code Geass uses Mechs, just like Death Note large amounts of intelligence is used, isn't just brainless fighting  
Both animes contain a smart and nice student which is the main character. Both characters obtain a power and they will try to change the world with it. They will both use a nickname to protect their identity. 
Lelouch and Light are one and the same. They receive super-natural powers to enable them to embark on a journey to seek justice. Only Geass is explosive, about shooting/smashing everything and over-the-top Hollywood tactics all day, while Death Note is more thoughtful and down to Earth.Would recommend Death Note over Code Geass any day, but for any who've already seen one watching the other is certainly not unthinkable. 
Both animes count with an unexpected complex history, two of the best animes I have saw ever. The two have also one important aspect for me: the main character is one of or the most powerfull one in the serie. They are kind sympathetic and are much inteligent. Anyway, you should watch both and take your conclusions, personally, both are just epic. 
Cocky narcissist receives super power with limitations that enables him to try to take over the world. Shenanigans ensue for both series and the ladies love both protagonists. In both series the protagonist is an anti-hero too 
I know these two series are recommended to death but it's not just the popularity that sets them together. Code Geass borrowed significantly in the wake of Death Notes popularity. The main character's in both series share similar motive and battle their opponents on a strategic level that is above most people. 
Very intelligent high school student Being granted with supernatural powers and using this power to change the world and not merely their surroundings... even if it means to use dark and wrong means to achieve this dream... this is the main theme for both of these stories.Despite the time set difference I believe that anyone who enjoyed watching one of these psychological thriller then he will enjoy watching the other, the main protagonist of both series have much similar points and there's a lot of duels of wits and sharpness. 
for people who like thrilling anime where the protagonist controls everything!! 
Both have smart Main Character where both have special powers. [Death Note & Geass]Both can manipulate the way of death/Control people with their powers.Both main characters are trying to change the world to be better place. Of course on their on perspective. Fighting for justice. 
The characters are similar in the sense that they're bother very intelligent and have an ability which makes them more superior than others. In both shows they're trying to change japan in one way, in code geass it's all about trying to free japan from britania while in death it's about creating a perfect uthopia. These two animes also show the darker side of people as both light and lelouch are not pure of heart and will do dark things if necessary to achieve their goal. 
Both shows are full of suspense, death, emotion, and include a genius character who doubles as a ""bad"" guy. Both had me on the edge of my seat every single episode. 
The main character is very similar to Light as they are both too smart for their own good, have a supernatural power that they used to ""take over the world"", they both want to make the world a better place and they are also massive chick magnets. They both have amazing soundtracks and characters with plot twists that you will not see them coming. Code Geass is basically Death Note with Mechas.  
Together with Death note, Code Geass were the first animes to catch my attention when I was reommended by a friend to start watching anime.This anime is highly regarded by many, as one of the best animes ever made, and that is completely justified. It's story and the characters are carrying the series perfectly, but what really sets this anime (Deathnote as well) appart from all the others, is the strategic mind of Lelouch. He is a genius, you can't avoid having to pause once in a while to catch up with the amazingly complex thought trail of Lelouch.I highly recommend Code geass. To the new, and the experienced anime watchers. It will not disappoint.Death Note is a series I didn't really finish. Once one of the characters died, i stopped, but I intend to watch through the last part once I get the time.The part of it I did watch, had some simularities to Code Geass, in the psycological aspect. Light is a character that's really hard not to admire, he is a strategic genius, and the series overall is a masterpiece. read more 
Based upon the intellectual capabilities of the main characters and each main character has a unique power that they can use. 
Both are very focused on strategies. Lots of mind games. The main character seems to be evil and his “rival” is in the justice/lawful side. 
As well as Death Note, Code Geass's story revolves around a highschool kid who suddenly obtains a power that will allow him to achieve his most desired thing, in this case world peace( and something else but no spoilers).If you liked the way that Light and L seemed to always be one step ahead of each other and continuously ""defeat"" each other, then you will like the way Lelouch(the main character) makes strategies, because, well, it is pretty much the same way of thinking.And last but not least, both of these anime have that soundtrack that makes any normal activity look awesome, just like chapter 1 of death note when Light starts writting all those names. read more 
Both the animes are for intellectual people with a lot of strategies and brainwork.You will find similarities in the lead role of both animes too. 
'Code Geass' and 'Death Note' are both what I refer to as strategist's animes.They both include an individual, very smart for their age, as the main protagonist. They both appear to be good, but with an evil side to them, and this is why these animes are both impressive.I found that both animes had me guessing the strategies and plans that the characters had put up, trying to get past them, but failing miserably, due to the gargantuan plot twists.Both animes have an art style that I love, and develop each character very well.I would wholeheartedly recommend both animes and the sequel to 'Code Geass', which takes off at a seemingly impossible point.  read more 
Pretty easy to notice the comparison if you've seen both animes. Main character in both shows has an ability/power to manipulate/eliminate their enemies, aiming to make a better world. 
This is an obvious comparison, but not for the reasons most people belive...The thing most similiar thing about them is their pace. In every epiosde there is something happening, there is a lot of action (both mental and physical) and the dialogues are very fast; because of that, not a second is wasted. The tension between two opposing factions is almost continouslly present which builds the dynamic even further. After you have finished an episode, the next one demands to be watched. The second thing very similiar is the main character's usage of other people as his pawns as a mean to victory/salvation and the main character's vision of creating a better world or an utopia for worthy people.Both series quoestions what is right and what is wrong and if the end justifies the means, as well as other controversial topics like - should all human lifes be measured equally.If you liked Code Geass, you will probably like Death Note, but maybe not vica-versa, because the atmosphere in the two is different. While Death Note has a lot darker and gothic feel to it while Code Geass' athmoshepre is more revolutionary and, well, more colorful to say at least.(I avoided watching Code Geass because of the art style and the mech genre, but later when I decided to give it a shot I realised the charm of the anime and it quickly became one of my favorites.) read more 
Both shows involve a teenage boy with supernatural powers for their own advantage. Both shows involve the main character trying to take over the world and try to make it better. 
It isn't strange that two anime (CG and DN) are compared together forever because both followed about the high intelligent and hot bishounen  hero that  are very ambitious and badass to conquer the world and both guy are legend of badass magnificient protagonists all times. 
-both have male leading characters- both given something to control people- both are very powerful people- both are very smart, sly and very cunningLelouch and Light both want things to changeboth have a destruction into creation ideaboth get a power from something paranormal/ out of this worldThey have different endings thoughThey both basically play it out like a game of chess 
In both series the main character is a very intelligent student in Japan. They receive supernatural powers and get a supernatural companion. Since they're dissatisfied with the world as it is, they take the initiative with their new opportunities. They want to create a new world order. In this case both assume a pseudonym and to hide their identity, they are lying and lonely. In order to achieve their goals both main characters become morally questionable. 
Both have similar main characters. Both have similar situations given to the main characters. If you liked any of the characters, you'll most likely like the characters here as well. They both have somewhat similar abilities and rely on their intellect. 
Both involve a boy who is granted a 'power' that gives him an unfair advantage to help achieve his goal. Both shows have the main characters trying to outsmart their rivals and use their new powers to control the world. 
Code Geass is really similar to Death Note.Both have similar nature. Main characters have special powers (geass and death note). They want to be like a God and be justice. They make 'justice' with their powers. They must hide their identity. They are known in the world. 
Code Geass: Hangyaku No Lelouch, despite its unique animation, shares a lot of similar aspects to that of Death Note such as both of the following series have main protagonist that uses special power in order to conquer and lead the world to a better and peaceful place. Light, Yagami uses Death Note to support his goal while Lelouch, Lamperouge uses the power of Geass. They both not only uses their attained power but also are very intelligent which enables them to use tactics and plans to counter their foes while hiding their own identity simultaneously.Both of the series also have a lot of sad, yet beautiful moments with great soundtracks which makes a show 'Master Piece'. Thus, Code Geass: Hangyaku No Lelouch is 'Ideal Recommendation' for Death Note so why not give it a shot? read more 
lelouch and Light both have the same narcistic intelligent kind of i'm always 5 steps ahead of you attitude.of course in both franchises there were times when they panicked and needed to recollect their thoughts so it wasn't like it always worked out for them but they both strongly resemble each other apart from the fact that they are in completely different stories with a completely different concept.the plot is comepletely different except for certain situations wich also require the same deduction skills light has.both anime are really wel done animation quality wise aswell as story telling.i strongly reccomend both 
Both involve schoolboys bent on creating a perfect world using an supernatural artifact (or power, in the case of Code Geass) to aid them in their goal.Couple things to note about Code Geass: it's a mecha series and it also has a second season, Hangyaku no Lelouch/Lelouch of the Rebellion R2. 
Light and Lelouch are practically the same character. Both shows feature quite a bit more intellectual, and both main characters have very similar personalities and abilities. 
Both of these anime begin with a highly intelligent main character who is in high school. In both of these anime, the main character starts out with a very pessimistic view of the world, and hate the way it works, and when they are given supernatural powers, try use them to create their idea of a perfect world.  
Both main characters are similar in that they both receive powers and then aim to better the world with them although through violent means, they are neither protagonists nor antagonists, rather they are somewhere in the middle. They both also have two people facing of against each other even though their goals are the same; they just have different methods. 
Well, the main characters are similar, the story is a bit different, but we see a main hero fighting his friends and becoming a greater evil to defeat the current evil in the world. 
Both protagonists lead a double life, with both sides of the coin  differing dramatically from each-other; on one side you have the seemingly perfect high schooler, while on the other there lies an ambitious genius with overarching plans for everything and everyone. The world is their chess game. Some people are just too smart for their own good... 
-Both are anime in which the protagonist is a genius and that is his greatest weapon to achieve his goal -Although Code Geass has elements of Mecha the anime is not focused on that but on war. -Both manage to obtain a supernatural tool for themselves and use that tool to achieve their goals. -Light Yagami (Death Note) and Lelouch (Code Geass) are in the top 5 of the most intelligent characters in the history of anime without a doubt. 
Both of the protagonists inherit an amazing power and start trying to change the world. They think they're doing the right thing, but there are two opinions on the matter.  
A show with a genius protagonist who gains powers and uses these powers for their own personal goals.  
Well written characters and plot with the protagonist being a mastermind character. The difference is setting, with Geass being more futuristic with a different atmosphere than Death Note. If you like one, you'll definetly love the other. 
Both have strategist anti-hero protagonists granted with powers to change the world, rivalry, and plot twists. Too good 
Similar characters with a cold, dark air about them. They both put up facades to how they truly feel and act, both kill in extraordinary ways, and have a special ability, and a female partner.similar feel to the anime (if you truly watch anime you know what I mean) 
Its similar due to the fact that both main characters really think a lot and they're both smart. Another one is both are fantasy type, and both uses there heads to come up with plans to transition to their next phase. 
- Watching both of them I had similar feeling- Both of them are masterpiece- Lelouch and Raito are very smart, powerful and serious- Both of main characters have got powerful weapon. Lelouch - geass and Raito - death note- Lelouch and Raito have got ''support""- Lelouch and Raito want to change the world 
This recommendation is probably a cliche.Smart protagonists possessing special powers make their attempts to change the world with good intentions while not being afraid of getting their hand dirty. A little similar atmosphere and these are the most popular anime. Both give an awesome and incredible impression. 
Both shows are about insanely intelligent protagonists simply attempting to take over the world in their own unique ways.  They also both have a quality dip in the second half.   If you looking for a show to make you think, these are the two best picks. 
If one were to watch both of these series around the same time, it would be impossible NOT to notice the similarities. A brilliant, bored teenager gains a supernatural power that allows him to finally accomplish his lofty goal, through any means necessary. Light and Lelouch are both such similar characters, but at the same time differ as the series progress. 
they are both a lot like each other because there both hero is anti hero that uses a lot of tactics and his brain 
This seems to be a very common recommendation; and with good reason. Both main characters ( Light + Lelouch) are unusually intelligent people, and are both in high school. They both want to change the world for 'the better' although for two very different reasons. In both anime there are many deaths involved as well, as in both anime -SPOILERS- there are main characters who kick the bucket. Also, both anime are very well known are respected in the MAL community. Finally, they are great starter anime for those who aren't so knowledgeable with anime in general. 
Both involve intelligence duels instead battles with just brute force where the smarter and better strategist wins and both have stories with protagonists very intelligent and cold trying to create a new world of peace, regardless of what may need to do to reach your goal. 
Both animes involve someone, more intelligent than most, and their psychological outthinking and prowess. Although one is situated in a much more modern setting as opposed to a futuristic one, the idea of destruction as a form of creation is existant in both. However, the endings and the fate of the individuals differ, and the winners and losers are different.  
Same plot style and intense pshycological battles  
Both series have those unexpected and mindblowing moments, and both maincharacters have the same ideal: they think the world as it is at the start of the serie is rotting. They want to change something about that by using something supernatural. The twists in Code Geass are some way similar to those in death note; like a game of chess. In both series the maincharacters make their foes powerless one by one... 
These anime share several traits, as narcissistic ""geniuses"" inhabit a world populated with idiots gain chuunibyo-like powers and go on maniacal killing sprees, mistaking murder and/or revenge  for ""justice"", manipulating those around them into helping fulfill their self-centered power fantasies. Full of overblown drama that 13 year olds love, completely unlikable characters, a panoply of plot holes, and absurd plot twists, both were made by excellent studios (Madhouse/Sunrise) that can make even the most ridiculous story lines become revered.Both anime are far longer than they need to be.Each has also supplied its fandom with a smorgasbord of yaoi fanart.If you loved one you're bound to worship the other as wellAlso: Pizza, apples, tennis and cat chasing.This recommendation has been done to death, but I thought I'd put it in a different perspective. read more 
Light and Lelouch both have a unique way of thinking and dealing with certain events. They both are both very intelligent and strategic and have a supernatural power that works in favor for them. Both of them  seem to fall into the role of the villain rather then a hero.  
They are both about students who were granted special power and the story of them trying to change the world and make it a better place.  
Similarly to Death Note, Lelouch Lamperouge (Code Geass) is the main protagonist who uncovers the power of Geass to force other to obey his orders against their will. The biggest difference between both shows is the Code Geass is set in a utopian world where Britain rules most of the world, while Death Note is set in modern day Japan. Code Geass is filled with similar story-telling elements Death Note is know for, such as clever and complicated story-telling, a suspenseful atmosphere, and plot twists and turns that will have you watching for days.Personally I prefer Code Geass over Death Note, because Code Geass tells a better story and rewards a loyal watcher of the series with a fantastic ending, which Death Note heavily lacked. read more 
The reason why Code Geass is similar to Death Note, is probably mostly due to the protagonists themselves. Both protag. have a special ability that none around them have, and they are determined to use the ability to do what they think is 'right', but however they are considered 'the villian' in the show by other characters. Both protag.  also have to struggle between school life and their plans, while also keeping their identity a secret. 
Well, you'll see this line everywhere in the world wide web: ""Watch Code Geass when you like Death Note""and yes, they really have some similars, for example the personality from the Main Character or the obtained superpower from a mystical essence.But at all they have more differences then common parts. The Main Plot is in the most way completely different and the location, presentation and plotting as well.Go ahead and watch both shows when you liked the MC but don't think the story is just copy and paste. 
1.Lelouch the Code Geas and Light from Death Note are very similar. The main characters, who are actually the bad guys, fighting for justice and a better world.2.Lelouch has a friend whom he had known 7 years, Suzuki ,and fighting against him, as well as a Light has L that are in some way, friends.3.Lelouch  had to kill their loved ones to make a dream come true, as well as Light. 
As Death Note, Code Geass has great focus on the physicological of characters and the characters will allways try to use the logic to reach their goals. If you're looking for something smart, whatch it. 
Both of these anime's have similar main characters who gain supernatural powers and use it to try and change the world. But due to this new power they begin to get corrupted and lose sight of their original goal. 
both anime are about a single person that uses supernatural abilities to try and change the world that they live in 
The main character on both shows are almost identical in terms of the way they think and how they want to change the rotten world they live in, and will go to any lengths to accomplish that goal even if it means going down a dark path.  Both characters are very smart but also very manipulative, they also have supernatural powers. These two shows are considered the best in anime and I'd recommend it to anyone. 
Death note has a genius main and has a similar feel, it is also about strange powers and world domination. 
These are both intellectual anime about a genius main character with help from a supernatural being to help them achieve their goals.  
The protagonists of these series are given special powers that they use to try to change and rule the world. They deceive and kill other people to get to this goal and may seem like arrogant, narcissistic, jerks. There is strategic thinking and you never know what's gonna happen next. They are both admired or hated by the world through aliases. The second season of Code Geass is much better than the first and not as hollow and boring as Death Note's second season, which was the reason for its downfall, in my opinion. In both, there is a lot of serious talking and a lot of strategy and tactics used to get rid of the protagonist's enemies. But in Code Geass, there is more action and fighting (since it is an anime about war). So if you're a fan of action and suspense, Code Geass is the right anime for you.  read more 
The main character is genius in strategies and tactics, and of course they are the most charismatic character of all anime's character. The challenges in both anime are great that make us can laugh because of their successful strategies.  
Both series feature a main male lead who are too smart for their own good, and use their wits and ""supernatural powers"" to outsmart the rest of the characters on this show. They also have very similar personalities, and can be seen as an ""anti-hero"" protagonist, one whom the viewing audience can root against. 
Both main characters get some kind of magical power they use to change the world. Lelouch tries to change the world into a place where his sister can live peacefully while Light tries to change the world into a place with no criminals, where he rules over everyone. These anime's can sometimes feel like a chess game because every thing they do gets consequences.  
Both protagonists are geniuses on a mission to make the world a better place while taking extreme measures, due to their newly acquired power. They both believe that they have to become evil in order to defeat evil. 
both have a mastermind main character trying to change the world. i highly recommend both.if you liked one of them, i can absolutely assure you that you'll like the other just as much.How ever code geass has a bit of science fiction and action while death note does have too much of that. 
Both shows share characters are given powers from outside sources (Shinigami/CC). This power allows for both main characters to strive for power. They give a perspective of viewing the world as an equation and rely heavily on strategies. They are both extremely well done and the endings are similar too. 
Both anime have intelligent main characters who fight their battles intellectually instead of having a superpower competition. In both anime, the main character is more of an idealist for a perfect world and will stop at nothing to achieve that goal, even betraying allies and sacrificing innocent people along the way 
Both main characters obtain a new power that allows them to attempt to change the world. Both main characters have very controversial ideals. If you liked death note then you'll love code geass  
Both protagonists think they are superior to the rest, using people as pawns to fulfill their ambitions. In addition, they have supernatural powers that help you control people's actions, as well as discard people when they don't need them. Two anime that catch you for the complicated situations with which the protagonists fight and their ways of dealing with them. 
The setting and the overall feeling of these shows are very different, but those two anime have a lot in common. Both series have intelligent main protagonists who are sick of society, and suddenly they find a super power that they use in order to change the world for their own reasons. Both of them are ruthless sometimes, but they are the best examples of anti-heroes, who are genious and think about plans that will blow your mind. Also, both anime have a political feeling and they are full of strategies and plot twists. 
To me, the main thing that connects these two animes is that the main protagonists are trying to make a better world according to their own opinions. In both Death Note and Code Geass, the main protagonists are very complex characters, with clear motives, sheer dedication, and are very intelligent. A few times whilst I was watching Death Note, the plot confused me and I was lost, but it was quickly resolved by an explanation by Light as to what he was doing/planning. This also happened to me in Code Geass. I got confused but Lelouch explained what he did and it blew my mind.  read more 
Pretty much the same concept, although Code Geass is more in a Japanese anime style. In more detail: both have an underrated main character that already shows some kind of brilliance from the start of the story. The real action begins however when they are offered a special power which turns them into the most overpowered character of their realm. Both end up backfiring and making our MC suffer. Even the side characters have similar traits and many of the same concepts are touched upon. The only thing death note definitely showed itself superior in to me, is the secondary main character/ antagonist. Whereas L of death note actually felt as a separate main character, of which you could completely crawl into his mind, follow his thoughts, feel his emotions and gave us one hell of a game (of opposites) with light, the antagonist of Code Geass felt less of real character to me. He seemed to be just an archetype, whose goal was to hinder our real main character and added way more annoyance than enjoyment for me. CG has more of an Japanese anime feeling to it rather than the more western looks of DN, with a more surreal setting and of course mecha. If you dont mind these you will probably enjoy both seasons of CG   read more 
Both consist of the main protagonist is an intellectual battle of strategy and planning. They each contain highly intelligent characters and a few plot twists to keep the story moving. Both endings are incredible and help tie up the stories. Much like Light Yagami, main character Lelouch appears to be more of a self-centered wannabe-ruler who wishes to recreate peace within the world, like Death Note. Each main character has a fantastical power to alter the world around them and attempts, with their increased knowledge, to bend people to their will. Death Note centers around the police while Code Geass centers around the military, both being similar working bodies in tactics and action. While Code Geass is infact a mecha anime and Death Note is not, the themes and character relations are very similar. Romance is not of the utmost importance in either anime, but the main character does use the theme to his advantage is both. Overall, if you like the themes of questioning justice and fighting through mental tactics, then these animes will fit rather well. read more 
Both anime is similar because:-Both main characters both obtain something that could be used to change the world.-Both main characters are really smart.-There's people trying to figure out who the main characters are.-Both anime makes you think 
Similar plot line where Protagonists are tired of the way their world works and by the end of first episode they get the power they need to change it.Similar mastermind ""enemies"" to protagonists which try to take them down. 
Are you a fan of Death Note? Are you looking for an anime like Death Note? Many people recommend Code Geass when the topic of animes like Death Note comes up. While Code Geass is an amazing anime the similarities with Death Note are minimal (but it still definitely deserves inclusion).What Code Geass does offer is a mind game adventure between the Rebels and Empire (similar to that of Light and L). Along with plenty of suspense and plot twists that make you want to keep moving through the episodes (similar to that in Death Note).Code Geass is set in an alternative present that contains three separate superpowers fighting for control (Britannia, the Chinese Federation and the Euro Universe. The anime takes place after the conquest of Japan by the Britannia Empire which leaves the citizens without rights and freedoms.The story follows Lelouch Lamperouge and his sister (exiled Britannia royalty) as he tries to find the person behind his mother's murder. In the process he gains support and popularity amongst the Japanese rebellion.  read more 
Both follow a very intelligent protagonist who decides to face societies short comings, with their own 'ends justifies the means' way. 
Both the main characters are geniuses, bent on bringing justice to the world, in their own peculiar ways. And both these anime are masterpieces. 
If you want something like death note this is really the only anime for you! Death note is my favorite anime and I've been looking for show like it since I've watched it there are many similarities ie both give the viewer a choice of which of the 2 main characters  they want to win both give have genius protagonists both have protagonists use questionable methods for what they want...only difference is that death notes ending is ass. 
When I was watching these two I noticed many similarities. Both main characters are seemingly geniuses that are gifted with a power that lets them cure the ""corrupt"" world in their eyes. Another thing I found was both main characters tend to be very manipulative and bend situations to fit their plans. 
The extreme clever and intelligence of the main characters gets you to both root for them and feel their emotions. With their clever plots, its impossible to like one and not the other. Code Geass has much more action while death note is pure wit (which is excellent)And if you haven't watch either of them, tell me, what have you been doing all this time? 
If you liked the manipulation skills Lelouch had you will like the way Light acts to get what he wants. Both series have very strong main characters. The intelligence of the characters makes them seem godlike in the face of adversity but like Lelouch, Light also has his share of enemies. 
Everything is a chess game. That is the best way to describe these two animes. The MC's are smarter than practically everybody and they do whatever to attain their goals. Very suspenseful and two of my favourite animes.  
- it's difficult to decide what is right and what is wrong in these anime- the protagonists are trying to change the world they live in- newly acquired powers change their lives drastically- they use those powers to kill people  
Want to watch two people, two friends, secretly be enemies? Well these are your shows! Fantastic anti-heros make for twisted plots that you will leave you awestruck. 
Code Geass is political with a focus on military tactics as opposed to cat-and-mouse detective work.  But the show's protagonist, Lelouch, shares many similarities to Light, including his high intelligence, manipulative attitude, and ""the ends justify the means"" mentality.  Apart from Lelouch's granted power of persuasion, there are no supernatural elements to the show, making Code Geass feel a bit smarter and much more grounded than Death Note. 
Both series are very alike:-Both MC's are very intelligent-Both MC's wants to make a better world-Both series are psychological and have action-Both MC's have the same personality-Both MC's have special abilities-Both MC's sacrifice those close to them 
Both animes are based around a protagonist that obtains a magic power and uses it to take justice into his own hands. In both of them, there are battles of wits around the use of the power and keeping their identity a secret while maintining a ""normal"" life. I liked both of them, but I liked Code Geass more because I think it has a better ending 
This seems to be a pretty common comparison - probably because Light and Lelouch are practically the same character. Both shows feature quite a bit more intellectual sparring than your typical shounen fare, and both main characters have very similar personalities (they're closer to being villains than heroes) and abilities (ridiculously powerful but with prominent weaknesses that require careful planning to circumvent).   
Both main characters take on the ""antagonist"" role to cleanse the world of evil. Both MC's are very strong and especially Death Note have a very good character as opposing role to this plan. Death Note is a bit lacking in the 3rd part of the anime, and is mainly carried by the 2 opposing main characters, while side characters are somewhat uninteresting, while Code Geass have an amazing cast with a ton of interesting characters from beginning to the end.The music in both anime is also really great, but by now it should be no surprise that both of these anime is def worth a watch. read more 
The theme and feel of the show the are extremely similar. From the very beginning you can see that the main characters have similarities so there is really no point in spoiling major plot points for the sake of convincing you. If you enjoyed watching the main character of one show outwit his opponents every which way then this is a show you have to try. 
Both series have a ""not your typical"" protagonist, that obtains a certain power to change the world.The thrill in both series is to see how the strategy works out, and how this effects the other characters & story. 
Both have a lot of intelligence in parts of perssonagens , making envolvernte plot the beginning to the end 
A high school student is given a power, with that they decide to change the world into a better place, they both slowly form alliances and the people see them as heroes. 
Both animes has quite similar features. Death Note revolves around Yagami Light who uses a notebook called Death Note to kill people. While Lelouch Lamperouge of Code Geass use a power, Geass, which compels other people to obey him. They both witnessed what the world has come to and want to change it for the better at ANY cost and are willing to sacrifice anything for that cause. They both work behind the shadows and are two of the biggest anime masterminds/puppet masters. A mysterious being aids them in their path to success. Their enemies are L Lawliet and Suzaku Kururugi, who wants to change the world through the ""System"" and condemns Light and Lelouch's ways. Both Light and Lelouch are high school students who wants to bring peace to the world but their ways are ""extreme"". Moreover, DN and CG, both are one of the highest rated animes in MAL. read more 
-both main characters have the same goals-it's set in world where there are a lot of crimes -both main characters hide ther identity -and both are smart animes 
I believe that these two animes are the best. When all action/op fails The Brains get the spotlight....Both the story begin with college students i.e Leouch Lamperouge and Light Yagami.Both the mc may look handsome caring and helpful .....but keep in mind they have an equally cunning,cruel,sadist,seaming,evil side too...one might just mistake them to be a devil.Both receive a special power ;leouch gets the geass-the power of the king while light gets the death note-the power to kill anyone by writing their name in the death note.Both the mc wish for a better world ..where all can live a happy life tho their main ideology is nobel but the path they choose to achieve it is beyond cruel.Being smart ,intelligent , cunning they exploit their special power to the fullest to achieve their goal.....""End justifies the means"" true to these words they are ready to deceive , manipulate and even kill people without any hesitation ...going as far as to even kill their own relatives when they proved to be a threat to them.The battle of minds, the madness of the mc., epic quotes and battle etc. make these two anime the best.The plot and twist and the mc are amazing and hence re watching them is totally worth it.You will in love(with the anime) from the very first episode.Hope you like it :)(my first recommendation...on my favorite animes) read more 
The series have a very similar premise. The protagonists are both given a supernatural power that they use to try and change the world. If you enjoy watching anime that keep you at the edge of your seat you'll probably like both the shows. 
The main characters both fight for justice in cruel and harmful ways.  
I don't need to tell it but both the series have an MC with a god like power with which they try to create a new world where they could live and main characters end up to be antiheroes 
The series are both about 1 person that gets a power to do good things, but some people think it isn't good what they're doing, some people do think it's good whether you decide if it isn't or is is up to you. (In death note, the killing of criminals, and in Code Geass, he wants that the 11's to be called Japanese again) They have both a friend, who's on the 'battlefield' an enemy. 
They are both very psychological, the main characters are always outsmarting the rest. More action and a better storyline in Code Geass while Death Note is more of a detective and mystery anime in my opinion. 
They both feel pretty similar.Both great gateaway animes.Both masterpieces. 
Both anime explore the premise of having psychological battles, whereas Death Note is quite mild when it comes to action, Code Geass excels by having thrilling war battles as well as psychological ones. 
Death Note and Code Geass share many similarities. I feel Geass is a bit like Death Note's teenage brother - less dramatic mind-games and more epic action with mechs, gunfights, airship battles and boobs. It still maintains the mind-games theme with our anti-hero Lelouch being similar to Light Yagami in many ways, but if Death Note was intriguing but just a bit too slow for you - Code Geass is a great shout 
The main characters of both series, Lelouch and Light, are very similar. Both are prodigies who intend to change the world for the better using their special powers.  
This is a rather well known recommendation: a two anime rivalry known through the entire anime community. Both Code Geass and Death Note have similar characters; primarily Light Yagami and Lamperouge Lelouch, two evil geniuses striving to achieve their ""justice."" Both shows cover rather complex plans made by their protagonists, meaning the plot sometimes gets really complex. That said, it has multiple other similarities, but I mustn't spoil the fun. 
Ever wonder what it would be like to have the power of a God? The ability to kill any person instantaneously or how about have people follow any command you give? These anime don't ask what it is to be a hero, they ask if you would become a villain in order to save your world. These series are for anyone who wants to watch a game of chess take place on a global scale. These anime are two of my top favorites of all time (I don't have that many, promise). If you're looking for an Epic series then watch it because you'll ask yourself the question, how far would I be willing to go?  read more 
Both anime have awesome main characters that are to smart for their own good. Both anime will have you heavily involved in the story and characters until the end (not so much with death note since the second season isn't anywhere near as good as the first). The mind games characters play against each other in these are amazing and very entertaining to watch. Death is a great anime to help feel the void from Code Geass. 
This should come as no surprise but seriously if you have watched and enjoyed one of these two series and haven't watched the other I strong suggest you do so. Both series share a similar narrative with one guy gaining a supernatural ability that he uses in an attempt to change the world! While they are not of equal quality when it comes to the story and overall cast, if you liked either Light or L in Death Note, you'll probably love Lelouch vi Britannia!  
If you liked Code Geass then you'll definitively like death note since both anime have a very good story development and both focus a lot in the psychological of the character. 
the same main character who tries to change the world where he lives 
Both main characters have a justice sense of thinking, and want to help the world, even if the world disapproves. Both have amazing characters and enjoyable moments. 
Another monstrously successful series about a gifted youth who uses his power to change the world. Less political intrigue and a lot less high school shenanigans result in a tighter narrative. 
I think both animes contains a lot of mind games, cool and genius main characters.Also with their powers, main characters can manipulate others in different ways. 
Main champions wants to be a god of the world. This animes logic is comming to intelligence war. 
The two are very similar, but for spoiler reasons I'll be pretty vague! When you actually watch you'll notice many similarities and if you liked one you'll probably like the other! Similarities:-Main characters are shown as natural, kind of narcissistic, geniuses-MCs use the supernatural to gain power *CG: Geass (Basically mind control) *DN: The Death Note (Basically the power to kill anyone, within certain criteria)-MCs are given their supernatural abilities by a supernatural being-MCs have limits to their power, i.e. how they can use it/who they can use it on-MCs are not the only ones who have had access to this power-MCs are basically up against the world with at least one person they use as a 'tool' to gain their desire-MCs use their power to cause some change to the world-MCs involve their immediate family in their affairs and their actions directly affect their family (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧ read more 
Mastermind head character.Plan from beginning trying to prevent trouble still have effective action. 
If you liked death note, then Code Geass is basically something similar to death note. I personally like Code Geass more. Despite the art not being really good, the story is one of the best out there! Both the stories have a Main Character that can be viewed as a good guy or a bad guy and both the stories have a second main character which can be viewed as the opponent of the main character. Both L in death note and Lelouch in Code Geass have a high level of intelligence and they are both very smart. The story might be boring to some of you out there, but trust me it gets way better! I'd rate this Anime 8.5-9 out of 10! read more 
The plots are very similar yet very different but both are about mind games and planing ahead. 
Code Geass is literally Death note with mechs. Main hero plans how to beat his opponents, then uses his power to do so. Lot of figuring stuff out, twist and turns in both of these. And both have main characters that you love and hate at the same time. 
The story for both of these shows involve incredibly smart protagonists that are high school students who have the desire to change the world around them to their liking. Both protagonists also obtain something that gives the character a chance/push to make progress on their goals. The main characters also have similar thinking/a view of justice that isn't seen by everyone who watches as morally right, which is why they can be viewed as anti-heroes. They use whatever is necessary to achieve or get one step closer to their goal regardless of whether the step they took to get there is viewed as cruel or inhuman. If you liked one of these shows then you will definitely like the other. read more 
If you like a smart character, and mystery or puzzle or detective or some kind like that, you need to watch one of this, death note is about a person using a book to kill bad people to make a world a better place and codegeass is about robot fighting but got a smart main character that want a peace and both of the main character got a smart brain 
Similarities between "" Code Geass "" and "" Death Note ""> Having a similar character to change the world, namely, Yagami Light and Lamperouge Lelouch> Both want to change and control the world> Genius, smart strategizing> Both had another name / pseudonym ( KIRA - ZERO )> Both dapet help from ( being ) another. ( Shinigami & C.C )> Both have supernatural things that help them ( Death note & Geass )> Both think they are correct> Both have people who have sacrificed on behalf of their> Both can manipulate people ( Death note & Geass ) 
- Both focus on super-intelligent and strategic protagonists who, when they gain a power and are able to apply their sense of justice, advance their goals, assume an identity both idolized and feared by people, but still hide their true identity.- Light is more psycho, using either one to fulfill his goals, Lelouch, several times, loses control and coming out of your goal, but he blames himself, he repents and moves on. 
Both have amazing protagonists, great plot and are solid choices for a change of pace from shounen or if you're tired of lackluster protagonists. They're worth the hype and high ratings. I checked them out after hearing people call Code Geass & Death Note top tier series and afterwards I feel it is justified. It is best to not say more as it's very important to avoid spoilers with both series. Thankfully they do get straight to the point so best thing is to try at least several episodes, you'll probably end up completing it before you know it. 
Pretty obvious comparison, but I make the recommendation anyway. Both anime are driven by anti-heroes who seek to impose their own brand of justice through supernatural means. Both play out like an intricate chess game between the vigilante and the established order. 
If you like all the clever and mystery-solving situations, this is for you. The main characters are also really similar.They both:Have special powersWant to control the world or something similarThey got their power from something or someone else 
Both heavily involve tactics and many draw similarities between the protagonists. I've often found that if people like one of these, they'll like the other. I myself love both of them. 
It has similar tones to it as Death Note. But is different to make it likable as its own. I personally don't like mechs but even then this anime impressed me. 
I would say that they are quite a few similarities between code geass and death note, some being that they both focus on the story of two young teenagers who have acquired a supernatural power that they use in order to change the world to fit their own ideals. Both protagonists feel as though the world is rotten and that the innocent suffer whilst those who commit bad things live without being punished. So after seeing the atrocities of the world both characters choose to use their powers in order to right the wrongs of the world, however this results in the deaths of innocents and the loss of humanity in both characters. However the difference between Light (main character of death note) and Lelouch (main character of code geass) is that Lelouch still manages to retain some of his humanity all due to the love and affection he has for his younger sister. However Light completely abandons his emotions and humanity in order to achieve his goal.Code geass does however have a lot of plot holes and rather than showing us Lelouch's brilliance it tell us whereas death note gives us a clear insight to Light's intelligence by giving the viewer a detailed look at how Light's mind works and how he manages to manipulate people with his plans.However Code geass had one of the greatest endings of all time, not only did it wrap up the story line perfectly it was also very satisfying since it cleared up a lot of things and gave the audience what they wanted. Death note also has a brilliant ending which was somewhat predictable due to the inevitability of it.Overall both shows are amazing and fairly similar but they both have their own unique plot line which makes them interesting and captivating to watch. I personally would say that code geass is an anime which shares a lot of the same aspects as death note which makes them similar but keep in mind they aren't the exact same, each have things that differentiate with one another which I think makes them even better. read more 
Two intelligent shows that will intrigue you a lot, because of their well done construction on the development of the story (for the most part) and mainly their main characters that share many similarities, both being revolutionary geniuses that change a whole society, with rivals who try everything to stop them. 
Another protagonist that wants to change the world, a similiar series that takes it to the next level. 
Both Animes:-Have A Genuis Main Character-Haves the Main Character obtain a supernatural ability-Have a Main Character that tries to change the world by killing 
Both principal characters are barely genius and they both are looking for a perfect world which they 're gonna create 
most obvious recommendation ever, a incredibly smart guy receives some kind of convenient power and decides to use it for his own good while trying to help other humans in the process, all around mindgames, mysteries and psychological warfare, only difference is that code geass actually has war due to mecha while death note sticks to the psychological ground, also the relation between suzaku/lelouch instantly reminds of L/Light 
Both feature somewhat mind-game-ish battles in which one person tries to outsmart somebody else, and have some mild twists that you might enjoy. Additionally, the main characters have to lead a sort of double life and must hide their actions from authorities. 
The main characters suffer from a god complex 
Ideas of justice and vigilante justice; morally intriguing; will question basic premises of right vs wrong 
Death Note isn't exactly similar to Code Geass but they both have main characters who are practically the same person. Lelouch from Code Geass and Light Yagami from Death Note are absolutely amazing characters. They are both geniuses, they possess some type of absolute power, and they are also undeniably very likable characters. 
There are many things that are similar with the series, such as:1. The main characters. Light and Lelouch are both geniuses. Lelouch is manipulative, and is willing to do evil to achieve his goals, similar to Light who was willing to kill criminals to make his ideal world. They are both powerful anti-hero characters.2. Code Geass has battles between geniuses like Light and L, such as Schneizel vs. Lelouch.3. The mc's both have unique powers that they use with the intention to achieve their ideal worlds. Light uses his death note to kill people he deems dangerous or bad for the world, while Lelouch uses his power of geass to control people and bend them to his will to forward his goals.4. There are moral inconsistencies between the main characters Suzaku and Lelouch, similar to how Light and L opposed each other's ideals. read more 
One of the most engaging aspects of these two show's storytelling is through the perspective of their main characters who are both non-stop thinkers, always trying to plan ahead, be meticulous and account for as  much that can be predicted as possible. If you enjoyed one, you very well might enjoy the other. Moreover, if what you liked is the main character's intelligence, you will find it in the other work too as both feature battles of wit rather than brawn. 
The atmosphere of both of them is similar,while Lelouch takes on the world on his own,so does Light againt best of  the police in the world.the mc in both is pretty op too. 
Similarities:1- Amazing MCs2- MCs with a personal goal to obtain 3- Extremely Intelligent MCs4- MCs encounter a supernatural creature which grants them power on conditions5- Thriller Mystery Dark Gore Psychology Killings6- MCs kills many people who oppose them or are evil7- MCs try to change the world in their own way 8- MCs strategically fights against an organization9- Similar setting and atmosphere10 - Amazing OST  
both main protagonists have grey morals and will do anything to rule their respective society.both protagonists hold a special power.both protagonists have stunning intuition and wit.both are seen spiraling into chaos 
Both feature pseudo-autistic geniuses.Both are great gateway anime.Both have complex plots but aren't that deep or intellectual overall.Both are fast and thrilling.  
Both animes, have as a theme a protagonist who does everything to achieve his goal, however different from Death Note, the protagonist of Code Geass, does not lose himself and also does not do it for himself. He commits all acts, for the sake of his little sister, Nunnally, who is in wheelchairs, due to the attack that her mother suffered. Lelouch asks for explanations for the king, but the king denies the help, after the discussion, he expels him from Brittania and the title of prince and is still sold, indignant he swears revenge on Britannia and create the world of peace that his sister so wants . read more 
These are definitely good successor's of each other. They both have really cool supernatural powers in them. In addition, the main characters are in a moral gray. They are both very good, so if you like one, you'll probably like the other. 
Psychological and the main character is a genius having to face off against other genius' in mental battles in order to get his end goal; the world and all whom inhabit it to be at peace under his rule... Sound familiar? 
Very psychological anime like death note the main characters are also alike in that they wish to change to change the world. 
Both have the main character try to outsmart their opponents by using their wit. Also, they're both about taking over the world I guess. 
This show gives off the same vibe watching Lelouch overcome obstacles as in Death Note with Light. 
Psychological, similar protagonists 
You have stumbled upon the UNO Reverse card of anime. Watch as these conniving villain protagonists, tilt their noses upward, eat chips, and wear supervillain masks to scoff at their opposition. These shows take two very different approaches in two very different worlds, but the fact that they follow a protagonist who takes on the role of a villain makes them the star of the show.Death Note, in spite of the supernatural power of the Journal of Doom, takes a more realistic approach being grounded in the real world. Taking on the role of the vigilante removing the scum of the earth made detectives take notice.So, much of his struggles involve him outsmarting these detectives in brilliant schemes to eliminate his threats. He finds himself squaring off against a brilliant detective and thus the struggle between these two makes them the stars of the show, bringing all sorts of mind games and logical manipulation into play.Code Geass is placed in a corrupt imperial world where Brittan has conquered all. Now Japan makes it's futile struggle to combat the Britannia Empire. In the middle of this struggle, a discontent imperial prince finds himself thrown into this struggle as he finds the green haired asylum chick who gives him the power to change this corrupt empire. So now, Japan has a brilliant villain of Britannia to support them, winning impossible battles with superb strategic prowess. The hopeless rebellion that Britain scoffed at soon becomes a world-wide threat under the mask of the Black Prince.Both shows draws you in with the power of the main characters' intelligence, working your brain as you try to keep up with how they solve the challenges that oppose them. read more 
Both has a GENIUS character in them. 
The mani character is anti-hero Both have genius main character who want to change the world with unique power they got. 
Both series are excellent on how they put some psychologic themes into the series and keep you on the edge of your seat at all times. 
Death Note in mechas... I'm not even joking...Two incredibly smart 16yo MCs who gain godly powers from a supernatural friend and vow to use them to change the world for the better, regardless of the means. 
Both are basically the same:-A superhuman dude fighting another superhuman dude.The main difference Code geass includes final fantasy style scifi-setting,where as,Death note is more of a reality drama that exagerrates everything(in a good way) 
The MC is a strategist and tactical. The MC is evil in the opinion of justice. Awesome rivalry between two people who has different definition of justice. 
Death Note focuses on a male prodigy as well, who can violently cross the line between life and death with a power that he receives out of the blue in the first episode. Both characters have guides who explain the limits of their abilities, while being creepy in differing manners. The plots are set up elaborately, and while there is a much smaller amount of action in Death Note, the way it lays out the master plan and how the protagonist (anti-hero-agonist?) faces his threats just makes this the perfect show to watch if you've just freshly finished the Code Geass series.  
Both animes have incredible scripts;The protagonists of both works are extremely intelligent and strategists;Both animes have very good productions;Anyway, both are spectacular works! 
Scratches a similar itch, involving a super-powered psychopath attempting to change the world through nefarious means, down to the same thrilling mind-games and identity concealment struggles. 
Everyone seems to make this comparison because of the extremely overpowered abilities of Light Yagami of Death Note and Lelouch Lamperouge of Code Geass. Both protagonists are genius characters in their own right, and have a strong manipulative personality that, along with their acquired uses of a Death Note and a Geass, respectively, allows them to ultimately fight towards their own idea of a ""better world."" 
Code Geass and Deathnote are similar in the following aspects :-Main characterBoth Lelouch and Light turns out to be Anti — Hero which means that they started their journey for a good cause but ended as a villian.Both Lelouch and Light are genius in their own ways .Both of them visioned for a new world .Both Light and Lelouch had Misa and C.C respectively on their side who will safegaurd both of them no matter what.-Side charactersWhile their is kiyomi takada in Deathnote their is Euphemia who were fooled by main character fake emotion , used by the main character and died.Both have some kind of witch / devil who gave people powers without any reason . Codes in Code Geass and Shinigamis in Deathnote.- PowersBoth anime had a super power while in code Geass their was the power of Geass while Deathnote had a powerful book which can be used for killing people .-GenreBoth are Thirller , Military , Drama . read more 
Story is somewhat similar in its scope and the protagonist share many characterstic traits, first and foremost their ""unbreakable"" ""morals"" and intelligence.

-Both have a intelligent and strategist main character-Both MC think what they are doing is correct-Apparently they are doing it the wrong way-There is a character that would put the MC in trouble.-Lots of strategies that makes your brain hurt 
If you are a fan of death note .You must watch Code Geass orbif you are a fan of code geass.you must watch death note because both shows some similair thing such as:both main characters acts as villians to to apply the justice In addition both of them have a supernatural power(light has the death note and leloch has the power of geass).both shows features by planning and intelligence with a strong plot 
Both main characters go against the world and try to become the ruler of said world. Both are also very similar personality wise, and have an upper hand with a unique power, though one is more respectable than the other. These are ingenious classics of the medium and if you enjoyed one, you're likely to enjoy the other. 
Both Lelouch and Light have similar character in terms of the way they think and all. 
Both anime's have a genius ""Anti-Hero"" MC  
Two extremely genius protagonists who use what they receive to dominate their world. 
These shows are literally the exact same and they both came out at similar times:- main character is extremely smart and is bored at school- he finds or receives a power that allows them to make plans to change the world- they make an alter ego and gather a following- the character that gives the main character the power stays with them and makes comments on their actions- the authorities send someone to find out the identity of the main characters- both shows become bad in the second halfboth of these shows are really interesting and intense but they do unfortunately drop in quality towards the end (for Code Geass in season 2), They are still worth watching though. read more 
Both Lelouch and Light turns out to be anti-hero which means that they started their journey for a good cause but ended as a villain. Both anime had a super power while in code Geass their was the power of Geass while Death note had a powerful book which can be used for killing people. Both are Thriller, Military, Drama.  
Both anime contains intense battle of wits that will shape the world to come, creating moral questions of what is good and bad or what is right and wrong. Both anime will challenge your viewpoints on how to battle issues relating to society and the definition of freedom and what price one has to pay in order to obtain it. 
It's been said before but Light and Lelouch(the protagonist of Code Geass) are functionally the same character, and the two shows have a fairly similar premise. The primary difference is that Lelouch has aspirations for his newfound power at a grander scale than Light does, and that Lelouch's world view, morality and actions are challenged by his experiences throughout the story in a more meaningful way with significant consequences at different stages.  
main character has a similar complex of trying to change the world 
If you want to see animes that have MC who plans to rule the world or may have God complex. 
Just like Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch Similar Recommendations, the main character of death note got a power and started use it to get rid of the evil of the world. 
The main characters gain the means to change to world, though it will take some sacrifices and morally questionable choices to do it. They are cold and intelligent, always planning some type of strategy and thinking a few steps ahead. 
I believe these to be two great shows. Both main characters strive to become above humanity to ""save it"". Both characters have the mind set that the ends justify the means which creates an amazing character personality that you can't help but admire and love. Plus Code Geass has a banger of an opening just like Death Note which for me is a pretty big deciding factor. 
Lelouch and Light are in a similar situation where they have to play a villainous/anti-hero role using a supernatural power. Both need to conceal their identity. Both are great tacticians. 
Light and Lelouch are rather similar main characters. Although particularly clever, they're both ordinary students in appearance. However, they have secretly inherited an extraordinary power that they will use along with impressive cunning to shape the world as they wish and make their own sense of justice prevail while trying to conceal their identity. 
- Smart protoganist with tons of interesting ideas and strategies- Both have a unique supernatural power- Interesting goals and journey 
“This world is rotten, and those who are making it rot deserve to die. Someone has to do it, so why not me?” - Light Yagami. One day protagonist Light Yagami finds himself in the possession of the 'Death Note' and with it decides to purge the world of evil ans rebuild it with himself as it's unquestionable leader and god of this new world.""You can't change the world without getting your hands dirty” - Lelouch Lamperouge. One day protagonist Lelouch vi Britania finds himself caught in possession of the 'Power of Kings' and with it he takes on the name of 'Zero' and decides to conquer the world and rebuild it.The similarity between the two can be hard to distinguish at first sight but what about their endgame? What about their motivations? Well as for that Light's endgame benefits himself in the longrun while Lelouch's is set to benefit a special someone. But is either of them right? Or are they both simply out for blood. These cold and calculating individuals can clearly relate to eachother in some aspects. Odds are someone who thought one was interesting are gonna think the same of the other. read more

People who like mystery shows where the character have to use their brains to get out of bad situations will definitely enjoy these two shows.  read more 
MC who has the ability and does things behind the scenes, without the public knowing who he is 
I found Code Geass later down the line but I have to say the ideas of having power and psychology are found in here as well as Death Note. Also you could say its high IQ anime where its almost watching a board game. Basically a lot of strategy and thinking is done in the anime. Also the themes of justice and such are present here as well. Also lets be honest Code Geass is an amazing anime and one of my favorite...  
Much like Death Note, we are shown the inner workings of a mad man set on changing the world. We get to follow the man behind the mask as he marches into war with strategic methods. 
Both the shows depict main characters with unruly ambitions and their reckless pursuit after them. Both shows delve into the themes of death in contrasting ways making them enjoyable.  
Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch and Death Note are both amazing, if you haven't watch them oh boy your missing out.Death Note is similar to Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch because its about a intellectual getting a supernatural ability (or notebook) and using that to do what they think is right for the world. in both shows the mc's both have to hide there special ability (or notebook) from people they are close to. One of the big differences though, is Death Note doesnt have huge mechs killing people. 
These are mid to late 2000s animes that involve highly intelligent main characters that receive a special ability/item whether it be a notebook or a physical power. They also play kind games in both animes so that they can get closer to their goal of changing the world. 
Both protagonists are powerful enough to kill anyone with few requirements (Light needing the name, while Lelouch needs to see the face in person eye-to-eye). They are also psychological anime, and despite how intelligent the main characters are, they screw up.  
Death Note and Code Geass are essentially soulmates. Both have the same introductions, of which, an intelligent high school student finds a supernatural element, which allows them to enforce their ideals upon the world. Accompanied by their supernatural partners, both anime gives intense mind games between the MC and the world around them. However, with Code Geass, there is more focus on a range of even such as mecha fights, mild romance, and friendships. 
Both mc's are smart and had good intentions, to begin with, but are later corrupted by the power that was bestowed upon them. 
Imagine Death Note, but with Mechs. Yessir! 
Both the main protagonists and antagonists have a battle between different senses of justice. The main character of both series use intricate strategies to protect their own secrets while maintaining the facade of being a normal student. 
Both the MCs are super intelligent and try to bring justice to the world and Code Geass is one of my personal favorites do I think everyone will like it. 
The mc's have attained grand power and both are somewhat anti-herosThe mc's have a different view of justice than the public.The mc's arent afraid to kill most people.Both mc's are incredibly smart. 
Anti-heros doing something for the what they believe is greater good. 
This anime I definitely would recommend especially if you just started to watch anime. This anime is a classic and is original. The story is easy to understand and is easy to get into. I personally really liked Death Note because of the main characters (Light and L). They are both very different from each other but they are very enjoyable to watch. I honestly think anyone can enjoy watching this anime.  
Smart protagonist?Check.Fighting against the world all by your lonesome? CheckSpectacular manipulations? CheckBetrayals? Check.Extremely strategic psychological battles? Chevk 
They are very similar because both have a mysterious power of which only the protagonist knows the existence. In addition, both present a super intelligent protagonist. 
Great characters with well-developed and complex reasoning, rise to the omnipotence of the protagonist 
Two big brained protagonists trying to achieve their goals using the power given to them by a god-like figure. Both are great psychological thrillers. 
Both the Protagonist are intelligent and strategist.  
If you like code Geass you will surely like death note. Both story revolves around mind games of protagonist. But the stories and concepts are completely different. 
Well,for me these two animes are very common and for other people too. They both feature two main characters that are both really smart and intelligent and another thing is that in both animes the main characters want to conquer the world or change the world. If you watch Code Geass but want a bit more dark in my opinion you should watch this.P.S.both of these animes are from the same type of genre witch is is psychology so if you like that stuff AND code geass then give this anime a try. 
Must-watch cinematic genius. 
You will like it cause their are also mind games :) 
We see both protagonist on their journey with individual supernatural abilities, which give them the opportunity to shape the world how they desire. 
both light and lelouch seek their 'ideal' world with their power.both protagonist have a sense of justice that they want to accomplish. and they're both really smart! 
The protagonists have very similar viewpoints and personalities, and it's entertaining to watch as their well thought out strategies play out. Both also move into darker themes as the protagonist becomes more desperate later on. Also L and Light have a similar rivalry to Lelouch and Suzaku. 
Code Geass and Death Note are really similar as opposed to how the story goes. Both of the main characters get powers in order to complete/fulfill a goal in mind. Both animes has people thinking the mcs are deemed as evil. They both fight an opposing side which don't believe in their ways of achieving something. I would recommend this to anyone who likes any of these animes. 
It has similar strategy elements and also very good characters, although there is fighting in code geass, which is completely different to death note. 
amazing mc, mind games and cat mouse battles, and the main protagonist gets a power which makes him want to challenge the system. pretty similar. 
I like this anime more than i expected! The protagonist is incredible character, the topic they discuss in this show is very interesting, the mind games and the twists and turns are very good, it because of that i compare it to death note! The production is above of the others.If you wanna see a anime better planned but well centered this show is a good option!!! 
Because both main caracters are genious  
It's not similar in the world setting but on the psychological and philosophical basis.L and light, Suzaku and lelouchthey are the protagonist of respective series and have similar ideology 
Both these anime are written incredibly intelligently. While one is a crime type anime and the other is almost a sci-fi, war/strategy anime, both will keep you completely guessing at what will come next and you'll never be able to figure it out. The twist and turns both these anime take are leagues above other anime and due to this fact you'll be left satisfied and engaged the whole way through.Code Geass is a great show to get into, it isn't long in length and wastes no time getting to the point and pushing the plot forward. The art style may take a few episodes for some viewers to get used to but it's worth it if you find it an issue. The best part about these 2 anime is for the most part, the main characters are seemingly morally ambiguous and so you can sympathise with them for your own reasons but also form your own opinion on the mistakes they make, making them, in my opinion, very in depth characters.Watch Code Geass, just look at the rating of it, its no lie. read more 
Similarities:- Psychological plot- Annoyingly smart MC- The MC gets a Godlike super power- Questionable intentions- but kinda makes sense- Hard to follow plot- Both get really annoying near the end but both are worth it 
Should I really tell you why you should watch both series? The stories are similar: two guys getting a power and using it for the great of good. The characters are extremely intelligent and pay attention to whatever acts they perform. There are also supernatural characters who often accompany the protagonist. While Code Geass is more humorous than Death Note, they share many moments of tension in which many characters die. 
- Both have a very hot MC- Rivalry between opposite sides in secret of each other- Some of the greatest comedy relief- Interesting and cool powers for the MC to drive the story- Beautiful endings 
These are not my own words, but Code Geass is 'basically Death Note but with mechas and a lot more action"". If you like Light, or at least his cleverness/brains, you'll also like the main character of Code Geass. The plot for both shows are similar as well. 
The strategies used are mind-blowing, along with great plot twists and other elements of entertainment. Both shows are really great to watch. 
 Both protagonists named Lelouch Lamperouge and Light Yagami are given a power so that they can make a change in the everyday world. Both are joined by a mysterious person who seems to be from another world. Both of the protagonists also hide their identity but make their alias public (Zero and Kira). They both are extremely strategic and smart on how they choose to fight the world. Both of them have a drive to make a change and will stop at nothing to achieve their goal. Both of them also act like normal people in public because their identity is not known. If you liked Deathnote you would definitely like Code Geass and a good reason is because like Deathnote the main character faces a lot of psychological problems because of what they face.  read more 
Instead o the protagonist being an extremely over powered like; dragon ball, one piece, or Naruto. light and Lelouch rely on their brain to excel in what they are doing. Both characters are extremely likable and instead of them being good guys, these two are more like villains, but you still want to cheer them on. 
Both Lelouch and Light think ahead and use mind games 
Both have protagonists that think and act in a similar way and are hoping to achieve a goal, to make the world a better place. They are pretty much the same character in all aspects. Both shows also aired the same year. 
Yes both anime requires wide variety of knowledge and both anime are pretty similar despite being differencein genre 
the protagonist is also a very smart person with the same sense of justice as light, but he have the power to force anyone to do anything he asks for once per person. 
Both are psychological thrillers and Both protaginists are genius 
You get a Powerful and Smart and Badass MC in both the series. Both Anime have a pretty good exciting plot. In Death Note there is Kira and in Code Geass there is Zero who use their mind just like a God for defeating whoever comes in their way. 
Both Death Note and Code geass are about a genius high school student making complicated plans to change society. They both use the mask of a fake name and violence that gains them enemies and followers. They both also have a duo protagonist who is working against the first protagonist, but you root for both of them. In my opinion Death Note loses momentum part way through the series, but Code Geass has a clear direction throughout both seasons which leads up the one of the greatest anime endings. There is amazing character development that gets you excited about side plots, mech action that doesn't take up too much of the screen time, and ""super powers"" that are complex and unpredictable. read more 
Main characters are smart and “evil”. Both have a secret identity. Both have a younger sister (lol). 
Can anyone name a better comparison? Both of them are the icon of shounen anime back in 2006 and has set a high standard for any new gen anime. Light Yagami and Lelouch Lamperouge are both best anti-hero anime ever see with the same intention: to change the world into a better place, although it takes everything to achieve that goals. Both of them gained superpower to reach their goals: a death note that can kills everyone and Geass that can make everyone obey the owner of itBoth of the anime has amazing soundtrack and scoring music and filled with psychological battle, thrilling sequence, and a battle of evil and effort to reach each of their ideas of Justice. A must must watch if you just got into anime but if you're an old anime lovers like me, this certainly will be on your list. Both of them are 10/10 in my personal perspective read more 
You like thinking?Do you like to plays a math and feeling smart than any classmate?Take code geassDo you like 1v1 thinking with ur friends?Take death note 
Light tries to rid the world of criminals using the Death note. On the other hand, Lelouch of Code Geass tries to bring justice to the World with the power of the Geass. He can give an order to anyone using his Geass just by looking at his victim's eyes.  
Similar psychologically, MCs are very frequently compared in terms of intelligence, same evil vibes as well 
Both anime consists of a main character who unexpectedly receives a super power out of the blue. They use their power to bring 'justice' to their distorted society. If you liked one, you will definitely enjoy the other as they are very similar.  
The main characters are similarThe storyline is better compared to death noteThe ending is a masterpiece 
The main character gives the same vibes and sometimes even better as there there are a lot of antagonists. The plot is also great and the anime has something for everyone 
Both shows have intelligent protagonists that are doing what they think is best for the world and and act like anti-heros. They both lack moralities and ethic to be considered a “hero”. They both also gain a sort of supernatural power (for Light the death note and for Lelouch the Geass). There’s also lots of thinking and strategic moves involved in both animes. 
This is  my first recommendation so sorry if I misspell something.-Both characters are seeking to make world a better place for people.-Both of them are getting some unnatural superpower from unknown source.-Both of the MC are antagonists of the story.I really enjoy watching both series mainly because of complex story with plot twists and because of MC's which are also antagonist of the series.   Sorry for real short recommendation, it was my first one.     
They both have a genius main-character, who acquires a supernatural advantage, and tries to change the world with it. However these main-characters soon turn into cold-hearted conquerors, who are even capable of sacrificing their allies to reach their goal.  Both animes contain battles of wits. The main-character of Death Note has an equally genius opponent, while the main-character of Code Geass has many opponents. 
its basically an anime super similar to death note with more action packed storyline and like death note also answers some of the philosophical viewpoints of life and explores human nature. 
this is quite popular but if you didnt know both mcs have similar intentions both then recieve powers that help them achieve their goaldeath note is better overall but code geass has a better ending and it has the best ending in any anime i have seen 
The protagonists, Light Yagami and Lelouch of the Rebellion, are quite similar in many ways. Both plotlines include betrayal and tension between ""frenemies"" (if you can call them that) as one of the main themes. Both plotlines are also based on a teen who suddenly has a supernatural power and a new supernatural companion in the middle of a normal world.Code Geass has a lot of action almost every chapter, death note however is more 'relaxed'. In Death Note, the world was our everyday world until Light decided he had to fix it, but in Code Geass Japan is in the middle of a war, so the setting is more... disastrous than an apartment. As CG is a much newer series, the animation is a hundred times better. read more 
both have similiar mc and they have op power to achive thier goal similar dark tone and themespoiler : -bouth a sad ending 
Both main characters are super smart, have special divine power that the enemies don't know of, have an immortal partner, and have a plan to create a new world by using their special divine power that has been gifted from their immortal partner. Both main characters also faced the same action during the final stage of the show. Also, both shows are very thrilling and legendary. BTW, both main characters are also high school students. 
Just go watch Code Geass, is the same with death note but with mechs. 
They both have more psychological side of battle and both are quite dark. 
Are you one the people who just started watching anime and are baffled by 'L' and Light Yagami's strategies and tactics?Can't imagine a better anime of the same genre but are desperate to see one?I have got the perfect fit for you.Watch Code Geass. It has the most beautiful ending ever that Death note animators fully compromised and rushed into. 
similar feeling trough  the fact that both maincharacters try to save the world on a dark path. Both are psychological and I feel the anime are just very intressting. I think if you like one of them you gonna like the other one too. 
These shows are very similar as they have a similar style with plot twisting and a great ending. These are only different because Code Geass is a futuristic version of Death Note 
They both are masterpieces of anime with code geass having the best ending. "
1535,19,81,"They both deal with 'monsters' in people. By this, both shows are portraying the 'good' that each person thinks is 'right'. 
Monster and Death Note are unique in many ways. In both cases the issue of morality in its truest form, that is the frontier between good and evil, is explored via highly tense psychological thrillers. Monster is highly realistic and portrays a very believable world while Death Note has a supernatural element to it; in both the viewer is forced to think and make choices toward deciding who the real villains are and just what it is that makes one individual evil.  
Both are psychological thriller and suspense. The only difference is that Death Note is more supernatural while Monster is more dramatic. If you like Monster, then surely you'll like Death Note, vice-versa.  
Both feature main characters who are being chased by detectives. While Monster may be more mature, Death Note is just as good but more supernatural 
Both are high ranking thriller that will have you at the edge of your seat screaming for more. The mysteries and plot twists will leave your head spinning off its shoulders. I give it 10/10! A true Masterpiece! 
Both animes revolve around gone-berserk (methinks) guys. Each of their stories are mature, too-- both practically deal about murder, death, and whatnot. 
Its almost Basically the Same mystery/horror Good Guy vs Bad Guy type of Story except that The 2 Main Characters of the Show Kill for different reasons  
Both have plots that don't focus on action, instead they focus on the minds and personalities of the characters and how they interact with eachother. Both also have that kind of battle of 2 characters through non-direct attacks. 
A couple of good guys come together to hunt down a psychotic mass murderer. A macabre game of 'cat and mouse' ensues, leaving the viewer at the edge of his seat. The story in both cases goes at a very complex depth, and so do the characters.  In Monster, the story is much more complex, and focuses more on character development. Monster grapples with issues of morality and is a bit more philosophical. 
Both have amazing characters, good animation and a FANTASTIC STORY!  they are both about a serial killer but they are a little different from each other:). U will get addicted immediately! These are one of the best ever made. 
Both anime are psychological thrillers dealing with never ending battle/chase between good and evil. Both plots are full of twists and cliffhangers although the pacing of the two series are quite different. Death Note has a faster pacing with more focus on the main few characters while Monster introduces many side characters in depth through different arcs.   
Both shows deal with similar topics: equality of human life, good vs. evil, the right of a killer to live, etc. Whereas Death Note is more concentrated on the cerebral task of investigation, Monster's focus is on morality and redemption. Both of them are top-notch, but I find Monster to be better overall. 
Intellectual game between two brilliant characters that makes you wait to see the next episode. 
Death Note is a anime about crime, however it the character are top noch and the story-line keeps you at the edge of your seat. You sometimes end up trying to guess who will lose their life next and how it all will end however, i can say you will be hooked on this anime till the ultimate end. I highly recommend this anime to anyone and everyone.  
These series are both brilliant, compelling and you can't get enough of either of them! It's hard to say why these two series are like each other, i think it's the sence of justice and the practactly the same morals. Both of 'em will have you off your seat, guesting what will happen next. 
Both are psychological, detective dramas. The difference being that Monster is a seinen and Death Note is a shonen hence Monster has none of the annoying characters and general bull that goes on in Death Note. 
Both are psychological thrillers. While in Death Note there is heavily influenced by the supernatural, Monster is more realistic, and could even happen in real life. If you liked one, you should watch the other. There's a nice chance that you'll like it. 
These are both long, enveloping stories in which a mystery is trying to be solved.Both are extremely good and worth watching. Classic Anime. 
both anime contains elements of thriller, dark atmosphere, psychology, morality... And incredibly interesting plot!!! 
Both these compelling thriller animes, have morals. Hidden in the characters past, or beliefs, even the plot, there are morals. These two animes are brilliant, will leave a lasting impression. 
Both amazing thrillers that will keep you on the edge of your seat until you have completed them. 
Monster and Death Note both are psychological thrillers. Both are full of mysteries, although Death Note is more involved with the police system, and solving crime, while Monster is a mystery which the main character is trying to solve basically on his own. Both have that dark, psychological thriller feel to them, and keep you captivated throughout the whole series (although Monster is quite a bit longer than Death Note). 
Death Note and Monster both share the common theme of Justice. They both look quite deeply into human nature, and they are also both quite dark. Whilst the main characters in Monster and Death Note are almost polar opposites, the idea of a 'battle of the minds' is in both series'.  
It's really hard creating a long running thriller series in the medium of animation, mainly because animation doesn't have any real, live-action actors to evoke some kind of terror in front of a camera. Both Death Note and Monster have presented exhilarating concepts that feels totally unprecedented in the thriller genre. 
Monster is very similiar with this anime in terms of it's atmosphere and the main idea that wanted to present to audiences. They both have depressing, dark and thrilling atmosphere and it keeps going that way until the end. They both critize the system of their own time. Death Note critizes justice in 21st century Japan, Monster critizes 20th century Germany, especially Nazi rulership times with the orphanage incidents in the anime. These were very powerful critiques. They both have very memorable characters, especially the antagonists. They both are very evil but have their own reasons, their own purposes for their actions and these are the characters that makes us to question our own understandings, our moralities. Lastly, both of them have top-notch and gripping plots. You never want to stop going. Well, Death Note has more complex and witty plot with more twists. Still, Monster is enough to satisfy. It is more stable but more realistic, still worth to watch. read more 
Both anime deals with the protagonist fighting the antagonist. The character that is considered evil is considered a monster and serial killer, having cops chase after them, usually having to deal with a very intelligent policeman. 
Monster is an excellent anime. The only anime that has great suspense and mystery, and the only anime that can change the speed of heartbeat. So if you liked death note defintely check out the more supenseful Monster! 
In the world of Death Note and Monster exists a dark atmosphere and tone involving crimes, murders, and conspiracy. Both of these series are an excellent watch for those interested in for some psychological thriller themes.Both series employs violence as well as plot holes and twists that can keep a viewer glued at their seats.The psychological element of both series are present with a lot of mind twists and intelligence. Speaking of which, the main protagonist in both series are quite intelligent and cunning as with the antagonists. Both series also deals with detective fiction and the exploration of law and identity. There are moral questions involved in both series with philosophical ideas in each episode. As such, both series has a complex plot and development that focuses on events involving the main characters. Both series features murders and some other mature themes but are an excellent watch. read more 
They both involve a serial killer. But it's different. Monster is more serious. Death Note pulls you in more. They're both good, but I like Death Note best. It's cool. 
Both are very dark, have complex and interesting stories with antagonist characters that are very witty, intelligent, conniving and or just outright dangerous.  
Because has got interesting plot and  cat and mouse game like Death Note. 
They been compared thousand of times in different sites worldwide. They initially look so different but watching more you will realize that have the same issues that they want to convey: What is the extent of what human beings can do? 
Like Death Note, Monster is a crime based, psychological thriller with thought-provoking themes and a realistic atmosphere. If you're looking for a charismatic villain similar to Light Yagami, Monster has that covered too. Its main villain is both charming and frightening, and he doesn't become an arrogant prick as Light does as the series progresses. While it's much longer than Death Note, don't be discouraged. It keeps focus on its central themes the entire time and paces its story in a skillful manner. 
They're both mystery anime about a criminal mastermind 
I don't want to sound like a broken tape recorder and just state the obvious. Yes; these are both mystery/thriller/drama/crime. Yes; it involves mind games and the debate of good vs. evil. Though the main difference that people leave out is that Monster is more mature in the sense that the majority of the characters are full grown adults with hardships, motivations, and not the ""I'm crazy because I laugh a lot"" aspect that most shows portray. The world of Monster is so believable that it seems like an obscure story that the world forgot about. I admit it's 74 episodes and a bit slow paced but it's totally worth it. After watching Death Note and moving on to this is the perfect move. read more 
Death Note is a very popular anime that most people probably have watched or have heard of at one point. While there are no anime that are exactly exciting and stimulating as Death Note, Monster also has its alluring side. If you liked to watch brain battles between Light and L, you should love the struggles Dr. Tenma goes through to fix his past mistake in Monster. Dare I say the atmosphere between Dr. Tenma and Johan was one of the best thriller material. If you loved Monster, you would love Death Note as well. Death Note is more fictional while Monster is more realistic. I was personally able to relate to Dr. Tenma, which made Monster that much more an enjoyable series. read more 
Both have opposing ideas of justice, and are essentially crime detection thrillers.  
I don't actually think that they are similar with story line but, similarity to both of these shows are genres, like ""Police, Psychological, Thriller"". Both of these animes have big role in Police stuff, finding the main suspect of all murders. The stories are really deep, so deep that it makes you want to keep watching all night, because  every episode you watch, it leaves some unsolved mystery , crime  and it's hard to leave and stop watching. Story is really psychological in both series, you need to keep up with the story and try to understand the main purpose of the series, characters talk smart with deep meaning. So that's why I think they are similar, I could write more but I do not want To spoil the story, you won't regret watching these two series, they are long and enjoyable.  read more 
Both are top-tier anime for the mystery genre. They are very entertaining and well-done. If nothing else binds these two anime together, then their flawlessness would do just that. Regardless of whether or not you are fans of this genre, it is still highly likely that you will come to love and enjoy both of these vastly entertaining titles. 
Both series are masterpieces who have very psychological plots and prota-antagonists who are too smart and sick.Both have a dark atmosphere and characters who are going after the crazy ones. 
As a person who was magnetized by Death Note's unique plot and beautiful characters and as someone who rated it a 10, I have to say, starting Monster was one of the best decisions I made in my life. I know you are out there. You. Who loves DN so much that you cant find something that can stand next to it. But I did. I found it. Believe me Monster will not dissapoint you. The plot might not be the same. But...how do I put this  into words.Monster has the same vibe as Death Note. They are made of the same material. They are the two sides of the same coin. read more 
Monster is similar to Death Note in terms of tension the series brings with. But else than Death Note it needs a few more episodes until it really gets you. Overall Monster is even better than Death note, but that is just my opinion.Thriller Fans should definitely take a look!(There is a bug with recommendation order, it should say if you liked Death Note you might like Monster) 
After watching death note I couldn't find an anime that would be as good as this one. But when I tried Monster I knew that they are alike.The story is really good. You might thing that for this anime there's too much episodes, but no. All these episodes are for a great character and story developing. You loved Kira and L, you're gonna love doctor Tenma, Johan, Lunge and others.  Both animes gets you more affected to the characters and story. Choosing the sides  good or evil.Both Death note and Monster has a dark atmosphere, great story and characters, soundtracks and what I really love is the art style. It's not the anime with the rainbow hairstyles and eyes. It's realistic. Also many details and it's really beautiful. read more 
The thing that makes Monster similar to Death note is the unexpected events that happen. Every episode excites you and makes you wonder ""What's going to happen next?"" Both of them have psychological points in them.  By watching these two anime, you get the feeling that the Mangakas really are geniuses, having the ability to come up with such ideas. Monster is more realistic than Death Note, since Death Note involves Shinigamis and all. (Death Gods) And the art in Death Note is a lot better. Maybe at first you won't be able to accept the drawing style in Monster, but you'll get used to it after watching a few episodes. It won't bother you at all. I highly recommend both of these anime. read more 
both brilliant and engaging psychological thrillers that are mainly driven by the dialouge. both seem sort of upbeat at some points but have underlying dark tones of murder, isolation, and insanity, accompanied by the whole detective/police thing that drove so many people to watch death note. monster and death note show that in mentally taxing situations the human psyche will do whatever it can to save itself. 
Both are mystery thriller anime which focus on a game of cat and mouse between the main protagonists. They both deal with similar themes and raise several philosophical questions about morality. In both anime, the protagonists have to make hard moral choices. Also, they both have genius detectives chasing serial killers. While Monster is more realistic & complex and has more character development, both anime create a similar atmosphere that keeps the watcher at the edge of their seats. 
These two anime are similar in the way that they both delve really deeply into the minds of psychopaths, Johan and Light, respectively. However I feel like Monster did it in a more ""show, don't tell"" sort of way, which I preferred. Whereas in Death Note, a lot of the thoughts going through the characters are spoken on screen. Both these anime also explore the backgrounds and characters of the villains as much as they do the heroes. I've always seen Light as the villain of Death Note, he kills because of his ego, nothing more. Johan kills because he wants to see the end. These two are relatable because their motives disgusting but yet understandable. I also find that L and Inspector Lunge bear very strong resemblances to each other, they are both cold, emotionless and absolutely single minded when they are working.Both of these came out at roughly the same time, albeit having distinctively different art styles, the colours and contrasts used are strikingly similar.Death Note does contain some supernatural elements to it, where as Monster is set in our universe. read more 
They both deal with mortality and justification of an evil power for good. 
I see the two works as something of a sibling relationship.Monster representing the serious, slow-burning, down to earth older brotherly figure, and the other, while not necessarily eclipsed by the former's shadow, the stylish loudmouth, the flamboyant yet self aware younger sibling.Both works definitely exploring grounds of similar nature, yet never really in the same way. Where one celebrates its flirting with its themes and undertones of power, the other arrives after the party, picture cops with flashlights at night, slowly investigating the beginning, the middle, and the aftermath of what occured. 
Just like L needs to seek out Kira, Dr Tenma must seek out the monster. They are both psychological thrillers and created to make you think . 
The use of detective logic is well constucted through both series. Both of the plots are built up through a cat and mouse game.  
The story quite different indeed, but for someone who likes psychological anime Monster is one of the best, if not the best anime I can recommend. 
First, both shows have complex stories concerning-- revolving around human sense of justice & morality. Both shows produce insanely complex character identities, overall rare one in the world characters. Both have weird uneasy atmosphere that keeps you cautious-- maybe because of dark more-to-the-realistic artstyle, or because of the intense soundtracks... Overall, both are very similar in almost every aspect. 
Both have interesting and compelling charactersBoth raise interesting moral and psychological questionsboth have amazing soundtracks which bring the series to lifeboth have amazing suspense and drama  Overall I loved both animes and would definitely recommend watching both  
Both are dark animes that are serious,both are about mysteries and the psicology of their characters,both are well animated by Madhouse,Kira and Johan are great manipulating people's mind and both are villains.Both are great animes and have well done characters. 
Both series are intense psychological thrillers that manage to create an excellent dark atmosphere, and if you liked one, you will probably like the other.  They are similar, but at the same time very different.  They both focus on different aspects of their genre, but nail just about everything they do.  I would say Death Note is more of a thriller and Monster is more psychological, but that's not to say they aren't both great at accomplishing both. 
Both have a very dark storyline with an protagonist and antagonist who come into conflict. They both also touch on what is means to be evil, and how evil is made.  
They have a similarly themed thriller, besides being the same animation studio (madhouse), its design is also bantaste similar images, the characters are very real in both works. 
Life, death and justice are the main themes of Death Note and Monster. Death Note is a good way to introduce the psychology and the themes of Monster for a younger audience. 
Both stories play out like a large scale cat-and-mouse game with a serial killer on one end and a detective on the other. They both deal with and explore complex moral dilemmas and psychology. The main difference between these two is that Death Note deals with a supernatural element, whereas Monster is grounded in reality, and thus, more dramatic. 
Both have dark atmospheres, and have strong characters. They both are psychological shows (at least have psychological aspects similar to each other). They are both about the value of life, and the consequences of you taking it away. They both have tragic heroes and intellectual terrifying villains. The stories are different but the tones are similar. 
Both animes are investigative and deal with Crimes. But their similarities end there. While Monster deals realistically with the theme, Death Note adds Supernatural as a way of controlling events. 
The anime is mostly psychological, like death note, but doesn't have any super natural elements in it. It's set in Germany.You follow Kenzo Tenma, a japanese man that studied in germany and became the best neurosurgeon. He is married to the chief's daughter and had a bright future in front of him. But everything changes when he does against the chiefs orders and saves a kids life instead of the mayor. I won't really say anything else, but this is the first episode of the anime. You follow Tenma trying to find the kid that he saved, figure out who he is and try to kill him. There are also amazing side characters and everyone is developed nicely. There are not too many characters in the anime.  read more 
Both have various discussions about what is right and wrong in our society, as well as an excellent characterization of human corruption and the value of life. 
Both have very dark themes but also have moral grays. What really is the right thing to do? And, how can one resolve something that seems impossible to resolve? They are masterpieces that deal with the psychological and will (hopefully) deeply move you. They also feature some of the greatest villains in all of anime (in my opinion, obviously). 
Both feature a heavy psychological aspect in their story and involve police as well as a mystery. 
They are two of my favorite series by far. In both stories, the two main characters are similar in many ways, they are opposing each other, one is good, one is evil. They are both masterminds and are trying to outwit the other and are hunting each other, both trying to come out on top. The characters are flipped tho, in Death Note, the main character is evil and in Monster he's good. The story has some similarities too, like mind games, similar psychology, similar supporting characters, and there is murder and investigation in both.Monster has a little slow start compared to Death Note, but when you get to the meat of it, you can really see the similarities.I really hope you check the other out, as I think if you enjoyed one, you most certainly will enjoy the other. read more 
Both anime series', including the manga, revolve around the themes and concepts of death -- at opposite ends of the discussion. Death Note plays ""devil's advocate"" with the concept of vigilantism and how power reveals one's true self. With Monster, it deals with the responsibility of saving the life of someone who could / may be an ultimately evil individual and how that person see's murder as the answer. 
-Both are somewhat realistic tv series that deal with themes of morality and evil.-Both feature dark thematic themes, and have overall dark tones.Monster is longer and has a slower pace than Death Note 
Both shows are psychological thriller with highly intelligent characters and intriguing villains. 
Monster is Intellectually challenging. It deals with deep philosophical and psychological questions. The main antagonist's personality resemples Light's in certain ways. 
If you had a feeling that Death Note was a masterpiece you should check Monster as soon as possible. Both anime stand out when it comes to mistery and thrilling events. In Monster there are only two different ideologies: one that every single human can be trash, two, that every human has something good inside. Both anime has strong ideologies that exploits human behaviour and they can definetly keep you in your chair watching and wondering what could happen next. 
Both Light Yagami( Evil Antagonist ) and Johan liebert ( Protagonist ) can predict what happen next. They are very smartest character. 
Both are psychological thriller and suspense. Both share the common theme of Justice. The only difference is that Death Note is more supernatural while Monster is total real. If you like Monster, then surely you'll like Death Note, vice-versa.  I give them 10/10! True Masterpieces! 
Both deal with the morality of killing.Their plots both revolve around two entities who are opposite in morals.They both focus on Nihilism. Monster focuses on Nihilism within the main antagonist while Death Note focuses on the meaninglessness of justice and validity.  
Both the series belong to the same genre of psychological thrillers.Both the series have an amazing stories and characters.Both the series have some of the best villains in anime in 'Light Yagami' and 'Johan Leibert'Both the series have been created by the same studio 'Madhouse'.I can assure you if you enjoyed one you are going to love the other as well. 
Same thrill,suspense in both the series.While in Monster there is wider cast of characters.Sense of justice,what is right or wrong? both series ask these questions  
Both shows have the best villains I've seen in a show and also a good counter protagonist. In Death Note you have L chasing down Kira and in Monster it's Tenma chasing down Johan. The only major difference I can think of is in Monster there are no supernatural forces like there is in Death Note.  
If you enjoyed the dark themes and atmosphere of Death Note as well as the philosophical questions brought forward of what is right and wrong, you will enjoy Monster. It is a smart anime with a lot of twists and turns just like Death Note and has a detective that rivals that of L. The endings are also both quite unsatisfying until you look deeper into them.  
Detective chase, psychopathic villain 
Both are great shows that revolve around 2 of the main characters which try to 1-up each other. Both shows are also psychological in their own way, Death Note covering the more 'Battle of Wits' type of psychology while Monster focuses more on human emotions and actions. "
1535,13601,55,"The series have the same showcase of ""Law versus Crime"", the only difference is the themes. In terms of characters Death Note revolves around two Genius students with different personality and the anti-hero holding a handy-dandy Reaper Notebook while Psycho-Pass revolves between Cops using Advance Techno weapon that has full duplex psychological inspection that switches the gear from a Neurological paralyze r to Anti-matter shooting bullet and Masterminds that have odd different assassination fetish. 
Both anime are dark, deal with crime, and have detectives attempting to catch the criminals committing them. 
* Both have action and criminal scenes.* Both have genius enemies.* Both have characters how fight to change the state of the world.* Both are unpredictable as the next chapters.* Both have a character how rejects the state of the society. 
clearly hereLight = Shinya KougamiL = Shougo Makishimanothing is black or white...everything is greypsycho pass is in a futuristic world where the nation is maintained by a system which is trying to create a utopia but it has a dark side to itthe system has a dark side to itand what is right and wrong is questioned... 
Similar gritty tone with several shared themes. Psycho-Pass places a heavier emphasis on action but, much like Death Note, does not rely on action to progress the story. 
Another anime that features the opposition of two geniuses. But these time both, unlike Light and L, the main hero and the main villain BOTH have criminal psychology which essentially makes them similar rather than different. 
The feel of these two shows is eerily familiar, and especially till the end. They are both thinking animes with lots of complex themes and dramatic moments that take place within a nail-biting struggle between two highly compelling and highly intelligent sides as they wage a war where ideologies may be similar, but ends aren't. Both have a genius criminal with arguably just ends but who use horrible(and brutally efficient) methods to achieve it. Both antagonists are maniacs who want to rid the society of an evil that the viewer identifies and is familiar with, so their cause can often be identified with, and so choosing the villain or protagonist is not so easy.  Both also have a side of detectives fighting to preserve order and condemning the criminal's methods for his better world, even if they agree to hate the evil he is indirectly fighitng to destroy. Both have a bit of corruption and internal turmoil among the side of the detectives. Both anime play very lightly with the lives of characters, and the deaths are almost always the result of a long and elaborate game of wits, which involves a lot of nail-biting possibilities, and apprehension. They deaths are very visceral in both and leave an impression on both you and the characters.  read more 
What makes these two anime's linked is their story, and how society works in regards to crime. Death Note takes place in modern times, while Psycho-Pass is in the future, but both have the same core themes. In the end, it's about corruption and judgement. Who is fit to judge society, and how do we determine such judgement? If you enjoy such themes, and strong story lines, then you'll enjoy this anime. 
There is a villain who constantly gives detectives the runaround. Both villains are stuck with the belief that their murderous actions were acts of justice. Unlike in Death Note, detectives are fully aware of the villain's identity in Psycho-Pass. 
Both anime pose the same theme: re: how do you judge the good and the evil? The villain in Psycho-Pass is just as smart and twisted as Light in Death Note.  
Psycho pass may not be as good as death note but I do recommend any death note fans to check this anime out. Both anime have the similar feel to them. Both have the main characters who have differing views as to what is 'right' or 'wrong' in terms of justice. Similar art, similar atmosphere, both are crime, both have action,l and both do have a thriller aspect to some extent. Mainly, both are very psychological, death note is more 'genius'-like analyzing people's feelings & thoughts type of anime whereas psycho pass doesn't have main characters with as much smartness but the actions & thoughts of the characters really make you think.  read more 
Psycho-Pass is pretty much a mixture of Death Note and Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex.  It is a futuristic game of cat and mouse between two highly intelligent individuals. One being law enforcement equivalent and the other a villain who believes his efforts help society.      
-Psychological theme-A lot of death, though in comparison to Psycho Pass, Death Note's isn't very direct-Centered around crime and investigators-The main character in Death Note is similar to the antagonist in Psycho Pass-Based around morality  -Is killing okay in certain situations? Etc-Both make you think and is more for people with mature mind sets (people who know that things aren't just black and white)I think that if you liked one, you would like the other. 
Both of them are great cat and mouse games where the protagonists want to change the way the society is governed. Both make you think about ethical responsibilities and rally around an ""all or nothing"" approach. 
Both shows focus on the police point of view to stop crime. Features clever characters, outsmarting the enemy, and an overall dark atmosphere.  
Both involve crimes with genius culprits and a very in-depth interesting journey of the investigators catching the culprit. 
Both involves detectives, criminals and a pure genius character who has an abnormal perspective of the world. 
The protagonist and antagonist of these series share similar traits by being driven by one another philosophies.  Light & Koguami  are both geniuses that work for the law. They both wish to rid their world of corruption, by delivering their own form of justice. But,along the way they both become corrupted. Eventually, they both become obsessed with defeating their biggest opponents. (Light v.s L) & (Koguami v.s Makishima). If you like stories about witty heroes who struggle to do what is right without caving into doing what is wrong. You'll enjoy both these series. 
Two enemies who are similarly intelligent and hate each other essentially. The part that makes me feel it's the most similar is when she said that they knew each other better than they knew themselves. 
A lot of people die in gruesome ways and in both shows there are psychological themes.The main character in Death Note is very similar to the antagonist in Psycho Pass.Both are centred around crime and the idea of morality and what is right. 
They both have intelligent, likable main characters and villains and amazing story. Though I like Death Note more, Psycho pass is also really good.  
The main character of Death note and the main antagonist of Psycho Pass are determined to fullfil their goals, and both of their goals have something to do with the whole world.The protagonist of Death Note is being chased by the police, so does the main antagonist.These anime have a similar atmosphere, unique moments and very good characters.Very similar anime, with Death Note being supernatural, and Psycho Pass action. Almost everything else is similar. Both of them pretty enjoyable. 
-Both are really dark games of cat-and-mouse. -Psycho Pass is a bit more dark in terms of gore, but you'll love Death Note even so.-There is no solid ""good"" or ""bad"" guy in these animes. You'll just have to side with who's more ""right"". -The MCs are either ""Anti-Heroes"" or ""Anti-Villains"". All of the MCs may be right in their goal, but their methods are dirty. -""The End Justifies the Means."" is the most accurate quote to describe the Main Characters. Both are great animes to watch if you're a fan of psychological animes that dig deep on the human behaviour. 
Both make you question what is morally right from wrong and both will have you speculate what life is truly about after your finished. 
To control this world is Good man or Evil man.Both are handle crime eradication and society of morality.Protagonist of DN, Light Yagami, He uses DEATH NOTE, and kill evils for his justice.Protagonist of PP, Shinya Kougami, He belongs to Public Safety Bureau, and control many crimes along with other comrades.Both are not simple story. There are various drama, tragedy, confrontation, and meaningful depictions.Especially Light and L, Kougami and Makishima, their's relationship is the most important point in Original Story.DN's setting is modern. PP's setting is near future. Cities are similar and beautiful.Both have excellent animation, bloody and thrilling. DN focus a battle of the mind, PP focus action scenes. To be drawn into them.Finally, You will receive an impact in a certain episode. read more 
The concept is practically the same. Although it takes a few episodes to get the plot going, both have to do with someone trying to change something that has already been established. As far as death note is concerned you have Light Yagami who wants to kill all criminals to change the world. Psycho pass has Sogo Makishima who believes the sybil system is broken and tries to bring it down with similar means. In each case there is of course someone who tries to stop the respective villains, L on the one side and Akane/Kogami on the other side. 
-Expert detectives -Genius villains trying to make a better worldIf you enjoyed the cat & mouse chase of Death Note and the psychological aspect, you will probably enjoy Psycho Pass. Overall, it is more disturbing to an extent. If you can handle that and want a good crime drama, Psycho-Pass is a good anime.  
Both:-Feature a rivalry between two highly intelligent characters.-Deal with the concepts of good, evil and perfect society.-Are heavily psychological.-Have a similar dark atmosphere.Death Note focuses on it's story the whole way and has a supernatural twist to it, while Psycho-Pass has several sub-plots that tie into the overarching story, and as a sci-fi anime places some focus on world building. It also has plenty of action scenes, unlike Death Note. 
If you enjoyed the mental battle between L and Kira in DeathNote, but haven't seen Psycho-Pass then you're missing out, both are psychological, police, thrillers. The art styles for both are very similar, with a large focus on darker colours. Similarities: - Mental battle between police and a criminal.Differences:- Psycho-pass is set in a Sci-Fi world.- Female protagonist in psycho pass.- Psycho-pass follows the police's point of view, we don't see the criminals plans till they happen. 
Both are thrillers where a villain schemes and plots to remain a step ahead of the pursuing law enforcement.  They each do so while tackling complex themes about how society handles crime and punishment, as well as questioning the motivation and justification behind law enforcement entities.   
Both are very great on showing things about the worst of the society and are very dark in terms of storytelling 
They are both contains very strong element of crime objectivity and justice. There's the same wavelength of seriousness and dark content. Both of them also have detective characters--so everyone will see the familiarity of deductive prowess and psychotic to sociopath level of cast. 
* Both have action and criminal scenes.* Both have genius enemies.* Both have characters how fight to change the state of the world.* Both are unpredictable as the next chapters.* Both have a character how rejects the state of the society.  
These not similar in story-line however they're both a good crime mystery. Psycho-Pass has a more futuristic setting than Death Note. There's also a second season of Psycho-Pass in case you enjoyed the first season (and possibly a third season soon). There's suspense, plot twists and sadness to both stories. One difference between these two animes is that in Psycho-Pass the protagonist is female but similar in that she is working for government/police force. Another difference is that Psycho-Pass is set in the future with futuristic devices and technology and that there is no supernatural presence (Shinigamis). 
In a sense, Psycho-Pass, in my opinion, is a great series =, if you are a hardcore mystery anime veteran. It has thrilling mystery, mind-blowing games of cat and mouse and a sexy male lead (if you know what I mean Hr Hr Hr wink wink Light wink wink) and a dystopian  future which is 'perfect' yet flawed. If you watched Death Note, Psycho-Pass is a great recommendation, and will activate it's Lethal Eliminator on ANYONE, who thinks otherwise.(GROOOOOOAAAAAN!!!!) 
Both animes are based on what is right or wrong. The thought of justice and whether killing criminals is correct, which you see in Death Note - and a society with a perfect system, which you see in Psycho-Pass, but is that for the best? However, when thinking about ethics and morals, both these animes, show a massive insight regarding that topic. 
The psychological battle between ""good"" and ""bad"" in Psycho Pass immediately reminded me of Death Note. Both the main characters in this batle aren't defined in a certain role but are very alike and understand eachother on a different level to predict eachother.Both are weirdos/outsiders that didn't have/like a normal life.Both have a high amount of attention spend on judgement of criminals/people and wether this judgement is or can be correct. 
They both have Great Villains/Anti Heroes. They are both about Crime fighting and solving cases. They have great suspense and would keep you guessing and wondering whats going to happen next. 
If you enjoyed the mystery and detective elements of Death Note, Psycho Pass will scratch that itch and more. Raising very complex questions about morality and freedom while having an engaging story. 
Both series feature police forces trying to catch an enigmatic criminal who always seems to be one step ahead of them, and involve commentary on how society can be strongly affected by the actions of just a handful of people. 
both of these animes have two heroes with different ideology!they both contain smart antihero and hero!they both makes you think about your own beliefs 
Kill, or not to kill. The most notable similarity of these two is judging people. They commit a crime, so they are bad people. The differences are the way power works, whom the power of judging belongs to, and how they use that power for justice.The overall theme is dark, enough to give audiences intensity and chills, triggering audiences' minds to think and judge what's right and what's wrong. These two are not being too similar, yet gives the same vibe. 
If you are looking for a psychological and police thriller, both are excellent.- The two present a psychological clash between villain and hero, in which both sides are intelligent and try to predict the opponent's movements and way of thinking.- Both deliver a debate about human nature. In Death Note, he is more focused on the concept of justice and individual corruption, while in Psycho-Pass, he deals more with the origin of criminality, the law and the utilitarianism of the system, but both have several themes in common within that.- Both present a reflection of the villain's actions in society, although Death Note focuses more on that.- The two works, in addition to the police investigation, work with an element from which the public gradually discovers the rules. In Death Note, it is Note itself, a supernatural element. In Psycho-Pass, it is the Sibyl System and its nature, an element of Sci-Fi. read more 
A lot of mindgames and detective work. 
Both shows feature intriguing examinations of criminal psychology. They both have agencies that aid in the investigation to catch the killer. They both have amazing villains/anti-heroes: Light Yagami and Shougo Makishima. Both feature a fun cat and mouse chase between detective and killer, and the detective and killer in both shows are equally matched and are perfect rivals for each other. 
Both are detective and mystery. They also are a bit twisted in their own way. 
detective but very different tones. Both superb though 
The 2 are based on a dark and deep plot, wanting to know what is good or evil. focusing on protagonists who through the chapters get closer to the final battle, however in the 2 stories the plot continues after this event.Series difficult to see if you are not used to intellectual battles and a bit of existential crisis. Super recommended. 
since my first recomendation was removed for beeing to vague I will need to go into mid level spoilers for deathnote (although youre unlikely to get it) and very light ones for Psycho Pass.people who read this from psycho pass beware.Ready? okay.Both explore a Uptopian/(Dystopian?) Socieity and end up surfacing its weaknesses and flaws(still gonna keep this a bit vague). In both series we have briliant strategists opposing each other in a fight for what is just in their views. The ending also both leave open interesting questions for the viewer (I didnt watch psycho pass s2/3 because I heard bad things about it and dont wanna ruin the series for myself) Both also have a ending that qualifies as one and dont just stop after a random story arc read more 
Both are psychological and thrillerLots of ActionInvolve the police 
If you like the detective theme in one show, you are going to enjoy the other, the difference is Death Note is supernatural and the Psycho-Pass is futuristic.Both have a great intellectual duel going on. 
If you're looking for some anime that are gonna make you reflect on topics like moral, justice and distopic society, they both share this feature.Dark, pressing and passionate, the stories are something unique, the characters are all interesting and well constructed, you can't deny the ""bad"" guys have no logic reasons for what they've doing, actually you're mislead by their thoughts.Who gives us the right to decide who is a criminal and who is not? Who is bad and who acts for the good of a higher purpose? What are good and evil for mankind?Of course these 2 anime present many differences, Death Note is a milestone in anime history so I won't spend too many words on it. Psycho-Pass got 3.5 seasons (+ 4 movies), the 1rst is something terrific and incredibile, the main theme with this new society is presented and the villain is such a meddlesome character that you almost root for him! The 2nd one present some flaws, I guess because it tries to follow the first season, but it appears kinda repetitive and lacking of a good antagonist. Then there are the movies, they're all enjoyable and necessary to construct the premises for the third season: well, I was almost scared of getting disappointedl, but it actually went beyond all my expectations. New topics, new characters working well together, still we won't miss too much the old ones since they make every now and then they're appearance, the episodes last more (I think it was a good choice, so there can be more continuity) but the story is not finished... I'm looking forward to the next season! read more 
Both of these anime have fascinating villains. Each mastermind is intelligent and manipulative. Both villains have their own idea of what justice is. As a viewer, you can't help but question your own views on morality and crime. The villains' actions make you think, and this is great. It's easy to see how power can corrupt someone. Watch these anime if you want to see intelligent, riveting, elusive villains who want to fight injustice with their own ideals. Will they be caught? Will they always outsmart the detectives that are coming for them?  
Giustice is the main theme of these psychological anime 
My friend actually recommended my Psycho-Pass because he knew Death Note was my favourite anime, and I completely agree with him. The first season of psycho pass follows a cat and mouse chase with two foils. Their relationship is somewhat similar to the conflict between light and L (though Kogami and Makishima's relationship feels a tad bit forced and not nearly as well done as in death note).Psycho-Pass is also a show that allows its characters to be morally ambiguous. While Mikishima is evil because he kills innocent people, he chooses to rebel against the system to bring people freedom. The best way to describe Mikishima is if Light's ideals played more into his character.  Overall, I think if you liked Death Note you are sure to find enjoyment in Psycho-Pass.  read more "
1535,2904,46,"If your a Code Geass fan you should love Death Note as I feel they are both similar character wise. In both, the main character gets a power to assist them in changing the world for the better in their views from a party whom follows them for the duration of the series. While doing so, they both gain followers who support their ideals. While this happens, a force attempt to fight the main character and discover their true identity.Both resemble a game of chess as the main character fights to knock out all obsticles in their way to have their ideas reality. 
Psychological, intelligent, smart leads. The leads are anti-heroes while the antagonists are heroic villains (or whatever you call a villain that's acts good). Both leads want to change the world and manipulates other people. The person who gives the power follows the current user. The anime makes you predict what's going to happen, and something unexpected happens (except for VERY few cases). The user also goes insane because of overusing their given power. 
Those anime are pretty similar and different at the same time. The main caracters are both very smart and have a incredible dream. They will receive a special power and manipulate people to get what they want. They evolve in two different environnement but both will do everything that is possible to realise their projects. 
In both Code Geass and Death Note, an incredibly intelligent teenage boy seeks to change the world with a secret, hidden, absolute power that very few know about. They differ in that Code Geass is much funnier while Death Note is much more serious, and that Lelouch uses his power for good, while Light is generally more selfish, especially towards the end. If you like Death Note, you'll DEFINITELY like Code Geass, but the same is not necessarily true in reverse. I personally prefer Code Geass by a lot, but both are awesome. I watched both series in dubs. 
Both animes have a highly intelligent main character who is trying to control humanity, though not for the reasons you might think. They could be described as righteous by one person, and evil by another...both would be right. How you view the main characters morals  and relationships makes watching these series an epic experience! 
Just like the second half of Death Note, season 2 of Code Geass has everything finally come together. Lelouch and Kira have been using their power for their ultimate goals, and it all comes together in the end. The finale of Code Geass is mind blowing and you will be left in awe similar to the finale of Death Note. 
The main reason why Code Geass and Death Note are compared so often is Light's uncanny resemblance to Geass's Lelouch. Both gain an ability by accident(or by fate if you want to call it that) that can change the world. Both are very intelligent, witted, manipulative, and have a twisted sense of justice that they attempt to justify. The main difference is that Code Geass has mechs and is a bit more colorful while in Death Note, Light is a bit more clever and emotional.(The cleverness factor is up for debate, as many people will argue that Lelouch is more clever than Light)  Another important key difference is that while Light is a more overall emotional character, he has almost no emotional attachment whatsoever to any other human.(His father was minimal and ultimately just a pawn in his game) Lelouch, is just as manipulative as Light, but does show a bit more of a charasmatic nature and his unconditional love towards his sister in the beginning of the show illustrates that perfectly.Another bonus of Code Geass is that it's ending and second season is MUCH better and well done then Death Note's. Overall, If you like Death Note, then you are almost SURE to enjoy Code Geass. Geass has a bit more humor and action, may not be AS psychological, but it's pretty damn close. read more 
Both have similar characters, psychological duels between characters and a supernatural weapon that changes the evolution of characters.(Geass - Death Note)Both evolves to the point that the hole world is involved in the main character actions. 
Both anime shows are about a young teenage genius with a mysterious power given to them by a supernatural being, which they both aim to change the world with.In both cases, the protagonists lose their memories at one point, have a beloved sister who gets in danger, goes up against their father.A notable difference is that Code Geass has giant fighting robots and machines, with strategy through battles and war, while Death Note has detectives and agents, with strategy through deception and guesswork. I'd recommend both though. 
Both animes are quite awesome. There are a guy who is very intelligent and thinks carefully about every move which he makes to achieve something. There are supernatural powers and both animes includes death. 
The protagonist (Main) characters are students-Before they were both given powers, they didn't care for the world-They both to want to make the world a better place even if it means killing others-They have a somewhat a benefactor that follows them-They're both weak, incredibly smart and stragetic-They're both exposed to public with fakes namesBoth constantly have the same similar events in the story that happen in both of these animes, Just one anime is mecha and the other is more like modern day life, but are both highly similar.  
They both have a highly intellegent main character given a special gift/power that is used to change the world. Both main characters have a huge ambition.  
both animes are d fight of brains which makes u glued to ur seat..well in code geass its mecha, and in death note its shinigami(death god)..both are epic series. 
They have similar lead characters (Light Yagami, L and Lelouch) who are intelligent. They both involve mindgames between adversaries. They are both excellently well-scripted anime with a mind-boggling element of slow revelation of plot. 
Both main characters have very similar personalities; they tend to be more villains than heroes. 
The story of two prodigies who could have led a normal life if they had not stumbled upon powers beyond human expectancy. Light Yagami at one side is dedicated to dominate the whole world while Lelouch Lamperouge strives for world peace in his own ways. They have their own set of rules and ideals which they follow. 
Both of them are full of drama, both of the shows are about protecting something (Death note: the main character tries to protect justice and Code Geass: the main character tries to protect his sister) and the most crusial similarity in my opinion is that both of the shows are full of strategy and sometimes mind games. The ending of both shows is similar as well. 
Both series revolve around a main character who wants to make the world we live in a better place. They both achieve a certain 'power' that helps them to achieve this goal. The battles in both series are based on deep tactical planning. The main character is borderline crazy and will do anything to achieve his life long goal. They will have you drop your jaw at how smart they are and surprise you every episode. 
>Both anime have an insane main character, I mean both Lelouch and Light are badass who want to ""control"" the world, even tho they aren't villans they both use illegal ways to get to their goal.>Both Lelouch and Light are geniuses, they are stronger in tactics then in fights and both of them are physically weak.>Death Note have a more dark atmosphere, Code Geass is more a lightful atmosphere.>Overall I enjoyed much more Code Geass, it has much more action, the ending is much more satisfying (I mean, I enjoyed DN only till episode 30 if I remember right, last 6-7 episodes are trash).  
The main characters are more or less the same. Genius, handsome, perfect bishounen (though Lelouch is not athletic). They want to create an ideal world after gaining a special power (death note/geass) using a cruel way. They manipulate countless people and fight using their high intelligent. Other's lives doesn't really matter for them.Differences: Light is more serious, selfish and more prioritizing his live. He doesn't really care about his comrades, even the closest one. Lelouch still care about their comrades. Code Geass still has some jokes and love. Despite not as serious, Code Geass has a really serious, epic ending, doesn't even compared to Death Note. Nevertheless, Death Note ending is also epic.If you love one, you will love the other read more 
-Both series have a young main male protagonist who wants to change the world using extreme methods (despite being on the opposite end of the spectrum)-Both series explore the theme of freedom-Both series have a main protagonist who has a special power (Light's being the Death Note while Lelouch's being Geass)-Both series have protagonists who's methods are questionable and could often be debated if they are right or wrong-Both series have some crazy plot-twists 
The plot twists are full of surprise and the suspense makes you want to watch the next episode as quickly as possible. 
Both of these are deal with Badass MC (Lelouch from Code Geass and Light from Death Note) with their way to create a peaceful world despite taking the wrong way and both MC have the power to facilitate their plans (Lelouch with his Geass and Light with his Death Note) and at the anime also have little bit Romance and a lot of Mystery. 
The characters in these series are both similar, and have similar goals. Lelouch wants to achieve world peace by creating the Black Knights and fighting back against Brittania, while in Death Note, Light uses the Death Note to rid the world of villains. They both used their own method of delivering justice. In both these series the main characters are portrayed as cruel, yet are fighting for good. Both series have lots of deaths. Also, Light and Lelouch are both geniuses.  
If you like anime where the characters are outsmarting their opponents to win a ""battle"" than these both anime are important to watch.The characters in both anime hate the world, they use powers to change the world and to make a better one.  
Both are very focused on strategies. The main character seems to be evil and his “rival” is in the justice/lawful side. 
Both anime have a strong leading character who wants to bring justice to this world.Both characters are genuineness at manipulating there surrounding and both have an adviser who gave them the power to change the world.   
Both of these psychological thrillers focus on individuals trying to change the corrupted and evil world they highly detest for some certain reasons. Given powers that are highly rare for normal humans by an ally, the protagonists welcome a dangerous and spine-chilling as well as addicting and mesmerising battle of complicated minds and powers which are sure to bring disasters. With a steady flow in their pace, these anime beautifully present the depth of emotions such as love and hatred, how war can obliterate even the strongest of friendships and the strength of human ambitions. Both of these breath-stopping animes have moments which can make you shed tears or laugh out loud, moments which capture your heart and make you get lost in them. Both of them are sheer perfection. read more 
Similar characters with a cold, dark air about them. They both put up facades to how they truly feel and act, both kill in extraordinary ways, and have a special ability, and a female partner.similar feel to the anime (if you truly watch anime you know what I mean) 
Because, this anime has a main character (Lelouch) unique and almost the same as the main character anime death note (Light). berceritakan about a young boy who wants to change the world, but in a different way. Lelouch wants to change the world a better place simply for the sake of her sister (Nunnaly). This anime is interesting to watch because it presents something different from other anime. 
Similar plot line where Protagonists are tired of the way their world works and by the end of first episode they get the power they need to change it.Similar mastermind ""enemies"" to protagonists which try to take them down. 
Light finds a way to kill by a notebook from a death god, Lelouch receives the power of the geass to order anything to anyone and seek a better world to his beloved sister, incapable of walk and see. Brutal stories, with worlds that seems to doesn't have a way to get peace. Both protagonists had an objective for fulfill, their personalities makes you tremble during all the show, insanity, depression, desires, playing a game with your ideals and moralities (Is he insane? Is he doing it for a better world? what's right, what's wrong?). They are masterminds of strategy, playing fool with everyone! A special power can change their lives and achieve what they couldn't until then.  I recommend both of them! When you think that there's no way out, there they go with a back up plan! It's just amazing, it can surprise you until the end. Although Code geass answer all your questions along with the serie and will hurt your feelings with the dramatic end, death note makes you want to know what happen after the end, an obscure end that captures your mind.  read more 
Both have genius protagonists both give you a moral choice both don't have a clear cut good and bad both have a protagonist that has methods that many might not agree with both the 2 best Animes in my opinion!  
The similarity of these series is in the main character with a God complex and some supernatural power using which he's trying to conquer the world. Find out what happens to every worlds' conqueror yourself. 
This show gives off the same vibe watching Lelouch overcome obstacles as in Death Note with Light. Season 2 
Both anime focus on the what is true justice and how the main character uses 'evil' as one way to achieve it. They know how the world needs to be changed, and focus on the special power each has received to reach the new world. 
Yeah, if you've watched Code Geass and not Death Note, go watch it. They're known as brothers, even twins. Great, genius main character with magical powers can can kill people.  
The protagonist of code geass like light is really really smart and also receives a power that can change the world with the difference that he´s not perfect like Light that is excellent at everything and can make every plan he thinks to work. Unlike Light, Lelouch is weak at phychical activities and he´s plans often go wrong, sometimes really really wrong.The fact that Lelouch has all this fails gives you the change to relate better with him, also one diference that for me is very important is the way they deal with the people around them, Lelouch llike Light use people to his one benefict but he cares about lot of people and he carries all the sins he commits to himself unlike Light that just doesn´t care about anybody.Light has the death note and can kill people just by writing their name but has a lot of rules that he discover as the serie progresses. With Lelouch is the same thing he get´s the power named geass by a girl named c.c that for me is one of the best female caracters ever and with that power he can give any order he wants to the people he meets but with some limitations.So if you liked Death Note for sure you will like Code geass too, it has psycological conflits and interesting tactics, plot twists, more action than death note, a really carismatic and smart protaganist and all the philosofical conflicts that came with a relly bad ass power. read more 
In both animes the main character - an ordinary boy in the beginning - gets super-powers and decides to change the world by violent means and intelligent outsmarting. 
Both have protagonists that are brilliant and play mind games. There are certainly striking similarities. Note: Only recommend if you 1. Liked Lelouch 2. Liked the strategizing and foresight in Code Geass 
it is one of the best series i have ever seen . if you have watched R1 and like it then believe me this season is gonna blow your mind (especially the ending).  
Both feature a main character who is very intelligent seeking an ultimate goal with their new bestowed power. Good dramatic moments throughout both where the main character's intellect is the thing giving him the advantage. 
Like everyone who watched both show knowCode Geass and death note are similarBoth MC are similar both want to create a new and idool worldPeople want to stop them Mind game - twist and turn that's what both show are all About  
If you have watched death note or Evangellion i would definitely give this a watch. It has an amazing story and you would be missing out on a rollercoaster of a ride. The main characters in it have amazing backstory's and you get to have a great connection with some of them overall one of my favourite anime's and if this helped then make sure to give it a watch  
Both main characters of these shows have a similar feel . 
Its full of main character acting like he is not terrorist and they both have smart Mc's "
1535,5040,42,"If you've ever found yourself wondering about what would happen if Light Yagami was a pitcher in a baseball series, instead of attempting to become a God using his notebook of death, then the answer is simple: One Outs. It was made by the same studio, Madhouse, and every aspect of the show - ranging from the dull colour choice and realistic art style to internalised thought emphasis - highlight this fact. It's impossible for anyone aware of Death Note to watch One Outs without thinking 'DEATH NOTE!'. Both the series itself and the way it was adapted are just too similar. Even the vibe the opening and ending give off just screams DARK PSYCHOLOGICAL, as opposed to baseball anime.What you have to understand about One Outs is that it isn't a sports anime. Baseball, taken to absurd extremes for entertainment purposes, is just for decoration. What One Outs is is a psychological warfare series. Every pitch becomes a life-or-death mental battle. This is because, rather than just winning matches, Toua (the lead of One Outs) bets everything on not giving up even one run. By the end he has to deal with sabotage from his own team, in addition to the opposing team, due to his Light Yagami-esque genius resulting in his 'no outs' contract bonuses costing his team so much money. The series is actually more enjoyable if you don't know anything about baseball and can overlook the baseball rule absurdity.  read more 
They don't rely on action but tension and suspense created from an ensuing battle of the wits. You could say that the Pitcher is to Kira as the Batter is to L or vice versa. 
Death Note and One Outs both are the same ""type"" of show in that the approach to each episode's plot is the same: using psychology to try to outwit your opponent. 
The style of this anime makes me feel like i'm watching Light play baseball. I wasn't expecting much out of this anime at first, but it really drew me in. If you liked Death Note, you will definitely enjoy this anime. 
They don't rely on action but tension and suspense created from an ensuing battle of the wits.  
At a glance, they may not seem related. One is about baseball, the other mass murder. However, both series share a striking similarity. That is, they have excellent battles of wits and mind games. If you liked the things L did at the beginning to pinpoint Kira, or your mind was blown by the epic climaxes of Light's actions(Potato Chip scene for example), then you will probably like One Outs as well.  Just as in the first half of Death Note, the pacing is excellent, and there is loads of tension as each scenario builds to a climax. Truly an excellent series for viewers who like being surprised. read more 
The way the teams are tryin' to make a fool out of each others is quite similar to L and Light. 
One outs is similar with Death Note But One Outs is About sport. The way of figuiring out the problems from Death Note is almost the same as in One Outs but even Better 
Both of these animes tantalize your brains. you will be wowed at the ingenious plans. In These two animes that are seemingly worlds apart (shinigamis and baseball), are really as similar as two animes can get. The key ingredient is the smartness, as some typically refer to as ""brain-f***"" 
Although delivered in different circumstances, both series have psychological tendencies that shares a similar feeling and maintaining a sense of mind games between the characters.The main character in both series are intelligent, cunning, and always uses strategies to solve their conflicts. Mistakes can cost them big time but they always try to stay ahead of their adversaries.The main protagonists also has similar personalities and throughout the series demonstrates their intellect in various mind games. 
I know, that OO is a sporty type and DN is an action, but the way Tokuchi (OO) resolves problems in the game is similar to the way L does. I think OO has awesome OST, while DN has interesting plot. I think both titles shouldn't be compared, but both are worth to watch. I recommend them. 
Both shows use suspense to attract the audience. Both shows have an extremely intelligent main character.While both shows may seem very different, (gambling in baseball, and killing people) they are similar in how they attract the audience!If you liked Death Note, you will also like One Outs! 
Both have many mind games between the main character and his opponent. Both are very thrilling and fun to watch. One Outs is more on the baseball strategies side whereas Death Note focuses on crime and mystery a bit more, but both have the same feeling when you watch them and are recommended. 
In both animes the main person(s) (Yagami Light, Ryuzaki - Tokuchi) is very clever. They make you wonder about what will they do next.  
Although you wouldn't expect it, the feel of this anime is very similar.  It's full of intense psychological battles and mind games - battles of wits.   One Outs has the good qualities of death note with out the brutality.  People who liked Death Note should give One Outs a try :)Basically, imagine Light as being a less paranoid, gambling baseball pitcher. 
Different genres, but they're really similar! Both anime series are about power of intellect. You can know nothing about baseball, but you'll do justice to Toa's tricky plans!  
Two genius's's (genii?).Masters of intelligence. One in murder. One in... Baseball?Many of you found the best thing about death note was Light outsmarting people when it appeared as though he had lost.The same thing happens in One outs with the same level of intelligence from Tokuchi.In fact, in one episode  Tokuchi's inteligence in outwitting his enemies was literally jaw dropping.Some of you will be sceptical about a baseball anime.Dont be. This is Death note (in baseball).Would love to see Yagami and Tokuchi play some time. 
the main characters of both TV series are one in a billion if you are up against them its better to die rather than have a face off with them . In One Outs tokochi goes out to conquer the world of baseball meanwhile Light is on a conquest to become god of this world they face many trails but get out of them by using thier brains and nothing else 
Though of entirely different genres, both anime's protagonists engage in psychological battles with different situations they face, not to mention how similar Tokuchi seems to Light and similar art styles when their reasoning. 
Surely, One Outs is the sports version of DeathNote. Both main characters have badass brain and strategy. When you watch the first episode, I am sure you can not be helped to stop watching again and again till the final episode :D 
Despite the very different themes, (OO's story driver: baseball politics; DN's story driver: power of death) both MCs are portrayed in similar respects. Both have high aptitude for critical thinking and an arrogance to match their ""one-step ahead"" thought process. They seem to always have the answers to unsettling and problematic circumstances. They each thrive on rivalry; (a noteworthy aspect in DN, to a lesser extent for OO) 
One Outs is very similar to Death note in the fact the both could've turned out to be a classic sports and mystery respectively, but both chose the psychological route. But unlike Death Note, in One Outs it is not 2 geniuses dueling it out in a psychological game, but instead merely one man who controls all in the game like they were pawns. Both series were animated by Madhouse as well. 
One outs are the only anime like Death Note, just in sports genre.-Both anime contains genius characters.(like enourmous genius :))-Quite similair atposphere and little bit dark-Mind games between the characters.-One outs has just one minus - unfinished story, if you wat to know how the story ends, you must read the manga (it's worth it) 
-both of those series have smart main characters-The Main Characters in those series try to outsmart their opponet and play mind games-Both very psychological animethe most significant difference is that One Outs is a baseball anime while Death Note isn't a sports anime and it's darker than One Outs 
- They both are by the same production, Madhouse.- They both have characters who can manage to get out of tough situations in relative ease due to their impressive intellect. 
toukuchi toua the main character in one outs is basically light yagami playing baseball. two shows are both psychologically beating your opponent. one is killing and the other is with baseball and gambling. tokuchi kinda looks like hisoka from hunter x hunter too lol 
Both shows have intelligent protagonists, rogues and calculators, although we have some exaggerations and freaky things, both shows deliver good surprises and great strategies, the protagonists' anti-heroism gives a greater charm to both shows. 
Both animes have main characters that make very carefull decisions by always calculating the odds.Main characters of both animes are always two or even more steps ahead of their opponents.Their protagonists have always everything under control and are not afraid of the outcomes.Both animes will make you a better speculator in life. 
I got the same vibe watching One Outs as I did watching Death Note:- both MC's are calculating and extremely smart- they are relentless and will use any underhanded trick to stop their opponents- both have back and forth psychological battles that will keep you at the edge of your seat- both are very high-stakes (even One Outs, it is for millions of yen)- they are produced by the same studioKeep in mind that One Outs' psychological battles are centered around baseball though, so if you don't know the basic rules of the game, you should probably stay away. 
The two main characters are masterminds in their own ways. If you liked Death Note for it's reflections and ruses, you will love the way One Outs evolves thanks to Tokuchi's (One Outs main character) stratagems. 
Both Animes:-Have a Genius Main Character-Have the MC get into seemingly inescapable situations-Have battle of wits between two intelligent people 
Both……are psychological thrillers that deal with mind games and high stakes.…have an attractive, arrogant and super-intelligent main character.…rely on inner monologues and lengthy explanations of their complicated plans.…have amazing soundtracks and good animation.Death Note is a lot darker, as it is about life and death and the concept of justice. One Outs is an anime about baseball, but actually… it isn’t. I had no interest or a lot of knowledge in sports, especially not in baseball prior to watching One Outs, but it managed to hook me nonetheless. What little you need to know about the rules is always explained to the viewer. Death Note gets more closure and better characterizations, but One Outs is a little bit more consistent in terms of writing quality and creates exciting cliffhangers. read more 
Both are psychological thrillers, even though in very different settings, but somehow give off the same vibe. 
- Both made by studio Mad House.- Both main characters have an IQ of at least a thousand. 
Do you think that the one other show most similar to Death Note is Code Geass? If so, you're wrong. One Outs is the most similar to Death Note in terms of delivery and its protagonist that you can get while even calling it a different anime. On top of that, the pacing never slows down, there are plenty of funny moments, and it has a great group of supporting characters who don't steal the show or fade into the background; among all the works I've consumed, One Outs uses supporting characters the best for what they're supposed to do: support. And the villains are well done, too; even though they come and go, there's even some serious continuity with them between arcs that's always fun. read more 
Psychological shows with smart main characters that have to always be a step ahead of their opponents. They were both made by Madhouse, and feature somewhat similar direction styles, often using red and blue to represent each of its characters. 
Battle-of-wits psychological thrillers. Same studio. As others have said, despite sports and horror seeming far apart, these two shows feel very similar to watch; moreso than some of the other recommendations under Death Note. 
- One Outs and Death Note do have a really different plot,  however,  psychological aspect in both shows is very similar. - MC in both shows is an extremely intelligent guy that uses amazing strategy to win in every possible situation 
Battle of wits . Outsmarting your opponent is what One outs and Death note focuses on .  
Great character definition, Battle of wits.Tokuchi is way better than Light though. Death Note is entertaining and has a more intriguing story. One outs has better MC, better OP. Both are just great. 
Great main character with cunningness and inteligence  
One Outs' main character, Toua Tokuchi, is basically Light Yagami playing baseball. Both are very clever and have psychological tricks. If you liked Death Note, it's most likely to enjoy One Outs too. Unless you don't like baseball. "
1535,3002,31,"Both animes are very similar to each other, both heroes plot an ingenius plan to survive, both keeps you guessing until the end and hunger for the next one, both has amazing storyline. Kaiji is a genius anime without the supernatural stuff from Death note. 
The best of the best in terms of psychological mind-game series. They don't come any better than these two; Kaiji's initially alarming yet charming big-nosed art style aside. When you include One Outs, it's fair to say that Madhouse are THE studio to go to for detailed schemes and counter-scheming internal monologues. The tense intensity, which is amplified by the amazing soundtracks (same composer) and Kaiji's 'zawazawa' / narration, is truly something. Two aspects of Death Note and Kaiji differ from each other. The first is that DN has a supernatural edge while Kaiji does not. The second is Light (DN's lead) and Kaiji's (titular lead) personalities. Where as Light is so brilliant only his arrogance and an autistic rival genius can bring him down as he kills everyone in his path, Kaiji is a gullible loser. They couldn't be more different as people. To give an example, the very first game scenario occurs in Kaiji because Kaiji is in debt after co-signing a loan and is then tricked into entering a 'money or slavery', do-or-die gamble. The simplest way of explaining the series' differences is that Kaiji is always an underdog (hence the 'Ultimate Survivor'). Light, on the other hand, always holds all the cards.Of course, the above doesn't mean anything negative about Kaiji as a series. If anything, finding yourself willing on a loser and always being surprised over how he snatches victory from the jaws of defeat is more involving than watching a character such as Light win almost on auto-pilot as he attempts to become a God. We all love an underdog. What does matter is the mind-games themselves, and mind-games are where Kaiji excels. Where as Death Note didn't have any outright games to be dueled over with rules and winners, Kaiji does. There are three separate games in the first season and the stakes increase with each new challenge, to the point where they become life or death and every choice becomes agony, despite them being seemingly straightforward... but there's always a catch. It becomes so gripping you have to marathon the series.  read more 
Same style of psychologically outwitting your enemies.  Kaiji needs to be seen by more people, it is truly great. 
Death note is a complicated strategy/mystery show in which people must constantly think ahead of one another to survive. 
Although the plot is completely different, the similarities lie in brilliantly intelligent and original storylines. Death Note has you on the edge of your seat with the tension and Kaiji will get you doing exactly the same. You never know what will come next and it's strategical plot is immensely engrossing. Don't be put off by the art style of Kaiji, you won't regret watching this hidden gem. 
Both animes are very intellectually based, also the main character in both have to think several steps ahead to stay alive. 
In both anime moves of heroes are based on logic, and an insignificant mistake can cost the their lives. 
The series use the same exact fuel to power the plot, and that fuel is mind games. If you love super smart characters battling each other out in a game of life and death only using their brains, both series are for you. I have not yet seen anything that would stand to Death Note's level of depth and complexity in thinking over the next step of your opponent, but Gyakkyou Burai Kaiji comes VERY close. I have been looking for a series like this ever since I watched Death Note, and finally when I got to it I had no regrets. Obviously both series are a little different. Death Note has a very distinct thriller vibe to it with almost no place for humor in it. Kaiji brings a bit of that black humor, contrasting it with some very serious and dark episodes that I would say are way beyond Death Note's level of DARK. All in all, Gyakkyou Burai Kaiji is the first anime that comes to mind when someone asks if I know anything similar to Death Note. The drawing style may be completely different, but the plot and shenanigans between the main character and the antagonists (and the world as well) is what makes the experience akin.  read more 
These two are masters of suspense. They are both fantastic thrill rides that will leave you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. Kaiji obviously has much lower stakes, but somehow it manages to make you feel as though the world will truly end if things don't go according to plan. The music is done by the same composer, and it fits both perfectly. If you are in the mood for tension, mind-games, and psychological thrills, then either of these are a perfect fit.  
Both series have like a protagonist a super-genius guy, who have to use his inventive to resolve different kinds of problems, it feels the same atmosphere in both series, a normal guy who's life suddenly change in a short period of time, while in death note it's because of a supernatural thing, in kaiji it´s a most normal problem, money. I highly recomend both series. 
brain twisting and complex strategic plot 
The similarity between these two anime can be explained in an extremely simple manner. They give the same feeling when you watch them. They give the same rush the same thrill. The need to watch the next episode. The need to watch more. The same level of enjoyment. They are both series based on intelligence, risk and reward. 
Both geniuses ..but....Kaiji is to much dramatic and in one episode they barely advanced, and Kaiji its ""zawa zawa"" -and poor animation.no action at all, but when its geniuses- its geniuses.(oh.. and its more likely for kids, but if you want geniuses give its a chance -10 eps) 
Assuming you're not completely new to the industry or that you are not turned off by different art styles than these can very well feed your hunger for intense suspense anime which, for me, are hard to come by.They are both examples of mind games done right (for the most part at least...) with thought provoking and addicting narrative.Death note has its mystery and suspense coming from planned out strategies from both our protagonist and its rival with results taking some time to show which makes you want to see how the conflict will progress and who will outsmart the other. A game of morals, intelligence and political and moral ideals between 2 characters.Kaiji focuses almost exclusively on, well, Kaiji and how he manages to elaborate a way out of the most hopeless situations. Instead of one rival the obstacles come from games he is thrown into, The pressure and danger is more evident in this series with its numerous psychological setups usually forcing Kaiji to think outside the box and fight his own fear, lack of luck and despair. It feels more human, lacks the supernatural aspect Death Note has and goes further in terms of visual metaphors.Death note makes use of Light's thoughts to help both the suspense and the understanding of certain scenes while Kaiji relies on a narrator for pretty much the same purpose. Being death note more about Light's strategies against its rival and because with Kaiji it feels like you're watching (or participating on) a collection of deathly games I found both to be very fitting for the role they played.Death note has very little fan service and Kaiji has absolutely zero. read more 
These shows remind me of each other because they both contain a lot of mind games and suspense. A lot of high risk situations that can get your blood pumping, because one wrong move can ultimately destroy the MC. If you liked one of these shows for the psychological mind battles that happen between characters, then you'll definitely like the other 
Both of these animes are purely psychological. They revolve around the main character coming into contact with someone who opposes him, and the two having a seriously intense battles that consist of one person thinking ""I'm thinking this and there's no way my enemy will know"" and then the other person thinking ""Ah, I know he's thinking this, but there's no way he'll know I'm thinking this so I'll ruin his plans and do this"" AND THEN THE OTHER PERSON THINKING ""HA! Of course I knew you knew what I was thinking! Which is why I purposely did this in order to make you do this so I can win!!"" and it just goes on for a very long time, to be honest. But both are great!! read more 
Both anime are very heavy on the thrills and the dark, psychological atmosphere, Kaiji even more so than Death Note, and both anime have an emphasis on the strategy involved in the scenarios they present, with the main character having to devise creative plans to survive, and both anime allow the viewer to think about the scenarios along with the main character. Both anime are extremely fast-paced and addicting, and both feature peripheral, but still decently well-done thematic explorations, with Death Note delving into things like overly simplistic morality, and Kaiji emphasizing on themes relating to status and wealth, and demonstrating what people will do survive. read more 
Both contain geniuses that use intellect and mind to beat their opponents. Both want to keep you guessing. 
If you love anime with so much smartness and Characters pulls your attention to the max, Story hold much Not like any kind  that highlight on the society we live in and talk about the inside of everyone our dreams fears and our frustration and the pursuit of happiness, Message to everyone and a reminder. 
Both are Madhouse shows with a similar dark artstyle, which are about a highly intelligent protagonist and his plans to survive, using his intellect. The pacing is similar and makes both anime highly addicting. 
In terms of mind games, this one takes the cake. Just as the main protagonist in Death Note is trying to outsmart other characters with various orthodox or unorthodox strategies, Kaiji tries to think outside the box to survive and beat the gambling system and the heartless people in it. 
Kaiji has brilliant mind games as good as death note not to mention both death note and kaiji are made by same studio . Kaiji is about gambling and have amazing tension and soundtrack ZAWA ZAWA ZAWA ZAWA ZA-WA. 
In both series the main protagonist are confronted with antagonists that try to outwit them through a series of psychological battles. As there are two parties trying to outwit each other it makes both series unpredictable as the audience is constantly questioning who will be outfoxed. If you believe that Kaiji will not interest you as it lacks the supernatural elements that made Death Note intrinsically interesting you may be surprised. Even if you are not interested in gambling Kaiji's struggle to overcome more experienced gamblers through interpreting the situation and forming a simple but unique plan is reminiscent of the plans that Light Yagami formed in his attempt to learn L's identity. read more 
Both have a genius character (that isn't overpowered at all) playing mind games with people on their's intelligent level. The MC needs to stay ahead by a several steps in order to survive. Both have brilliant and tension story that will have you on the edge of your chair. 
a lot of thinking, outsmarting and predicting your opponent. Very intense and keeps you watching because you just have to see what happens.  
Both are very intense non-battle battle anime 
Both psychological thriller anime where main character is constantly at risk of failure. 
They aren't really similar. Gyakkyou Burai Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor isn't detective and main hero hasn't superpower (or super-object). But Kaiji is really wonderful thriller as Death Note, the only thing that maybe could you stop is animation, because it was made as old style. BUT it is made qualitatively. So if you aren't dependent of so sort animation and you like thrillers, this anime is for you.P.S. I would recommend to watch with subs. 
Both series are about outwitting your opponent by understanding their psychology while giving a fake sense of one's own psych 
In both animes opponents are trying to outsmart each other, you can find there lot of psychological mind games and complicated strategies 
Both are amazing thrillers (considering the first half of Death Note). The stories themselves are really different, so if you liked Death Note pretty much only because of the story and characters, i dont't know if you will like Kaiji that much. Now, if you liked Death Note because of the direction of the show, Kaiji may be a nice choice, as its direction is amazing, it builds up a lot of tension using audiovisual techniques and makes you always want to see the next episode, its overall a great thriller. "
1535,37779,30,"Both shows are thrilling, keeping you hooked to the screen, they are about mind games, have genius characters, and have very good storyline. Everything is very detailed and explained wisely. Good psychological thrillers are rare today, these shows are unique here. 
Both are about battle of wits, two sides trying to outsmart each other..Promised Neverland is a spiritual successor of Death Note in shonen (jump) genre ... 
Both animes are full of mind games and psychological fights between protagonist(s) and antagonist(s) who struggle to outsmart each other. In both shows everything is portrayed in very detailed, good looking art. 
In terms of the psychological aspects, both are engaging and keep the watcher attentive.If you enjoy good back and forts using wits and an individuals location/environment, then this would be great.Would go more into thematic similarities but that is better save for each shows to reveal. 
The mind games taking place in the Promised Neverland are very reminiscent of Death Note 
Death Note and The Promised Neverland are both anime adaptations of Shonen Jump series that keep you on the edge of your seat with their clever mind games. 
- Great mind games battle.- Genius characters.- Characters trying to outsmart each other.- Unpredictable & unique. 
Both psychological thrillers- an air of mystery surrounds the show as characters try to outsmart each other and figure out what exactly is going on. There's elements of horror/gore to both as well, and a sense of time running out. Also, Death Note is just an incredible series in general!  
Smart characters playing mind games with eachother, you can really feel the similarities in writing even when watching the anime. 
Both have mindgames and have a lot of tension. If you like Yakusoku no Neverland, I'm sure you'll like Death Note! 
Both are mystery manga with a lot of mind games between highly intelligent characters. 
+Mind games between the characters.+Its a game of cat and mouse with the characters trying to outsmart each other.+Mysterious and for the most part unpredictable.+Dark and deep. 
Both animes have clever protagonists/characters. When watching The promised Neverland i couldn't help but get reminded to Death Note's mind games and how Light tries to outwit L and vise verca. In the promised Neverland the orphans (Norman & Ray in particular) try to outwit mama and the adults with their own plans. 
both shows have very smart characters trying to outsmart each otherBoth shows have horror elementsEpic mind game moments 
i think these both anime are similar because the thinking and plotting of  Light Yagami is similar to the characters of Yakuso no Neverland  
both having characters which have great iq, trying to outsmart each other. 
Battles of wits abound between two similarly brilliant sets of people. If you like watching characters try to outsmart each other by concocting plans and cunning schemes, then these shows are for you. Death Note pits the genius of two individuals against each other while Yakusoku no Neverland leans more heavily on teamwork and collaboration. 
Both are great cat and mouse chases with perfectly directed scenes, and both are from Shounen Jump titles. 
Psychological Warfare. Both anime are a great example of mind games and being one step ahead of your opponent. Death Note's warfare is very simple, yet entertaining, with two great minds battling out the other in hopes to achieve the fall of one another. The Promised Neverland, however, the mind games also expand out to trust concerns and 3rd party members going all out to achieve their goals. Though Light and L's rivalry is a fantastic watch, The Promised Neverland is a much more thrilling anime with twists if that is what your tastes are waiting for. 
Both have a similar cat and mouse game between the characters.  Always trying to outwit one another to become victorious.  The risk of losing your life if you lose the mind game is high in both anime. 
Both of these shows have that dark, psychological type feel to them 
I'm just surprised that this isn't brought up more often when talking about anime simmilar to Death Note as they both have:- a fast paced plot that requires your full attention in order to keep up,- lots of mind games between two equally intelligent sides, a true battle of wits,- many twists and turns that will keep you guessing,- incredibly well written and complex characters,- and an emotional ending that will (possibly) bring you to tears. 
They are both full of twists, suspenseful events, and mind-blowing thrillers. Both series are packed with deep mysteries and intriguing developments that keep you on the edge of your seat. 
Narratively speaking Yakusoku no Neverland feels like a spiritual successor to the information warfare and psychological thriller of Death Note. With its meticulously crafted mind games and mysteries it takes a different approach than other increasingly more common action focused Shonen Jump anime. 
Similar but less erratic and less vague. Involves lot of planning, scheming, and countering. Easier to catch on and more enjoyable with good balance of character depth and story progression. Has lesser thrill or on the edge moments but more psychological horror. The same skills are displayed by main characters and it doesn't take long to get hooked. 
The Promised Neverland (Yakusoku no Neverland) has similar thrill and mind games to Death Note. Both series are about two opposing forces that have to beat each other through mind games and tactical elements instead of battles. They also both ran in Weekly Shonen Jump, so they are both very similar in tone. 
Both of these anime are Dark Fantasy anime. Those who liked Death Note will easily fall in love with Promised Neverland. 
They both have characters that are very smart and are very strategical with their plans. These two anime will have you on the edge of your seat wondering what's going to happen next. 
Both have a similar story where the protagonist is extremely smart and both have a kind of cat and mouse chase story 
Amazing mind games, amazing stories, amazing characters. Both are so addictive that make you binge-watch them. "
1535,37999,18,"-Both feature a psychological duel between two main characters in order to achieve an important objective-Both take themselves very seriously during these scenes and feature similar buildups and use of musical scores-Both do an excellent job at developing both their primary and supporting casts, adding to the believability of the environment the story takes place in 
This what happen if Yagami & L reincarnated to romcom anime.Kaguya is very similar to Yagami. The color theme, evil expression style, also she is manipulative, will do anything to accomplish her goal, have advantage and exploit it.Meanwhile, Miyuki her rival bit similar to L too, he is more smart than her, but have less advantage position. 
Both titles are about the psychological warfare between two characters. They feature the mind games of two strong protagonists who will make you root for both of them at the same time. Obviously Kaguya-sama is a romance based mind game, while Death Note is a detective series. 
Both are series involving battles of wits between two geniuses from different parts of society who really, really, really want to go to bone town on each other.  
Two different geniuses who engage in a dramatic mental battles with one another, with incredibly unrealistic yet entertainingly complex and over the top strategy. 
While having contrasting tones, both shows heavily focus on mind games and psychological warfare between the 2 protagonists into confessing (literally in Kaguya-sama, figuratively in Death Note) 
Both series involve a battle of wits in which their two protagonists engage in a fierce struggle to outdo each other, with the main difference being that Kaguya-sama takes a more comedic approach. The main characters are well-developed and viewers will occasionally find themselves cheering for both sides.  
Both Kaguya-sama and Death Note have a mental game between two great minds. 
The comparison might be a little odd but both manga involve a lot of mind games and intelligent characters trying to trick eachother just unlike Death Note Kaguya sama is all about romance. So if you are interested in a Death Note without the philosophy but love instead this is the manga for you. 
Both series contains battle of wits between the main casts. Kaguya is more comedic in tone, whereas Death Note is more mature. The main duo of each series are well developed and likable.  
They're an intense psychological battle in between the minds of our main two protagonists who are both smart and cunnng. They think of every possible decision and what can go wrong if they choose the wrong option. They also try and get the other person to admit to something that is important to the story. One difference is that one is a romantic comedy, while the other is a psychological thriller. 
Two smart characters attempt to outwit each other throughout the show. 
Kaguya sama is, like one user has noted, the lighthearted rom-com adaptation of Death Note. The battle of the minds, but instead of a global scale of death and destruction, of two student council members.  
This might look weird, to compare this two shows, but Kaguya-sama shows what would happen if L and Yagami fell in love. Both characters try to “hunt down” each other. However, Kaguya-sama as a very light, comedy, funny tone. Not so dark as Death Note 
Most was already saidIt's weird but Kaguya definitely has Death Note vibes, that's while those shows are completely different in tone. They don't actually have much in common, exept one big nuance- Both are focused around characters, that think a lotIn Death note there were lots of smart thoughts, in Kaguya there was a lot of fun ""overthinking"" 
Kaguya-sama is the more lighthearted romantic comedy version of the more darker toned Death Note. We have 2 brilliant minded people trying to catch one another, one anime is for the purpose of confessing love while the other is for the purpose of bringing the other down by their sense of justice. We have Kaguya who is the Light Yagami of the series, a very cunning, manipulative character who is one step ahead of her rival and using every advantage at her will to make rival confess to her. And lastly we have Shirogane, the Lawliet L of the series who even though he is the smarter than his rival, he is at a disadvantage but is always the one closer to make Kaguya finally break and confess.While Kaguya-sama is satirically using the tropes of psychological animes to create humorous moments and this subversive use of a conventional serious thrillers ends up making for a great tool to tell its story in a new and unique way. The same techniques that worked great for psychological thrillers such as Death Note read more 
If you like a masterpiece like Death Note, then you might also like Kaguya-sama wa kokurasetai. Both anime titles include a battle of wits, in which two characters are fighting a tough fight to surpass each other, Kaguya-sama is more comedic and funny anime, with a school theme, and Death Note has a more mystical and serious atmosphere, I recommend that you watch kaguya sama wa kokurasetai, you will definitely like it, I'm sure! 
kaguya is actually light vs l but with straight relationship and more funnyboth using brains to make the others loseMisa looks like chika but chika is more useful and cute "
1535,9253,15,"Both animes are about the main characters trying to change the world through unnatural means (Death Note / time travel). The protagonists Light and Okabe are both geniuses, but while Light is a self-confident evil mastermind, Okabe is a good-hearted 'self-proclaimedly mad' scientist with a fair bunch of ridiculous inventions. Both have clever plotlines that will always keep you on attention and at the edge of your seat, wanting to learn more. 
Steins;Gate are similar in the way that they both require critical thinking and your absolute attention for a clear understanding of what is really going on. Both these anime""s are dark, though Steins;Gate starts of with a lot of humour.Also, the voice actor of the main characters are indeed the same. 
Death Note and Steins Gate are very close in nature, you got the whacked out kind of genius in both series, and both main characters love playing with fire (figuratively speaking). If you're looking for an anime that has psychological thrills and don't feel like watching all of code geass these are some good options. 
I am a big fan of animes that require intelligent thinking, whilst the plots are not even similar, they both have a large sense of mystery as well as the ability to engage your mind! Both insanely brilliant animes that you're missing out on if you haven't watched them! Highly recommend on both sides. 
Both shows have characters of great intelligence. Both have characters that mess the laws of nature. DN with a god and this Steins;gate with a time machine. Finally, both shows aren't very gory. They show blood on occasion, however it isn't everywhere and their deaths aren't shown. In my own opinion, they are very interesting shows. Each have unique characters that makes the shows what they are, and I enjoyed them.  
Both series share a unique kind of way of looking at things. 
Both take place in present-day Tokyo and the protagonists of both rely on strategic thinking in order to accomplish their goals, chiefly by discovering and exploiting the rules of their newfound devices. Both also cover similar themes, such as ""be careful what you wish for"" and the ethical implications of a human having control over supernatural powers (for Death Note, it's whether one should have control over life and death; for Steins;Gate, it's whether one should have control over time).  
Ones a little more SciFi, the other is a little more Fantasy.  Either way, chances are, if you like Death Note you will like Steins Gate.Both center around brilliant, eccentric individuals who are tasked with unraveling mysterious occurrences.Steins Gate is a little more light hearted with more lovable characters; But, both have HIGHLY engaging plots for the curious sleuth or scientist in all of us. 
Can you change or hack the world? Or self-destruction without salvation.Both have very similar atmospheres and intelligent characters. Suspenseful and heavy dialogues.Light and Okabe want to change each worlds. Because of they have definite and faith purposes. So they never give up.In DN case, social issues are main theme. Psychological battle is unfold with supernatural elements. Extremely intense.On the other hand, SG is main story for save people. Everything is exist between morality and decision. Like reasoning.It is difficult to achieve something. However, if you have strong will, you can surely change someone's future.Yes. Don't look back past. Future is bright symbol for shine earth. These are personal opinion. But I'm sure them.That's why DN and SG are masterpieces. Not to mention regarding quality, and quite interesting content.Once again, I love both of them. As a observer, I hope their stories are pass down through next generations.If you wanna watch related to DN, I definitely recommend SG. Thanks for reading my sentences. read more 
The two anime are thriller wich have a lot of suspense. 
If you like the mind game aspect of Death Note I think you'll love Steins Gate. Bear with the series. This is one serie that starts out extremely slow. But just have faith. It gets really good. The start feels horribly slow, boring and meaningless. But in the end you will get why it's buildt like that. It will all make sense if you have the patience to get through the start. And when I mean start I mean the first 7-8 episodes.  
really gets your mind going, both are thrillers if you like the genre. 
Both shows excel in making you feel smart. (Big Brain Moments)Both shows become incredibly dark fast.  
Botha re OG great animes which have a great storyline and is very fun too watch 
they both have big brain plots and keep you on the edge of your seet when the action gets good "
1535,22535,12,"Both shows:*Produced by Madhouse.*Main characters are accompanied by a being that is outside of their ''normal'' world.*Main characters hide their secret from everyone else.*People having ''mysterious deaths'',  although the causes are different in each show. Although there are many differences, they are both great if you enjoy series with good quality and dark undertone. 
Both animes have a premise, death note being the death note, and parasyte being the parasyte. Both shows have characters that build and develop around this premise. which in turn also creates a thicken plot and interesting set pieces of story.   
In both shows the main character stumbles upon a supernatural power and has to hide it from everyone. He uses that power for what he thinks it's good for humanity. He also is accompanied by a cynical supernatural being that comes with that power and he is mostly the only one who can speak to it. These are dark, psychological shows and have a very similar atmosphere. 
I really found my self that i was rewatching Death Note with different Plot. Like1) Cops are suspected of Light for being **** (censored) , same case for protagonist of Parasyte.2) Human are being killed in both anime and cops are trying to solve it.3) Shinigami Ryuk can be seen in terms of Migi (Parasyte, right hand of Shinichi) that no one know but him for both cases. 
Both shows have similar dark tones. They have some supernatural element connected to main characters who have to keep it secret.  
The same studios. Both characters have something to hide from other people and both feel psychological stress. Same atmosphere and dark tones. 
Similar style and narrative structures.  
Both have very interesting plots that are thought-provoking. Both anime are REALLY good and are a big name for a reason. Both are great from beginning to end. Both have some hilarious moments in them! 
They both tell the story of a male high school student acquiring the titular power, which belongs to a supernatural being who proceeds to guide/support the protagonist as he uses this immense power with good intentions, with said power gradually and radically changing him. He keeps his power a secret from most people and is hunted after because of his association to it. He consequently gets increasingly involved with the police.With this same premise, they convey such different stories, as each anime has a power, a set of characters, and a progression, that is unique to their respective anime.Additionally, both anime come from studio Madhouse. 
Both stories follow someone who suddenly comes into possession of an extraordinary power.  Both protagonists fight to conceal their powers from others, while using the powers for various reasons.  Both anime's also aim to make you question your values and morals as a human, which I found interesting.  Both anime's also have an element of investigation of sorts.  Death Note has a lot more involvement with the police, but Parasyte has a decent amount as well.  My first recommendation, but I couldn't help feeling like the two were similar as I was watching Parasyte.  
Both series have a rather low amount of ""randomness"" where foreign elements are added to the story that completely change the course of the story and could feel very unnatural and unnecessary to some people, people who like their stories to have a fair conflict with believable progression from point to point will probably enjoy both series.  
Graced by alien. Death Note and Parasyte both follow a high schooler who ends up in getting paired with an unearthly existence. In this period, the students must stay undercover from the looming threats these unearthly beings have given.DN has Light take one of Ryuk's death notes, thus, becoming a serial killer. Parasyte has Shinichi having a parasite, Migi, live within him.Both are good anime featuring the same character progressions. Though DN is a supernatural, Parasyte is sci-fi. Both brought to you by the same studio Madhouse. "
1535,31043,12,"Both are anime about how to find the criminal among usual people and to prove his guilt. Also, both have supernatural moments, though Boku is a smarter one. 
Death Note and Boku dake ga Inai Machi both deal with the matter of death and feature detective-style mystery. In particular, they share the same dark feel in both animation style and plot, though Death Note is undoubtedly even darker. If you liked that side of ERASED, then you will like Death Note as much, if not more :)  
A highly strategic killer who seems too skilled to ever get caught is confronted by possibly the only person ever capable of catching them. One of them also has a supernatural ability which may give them an edge over the other.Both anime have a pretty dark tone to them and keep you at the edge of your seat wondering what's going to happen next. They also give you the feel of a constant battle going on between the hero and the killer where even the slightest mistake could have drastic consequences. Although Erased doesn't show the conflict directly from the killer's perspective, you can tell how the actions of the main character force the killer to alter his plans behind the scenes. read more 
Both of them have a really cathing story with supernatural things and murderer in them. 
They're both physcological and they're a mix of both realistic and mythical worlds; for example, Shinigamis aren't proven to exist and neither is a Death Note but yet it is set in a normal, everyday world. This is similar to how Erased is set in a normal world with a typical urban atmosphere but Fujinuma's revival ability gives it a mythical twist.  
Similar subject matter (murder mystery with a supernatural element) handled in a fresh, intelligent way. Both shows give a chance for the viewer to try and work out the mystery alongside the characters rather than simply witholding information until a critical reveal.  
Both are dark psychological murder thrillers that will leave you wanting to binge on each episode with every plot twist that comes.  Both MC's are very intelligent and watching their plans come to fruition is putting a puzzle together piece by piece.  Both are full of internal dialogue from the MC to help you become fully immersed in their stories and motivations.  For being full of plot twists, both shows have good rewatchability as you pick up little things you may have missed during your previous watch through.  Both also have very good english dubs, if you prefer watching it that way. read more 
if you like Boku dake ga Inai Mach you definitely like death note. It will give you thrills. You will have so much of intense and you will be so much of curious after every episode.  It's worth to watch it. 
Both shows have a powerful yet short and flowing story. That being said they both also have a kind of disappointing ending, but it's whatever.  
Hunt for the serial killer. Though Death Note and Erased both have differing stories, they both follow people who hunt for a particular serial killer in order to stop them from their rampages.Both anime are dark mystery anime with Death Note containing tons of mind games and Erased being lighter and condensed in comparison to Death Note. 
They are both about a detective trying to find the murderer, and in both animes there's a really good suspense and often the detective or the murderer already know the next steps that the other is going to take/choose. 
Both are Mystery, trying to find a suspect in a cat-and-mouse type chase, with Erased being more on the Supernatural side, but still a great series to watch nonetheless. "
1535,820,9,"There are definitely parallels between the main four geniuses that become engaged in mind-game warfare in Death Note and Legend of the Galactic Heroes; to such an extent that it's very possible for LotGH to have been an inspirational factor for DN's author. On one side you have pampered pretty boys (Light and Reinhard) that ALWAYS seem to hold all the cards and have events play out in their favour. Their handsome appearances and manipulative abilities are used to their advantage. On the other, you have pure geniuses (L and Yang) that have to contend with never having the advantage due to their circumstances and never being able to fight on an even playing field. One is eccentric, while the other is lazy and has no desire for warfare of any kind--both failing to appeal in terms of social skills (mainly L, although Yang is also clumsy in this regard) / politically.There are differences, however. DN has Light and L get to know each other up close and personal as their mental battle plays out. LotGH, on the other hand, only has its leads meet ONCE in its 110 episode entirety: Reinhard and Yang battling it out at a distance by commanding space fleets against each other and making assumptions based on what little they know about each other. The mind-games having a third factor - circumstance - that pushes the plots in the required directions is too obvious to ignore. Also: successors continuing the battle. read more 
The setting is very different, but the way the show works out is similar. Instead of an intellectual battle between a detective and a god child, Legend of the Galactic Heroes has an intellectual battle between two fleet commanders, each fighting for their own version of justice. It's up to the viewer to decide who's really correct, in the end. 
Both feature genius' who fight primarily with their minds and the use of psychological warfare. Both shows tend to focus on the lead opponents and, therefore, treat other characters like supporting ones.The opponents also stand for different morals/beliefs and winning or losing means EVERYTHING.Death Note tends to cheapen human worth exchange for very addicting storytelling.Galactic Heroes takes a more natural approach to it's story, emphasizing on outcomes, what each side fights for; and HOW they can fight for it.It takes it's time developing situations, doesn't use otherworldly elements as an additive, and contains a very human soul. 
Both animes are very similar to each other. In both animes you óbserve two opposing factions who are trying to outwit the other. The basic idea is the same, whereas the rules and conditions might be a tad different. If you liked one of these, i honestly can not see a reason for you to not like the other. 
both anime have two geniuses fighting against each other for their principles  
Both deal with a battle of wits, although LOGH is on a much bigger scale. 
LoGH is the grandfather of genius vs. genius, battle of the wits genre of anime. 
Two highly intelligent protagonists with different views on how the world should be fight each other. Not physically, but with their intellect, through strategy and mind games. In Death Note it's more clear who the bad guy is while in Legend of the Galactic heroes both sides have legitimate arguments and it's more up to the reader to choose which one to support. Then again, some readers choose to support the evil side in Death Note anyway. 
These anime both feature genius protagonists who try to outwit each other. There is also no set antagonist so the viewer can decide whose ideals are correct.  "
1535,16498,8,"Both have a dark, gritty atmosphere. The main characters are interesting, and very well-developed. Death lurks behind every corner in both anime, and the Japanese voice acting is professional. Make sure to check them both out, as they both are really good and stay true to the manga. 
At first glance it might seem stupid, but these two shows are directed by the same director, so they are at the same level exciting, entertaining and enjoyable. Also they are very memorable. 
Both got gore, if you like either one you would love the other one. both have got adventure mystery and fighting.  
Both series bring alot of human emotion into it and both will bitch slap you at moments when you thought hope was lost. 
Both are awesome shounen, thriller and mystery animes. Shingeki No Kyojin / Attack on Titan just has more action. The thrill just gives me goosebumps everytime. These animes are a must watch! 
A cold world. Some worlds are so damned, that those who haven't even passed high school feel the need to go out of their way to change the world. Death Note and Attack on Titan are no expectations, protagonists who understand the cold and dark world end up using what have their strength in a means to change the order of how things work.Death Note having Light become a serial killer, in an attempt to become the 'God of the New World' by ridding evil from the earth. AOT having childhood friends: Eren, Mikasa, and Armin join the survey crops to slay all titans after Eren's mom died from a titan.Both are great anime for the shounen demographic, with Death Note being a mystery psychological featuring mind games, AOT being and action-military featuring all-out carnage. Either way, a ton of 'the enemies' perish. read more 
Both are darker and more serious shonen series that have focus on the psychology of their characters.

1535,30,6,"While it wouldn't seem they have much in common i felt both were amazingly deep and both kept me interested all the way through and made me have this feeling like ""This is awesome."" 
Well the main story does not have nothing in common. However both have a high psychological side. Maybe Death Note don't touch you as much as Neon Genesis Evangelion, but stills a great anime and will certainly worth your watching. Both also focus in the ""God"" word, but in different perspectives. :)Death Note focus more in a psychological fight, and NGE in feelings and unique characters.Ending, I would also say that both touch the theme ""change the world"". 
both will leave you thinking.trust me, if you liked one you will most probably like the other. 
Complex and interesting plot with many twists. 
HUGE amount of psychological disturbance, especially as the stories progress. It may not be evident for the first 4-5 episodes, but it requires a large amount of memory talent and controlled thinking to process what's going on. If you don't like it, it's likely because you don't GET it. If you can't get it, read spoilers, it's no shame to do so. All in all, these are both SUPERB anime. 
The fact that Death Note needs to be:1.Seen more than once to fully grasp the intricacies of actions, and the heavily focused mind battles of twisted magnitudes of complexity.2.Forces you to concentrate on the text and dialogue going on, or else,easily makes it a strong recommendation to Neon Genesis Evangelion universe.Both are a masterpiece on their own  "
1535,2966,4,"Spice and Wolf is the Death Note of romance anime.  You have a similar plotting protagonist - not one who's out to rule the world, but rather the marketplace.  If you enjoyed the ""out-thinking my opponents"" and ""conceiving and executing a plan in the face of adversity"" of Death Note, Spice and Wolf will give you more of the same.In addition, both have supernatural companions who have enhanced senses that help them in their plotting.  Light, however, isn't in love with Ryuk =p 
Both feature a god dropping from the sky and forming a partnership with a mortal young man and both main characters use their wits and intelligence to overcome any obstacle.  
The only thing similar about these anime, and the reason i loved them both, is because they cause you to think about certain events rather than just mindlessly watching it. 
These 2 require a whole lotta thinking in order to understand what the hell the characters are talking about.  Also, both of them have 2 story arcs that make up the entirety of the anime.  Some fast-paced and climactic moments are included as well. "
1535,13125,4,"These shows do touch on dark themes such as power-abuse, betrayal, crimes, and deaths, giving them a mystery and psychological thriller feel, along with tragedy, so I feel they may be similar in that way. 
Both concern the morals of killing people deemed bad for society. 
Both series offer a debate on morals, death, and human nature. They both also show the effects of supernatural powers given to humanity. 
-The problem and issue that arises during the anime is always a food for thought and question to ponder.-It evokes a lot of uncomfortable and uneasy topics.- villain in both anime are similar as they both are intelligence and willingly to sacrifices other people to achieve their goal.- both anime are rather dark.- both anime question the very nature of human.- superpower is available in both anime.- Story-telling is the main attraction point for both anime .- Both anime actually worth your time to watch. "

They're both mindblowing good. They have some similarities in psychological thinking and plottwists. They have similar characters who are extremely smart or skilled at stuff. I highly recommend both of them. They both have (almost) no boring ep whatsoever. 
in terms of the plot they arent really similar but they both entail the theme of strategy and planning "
1535,11741,3,"Both series have a protagonist with a determined way for victory. Death note has more mind battles, while Fate/zero has more fights. 
I have seen people comparing Light Yagami and Lelouch Lamperouge but to me, these two guys aren't similar at all.But on the other hand, the main character of Fate/Zero Kiritsugu Emiya, is really similar to Light. They both are emotionless, dark, have ambitions to create a better world and know that trivial things won't change the world. The only ting that these two characters have different is that Light has a god complex and Kiritsugu doesn't. So, if you like Fate/Zero, I think you would like Death Note as well, especially if you are a Kiritsugu fan. 
Finally a smart show for smart anime watchers "
1535,5114,3,"The ""chained"" events is a common feature in both of the animes and do drive you to think. They share Tragedy and happiness moments that are somehow alike (it's like a projection from the world of fullmetal into the world of death note). 
They are both methodical. They make you think and try and figure things out as you go.  You never know what will happen next. 
Both stories are well-written and neither feel the need to fall back on fanservice or raw action to keep the viewer's attention. Though Fullmetal Alchemist has much more action than Death Note, I'd recommend the two to any fan of deep, enthralling story-lines "

Clashing ideologies. Death Note and Dr. Stone both have a great representation of what a good clash in ideals look like. With Death Note, L seeks out to destroy Kira for his controversial killings. With Dr. Stone Tsukasa finds Senku a threat to his ideals of what a good world would be like, though this clash is more of a sub-genre.Death Note and Dr Stone give intelligent MCs an interesting mind battle to determine the future of the world. However, unlike Death Note, Dr. Stone gives more of an adventure with action and comedy on the side. 
masterminds fight for humanity, both have a different view of making a good society. Both animes are based on science related stuff. "
1535,467,3,"Dig out your sleuth hats. Both series follow a plot that is very challenging to figure out. While Ghost in the Shell has a greater focus on action, Death Note and GitS share the ability to baffle with plot twists and complex schemes. 
Both series' stories involve very deep, intellectual concepts and the plot twists, in particular, are amazing.  While GitS has far more filler than Death Note, both series almost always focus on crime and/or the psychology and rationale of the people who drive the stories forward.  Also, they both have absolutely stunning art styles. 
Both have the same psychological roller-coaster of a cat and mice chase. "

Both have moments of thinking/monloguing, puzzle-solving, strategy, and cat-and-mouse games. 
These two anime are directed by Madhouse studios and are composed with Yoshihisa Hirano. Funny enough, I feel that these two share a bit in common in terms of psychological depth and anguish. The Yorknew arc feels especially similar to the plot of Death Note and both tend to have a bit of religion and prophecy involved. Some seiyuus also share roles in these two anime (i.e. Mamoru Miyano with Light Yagami and Chrollo Lucilfer). "

Both of these shows start off as engaging, gritty crime dramas that pull you in during the first couple of episodes, and carry on through the first half of season with solid character developments. They both feature genius street-smart characters on both sides of their conflicts that approach situations in refreshing ways to the viewer, while still feeling like solid characters from an emotional perspective as well.After the first half, however, both of these shows fall flat in their own ways. Banana Fish declines in quality through its over-integration of too many anime cliches and slapstick humor that conflicts with its previously-established atmosphere; and Death Note through its infamous plot twist that left much of that character development hanging in its final act. read more "

1535,10087,2,"Both of these shows involve a ridiculous amount of plotting and tactical gambits. They both take place in a modern day setting, but both have a supernatural element involved. Fate/Zero has a lot more major characters and different motivations whereas Death Note has a 1v1 feel, but there is a life-and-death competition in both and plenty of suspense as you wonder what the characters have up their sleeve next. 
Death Note and Fate/Zero. These two anime series had such an effect on me; I don't know where to begin. First off, both these shows had a huge impact on me and my morals. They made me think of life and the lives of others as well as the true definition of ""justice"" or if you prefer, ""hero."" Both series kept me on the edge of my seat like nothing I've seen before. They still come to mind when I make moral/everyday decisions, and they both plunge frightfully deep into the results of what we think is the right choice.Moving away from the final message of the stories, the two relate in many more ways than what I have already described. The most noticeable similarity, besides, of course, the in-depth exploration of human nature, is probably the main characters. In both shows, the main protagonist is not truly defined until the end. In addition, both the antagonist and the main protagonist are seemingly evenly matched in levels of skill and intellect and fight each other in battles of wits. They each use their resources to the fullest, and slowly figure each other out as the series progress. They counter each other's moves almost exactly, and rival each other until the end. This is seen in each show, whether it be L vs Light, or Kirei vs Kiritsugu—they each spend most of the show figuring out their opponents' next move and planning ahead for their own.Another similarity, moving back toward the moral aspect of the shows, is the whole idea of ""saving the world."" This is seen in both series, and of course really digs deep into the cause and affect of this sort of mindset. It totally explores the idea in-depth, the individual definition of the expression, and then exploits the efforts of the characters in pursuit of this ultimate goal in order to teach the viewer an important lesson. Both shows employ an extensive pursuit of this goal, and what is resorted to in order to attain this goal. They emphasize the results of the journey and the final destination of the pursuit, which is most definitely not what was originally expected or hoped for.""In any case,"" as L would say, both series are some of my all-time favorites and I highly recommend both. They are truly life-changing, and if you enjoyed one, you will most definitely like the other. read more "

-They both deal with the supernatural-They are both action packed and more violent and disturbing than your typical Shonen Jump anime-They both have fun sets of characters-The characters constantly have to fight against dangerous and evil supernatural creatures  
Jujutsu Kaisen is basically Kimetsu no Yaiba, but better. They both focus on a young man who reluctantly joins a group that fights supernatural beings (demons for KnY, curses for JJK), but:- Jujutsu Kaisen has a stronger main cast (writing and personality wise)- Jujutsu Kaisen has a more unique and fleshed out power system with more creative uses- Kimetsu no Yaiba REALLY drags in the first few arcs before it starts getting good. Jujutsu Kaisen is good from the beginning.- Jujutsu Kaisen doesn't have Zenitsu in it (instantly better) 
- They both are fighting demons- They both include the genre of shonen- Badass chracters that are selfless and really strong from the start 
Both the anime have the same theme, killing demon/curses. A protagonist who can fight, a badass who looks out for him and a major objective. This just reminded me of Demon slayer so much.  
Some similar aspects include the genre of shonen , fighting off monsters/curse, and the main character is selfless and starts their journey with high potential in strength. 
- both protagonists were forced into this 'new world' due to a tragic event- both protagonists have that 'be good for the sake of it' vibe- wise playful mentor figure (who ultimately seems like a second father of some sort)- antagonists considered to be otherworldly beings- family ties into their motivation for 'being the best'chances are that if you like one of them, you'll probably like the other 
Both anime's are fighting demons and monster in order to keep peace in japan. 
Jujutsu Kaisen is Demon Slayer but good 
Both protagonists are thrown in a similar situation, dragged into the world of fighting and eventually the protagonists join an organization to fight against the evil of humanity. Both have high quality animation and great music, they also try to add a bit of comedy!  
Great art style / animation and badass characters fighting monsters 
- Both are about fighting demons- Both have good animation- Give off similar vibes- Both are hyped or have the potential to be hyped up 
Both are really popular shows that are easy to get into and that successfully integrate a lot of Japanese culture. Both have amazing animation and are beautiful to watch. 
Jujutsu Kaisen (jjk) is actually better than Demon Slayer, including mature scences and great animation of jjk is actually worth it,Give it a watch, Already watched? So like me 
Both have very interesting first episodes. There are cool loveable side characters but what makes them different is that there is a major villian in KnY whilst JK probably will have minor ones as far as I know. 
both have great animation and a not too complex story 
they both fighting demons and having a funny moment on some scene the differences is demon slayer comedy always after fight and jujutsu comedy are before to mid fight other similarity:-both have very good opening and ending-same vibe 
Jujutsu Kaisen is pretty much a underrated Demon Slayer/Kimetsu no Yaiba. If you like animes about demons or like fights, give Jujutsu Kaisen a shot. 
both involve fighting creatures like demons and curses. they also don't have character development because they just rush recklessly into a fight for the rights of others. their mc would do anything to protect others and their loved ones. overall i love both animes. definitely recommended :]

Both anime has a fight between humanity and Titans/Demons. Bigger enemy is scary, strong and hard to defeat, but there are groups dealing with them. Demon slayers and Survey Corps. Then we have naive main character who looses people that are important to him. Lots of tears, screaming and trying to make things better. Few years of training to become a man and then the MC is out to destroy them all.

While watching kimetsu no Yaiba I got attack on Titan vibesBoth of them has a stunning visuals but being honest I liked the visuals of kimetsu no Yaiba then attack on Titan Just watch this anime u won't be disappointed  
It's not all that similar other than the protagonist grows through tragedy and finds power hidden within him and all the simple yet effective cliche's. Also both are about killin' baddies 
The premise of the whole story is almost the same for both of these. Both have : a MC whose family gets eaten, some sort of organization that fights the creatures, revenge themes, a character(/s) who is a creature, but helps humanity, etc. The biggest difference that I can see is the fact that Shingeki no Kyojin gets more and more political as it goes on (it covers politically based issues and conflicts). I don't see that happening with Kimetsu no Yaiba. 
both are the same tells the adventures of the main character that is full of emotions and blood in the initial episode 
Shingeki no Kyojin and Kimetsu no Yaiba has its similarities, the main one being the idea of humans vs a supernatural creature. It's humans vs titans and demons, respectively. Both creatures have only a certain way of killing them which makes both series amusing and on your toes. Also, the concept of a supernatural creature helping and killing its own kind is also very relevant in both series and enjoyable to watch. "

They make up for their disadvantages in other ways like brute strength or toughness.-The protagonists have survived tragic backstories.-In both fmab and kny, the protagonists are sent to different locations on their journey to save their siblings, giving the shows a nice, adventurous feel.

Both helps his brother or his sister back to human.Tanjiro helps his sister Nezuko demon back to human and Edward Elric helps his brother Alphonse to bring his body back. 
When you watch either, then you are likely drawn in by the very concept of the main character's drive. To right the wrong done to their family as they explore an intriguing world with concepts you will come to understand. Both series ends up challenging these stalwart characters on their quest to find the solution to a seemingly hopeless situation.Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood takes a more loose approach, giving these characters time to explore this world and try to understand exactly what it is they are trying to find: the philosopher stone.Demon Slayer takes a more methodical approach giving the solution very clearly, but a most difficult task. Having the main antagonist, the final boss, reverse the issue. Thus, the main character trains to face off his underlings to eventually reach the final boss.While the concepts do differ, their approach to the concept has many similarities due to these main characters.* There is a goon squad under the main enemy.* Their quest is a seemingly hopeless one.* There are various superpower concepts to learn as the story progresses.* They face hardship due to the issue that caused the characters to go on a quest.* Silly things happen sometimes to humanize the main characters, i.e. they aren't aloof robotic edgelords.So, with these in mind, you'll be able to find yourself drawn into each for the same reasons. read more 
Both series have an older brother, who goes to hell and back to save their younger sibling turn back to a human. They also have a strong focus on character and share a similar tone.  
Both series follow 2 siblings after tragedy strikes, struggling to reassemble their lives. They both have a darker somewhat realistic tone to your typical shounen with fairly intelligent likable leads.One thing I find quite striking are these little moments of empathy the protagonists shares with their enemies due to their similarities with the protagonist's sibling.In both series, the elder brother works for a government like organization. As a result, they must travel all over the country as they look for the cure to return their siblings to how they once were. 
Both stories are centered on two brothers. The goals of both animes aim at the recovery of the younger brothers, in the FMAB the body of Alphonse and in Demon Slayer the humanity of Nezuko.There are incredible battles and powerful villains, as well as a lot of blood in the fights.

7785,1210,25,"Fans of both have drawn many parallels between the two shows. They're similar in that they are both semi-episodic comedy-drama with similar themes. The MC is a depressed young man trying to cope with the failures of his life, and is surrounded by weird people. Dark, depressing and slightly psychedelic, they're both great shows, and although not very similar, one will remind you of the other.  
Welcome to the NHK is far more depressing than Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei while the later adds a smidgen of bizzaro metaphysics to the later episodes. However they both revolve around a group of oddball people loafing around while helping the main character deal with the failures of his life, in their own way. Not always succesfully. 
Both are based on a human-failure-type character to make up an interesting story and teach us life lessons (only highly-aware viewers can actually learn, though). 
Both shows talk about a despairing life. Youjouhan Shinwa Taikei focuses on a college campus life while Welcome to the NHK focuses on a drop out and a high school girl. Welcome to the NHK differs by extrapolating psychological themes while Taikei focused on humor, but they all talk about the same thing: socializing is beneficial to life. 
Both are episodic shows with protagonists who need to take charge of their lives and both get trippy in the process, though NHK is much darker. 
The main reason why I believe these two to be similar, is the feeling that you get after completing the show, especially the last few episodes of it. As a college student myself these shows made me stop and think about where I am at this point of my life. It's actually pretty damn inspiring. 
Both follow a college aged shut-in through his episodic adventures as he struggles through everyday problems such as social skills, success, love, libido, and finding your place in the world. 
Both tell a story about a loser in life. Both also have a same kind of dark humor style.Difference is just that Tatami Galaxy feels like NHK on drugs. Dialogue goes bulletspeed and animation is ""inconsistent"" and trippy. In a good way. 
The truth is, no other anime comes close to what Welcome to the NHK was. But this one comes the closest.Tatami Galaxy is not as depressing, more artsy, and has higher production value.  
Both follow adult characters discontent with their lives , and their coming to terms with their issues. Both make use of visual storytelling, though Takei does it more often and more explicitly. Takei is a bit more philosophical, and perhaps harder to grasp than NHK. I really like how they take a more realistic approach to the characters' issues instead of a more idealistic one.  
Both anime are about the psyche from the main character and the story is told in a more semi-episodic way. Also the Genre are nearly the same. Both anime have a high psychological level but still keeps in touch with a huge bottle of good jokes and hilarious Character Interactions.Also they use some surreal elements to represent the psyche for a more comprehensible way.As a psychological fan you should definitely watch both shows. 
Both shows deal with a college aged boy's coming of age story. Both highlight themes such as loneliness and cosmic irony. They both feature some of the best story telling I have ever encountered (not just in anime, but in general) and are, ultimately, love stories.  
Both of these series have a great story, are set in modern day and have characters that are very much like real humans. 
Enclosed in your room or on your tatami. Protagonists who want to escape their reality, the life they have borne for years, the mistakes they have had, because of situations that seem to have resulted from a ""conspiracy"" or a ""curse."" In addition, they explore different lifestyles of which they always seek to fit in spite of their weaknesses, but only with the opportunity that can be close to them, they can get what they have always wanted. 
It hurts knowing that things could've been different if different choices were made. These anime blame some type of entity for their own faults in life. While ""The Tatami Galaxy"" focuses on the could've, would've, and should've scenarios, ""Welcome to the NHK"" focuses on rehabilitating the social aspect of giving up on life. Life lessons are taught throughout the shows. 
Both have a feeling of melancholy where everyone feels like there putting on a happy face when there dying inside. Everyone has there own problems is a message both shows convey 
Both are beautiful journeys of young men trying to find a purpose of their lives. 
While Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei (also known as Tatami Galaxy) is very different as it is nowhere near as depressing as NHK ni Youkoso (nor is it supposed to be) they are similar in how they look at the effects of life choices, and can be very real and relatable. Art direction is also similar at times, as Tatami Galaxy uses a bit of surrealism and psychadelic scenes to help tell its story. 
Both are psychological anime that are extremely unique & make you reevaluate life. If you only watch shounen these probably aren't for you.  
 Both shows are both Comedy and Drama, while dealing with similar psychological themes of a protagonist and all his failures. Both also have a rather psychedelic vibe and feature weird, but at times depressing characters. 
If you liked tatami galaxy, you will like this story of regret, time, anxiety, depression 
-they have protagonists with similar personalities.-they are both dramedies about antisocial people. 
Both protagonists are flawed and prominent themes of failure, opportunity and depression are depicted. Has an emphasis on decision and taking one's own initiative rather then being stagnant and not progressing. 
Both provide perspective on life after high school. They are about doing something meaningful with your time. NHK deals with a shut-in NEET while Tatami Galaxy focuses on being in college. 
NHK and tatamy are historis that talk about maturation, maybe by different methods and with different themes but both stories tell us the story of a young adult with a certain immaturity, trying to advance and become better people, they are stories that speak to us of what is the maturation and facing reality with a very good conclusion in both, also both stories have an attractive design, with charismatic and endearing characters as well as a peculiar sense of humor, both works are the best the industry has been able to offer us and without doubt they are two works that are worth seeing. "
7785,5081,20,"Both are series that aren't necessarily parodies or strict satire. The Tatami Galaxy takes on an extremely mysterious and reflecting tale of ""possibilities"". Bakemonogatari mixes some mild to heavy predicaments with supernatural folklore to help enhance/clarify the significance of said issues.Both have strange, eclectic, abstract art that will undoubtedly impress those with it's usage. Both have and make use of some fine music, but... are paled in comparison to their OPs and ENDs.Both are quite new,  and both set the bar for enjoyment too, as the dialogue and insightful observations will cease to amaze.The Tatami Galaxy's novelty, manner of storytelling, and overlaying mystery is SOO fresh, so enticing, and SOOOOO rewarding that one cannot label it any other name except ""classic"".Of course, one needs to see a few anime ""brain tickles"" first. But, it should work well either way.Bakemonogatari's atmosphere is supplemented with standard anime fare, which will sit well with others, but might dampen the blow on some of the content the show has. Still, it's characters' are a bit more colorful than Tatami's, yet the topic's mixture with supernatural isn't so well done on some occasions. The ending also won't please some. read more 
100% more monologue at 3 times the speed.If you thought you were good with keeping up with Koyomi's monologue in Monogatari, then you need to retest those speed reading skills with The Tatami Galaxy. If you can do that, you'll enjoy it. 
Both have a unique art style and presentation, with emotional tension between the characters. There is an obvious romantic pairing in both series. Both focus on characters and presentation over any other element.  
It seems that we don't see series like these two nowadays but these two anime are highly recommended as they have a cleaver usage of characters, art, and witty dialogue.Both series contains a lot of parody, humor, drama, and among other things. These two series will definitely bring out the enjoyment out of viewers despite its low volume of episodes. Both series are also intelligent and will present anime in its finest form, one that you'll remember for a very long time. 
Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei and Bakemonogatari follow the same basic structure - boy meets girl followed by endless dialogue and surrealistic artstyle. If you enjoyed one, it's safe to say you'll enjoy the other.Bakemonogatari expands upon the fantasy setting, and adds a bucketload of fanservice. In contrast, Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei ups the slice-of-life and about 1000x the words/minute ratio. However, both hold the same charm - or curse - that makes you either love or hate the anime. 
They may be entirely different things , but both provides fast-paced dialogues and sometimes conversation goes really deep. Both focuses on characters more than story itself and have really unique art style.Also both has some mystery in it and romance. 
Interesting Art, Quirky characters, dialogue heavy.  
Happening in relatively small setting yet packed with unusual situations, full of monologuing and dialogues, experimental animation and colorful imaginery. Driven by interractions between characters.  
Both have unique art styles, fast dialogue, and a bit of supernatural. 
A lot of dialouge with extremely difficult to comprehense/dark plot line which will be explained with added romance to the same. Both are succesfully deep. They have different art styles which are actually great with that supernatural and mystery genre which you will love. 
Both share a fast dialogue, which, at times, becomes pretty hard to follow. 
Both works nicely showcases the psychology and comedy genres.Both works have an artsy presentation that fits with their respective narratives and still looks charming even today.Both works include a collection of unique and well crafted narratives that are part of one big picture.Both works contain a cast of colourful characters that all have their own sense of humour and always have a grand story to show and tell. If any one of these characters were removed or never existed, neither these two works will ever be the same (if not, feel awfully incomplete). That’s a given.Both works are very strong on the dialogue department (both length and depth). So a good dose of patience and investment is required, though you’ll be greatly rewarded once your all set. read more 
The Tatami Galaxy, as well as Monogatari, utilize unorthodox and unconventional art and ideas in similar ways to create a show, that is centered around its characters and dialogues between them, with darker themes, as well as slight comedy. 
Both are mind-bending, surreal and artistic that could either make you confuse or be awed.. Both are great anime in terms of story telling. 
Both have a similar plot in the sense of using a daily plot and take it to the next level with a solid narrative, good characters, tie threads excellently, have an excellent artistic direction in the sense of immersion and aesthetics, and load with a strong symbolism and message to whoever sees it. If you like Monogatari it is very likely that you like The Tatami Galaxy. 
Both stories are related to spirit. Lots of dialogue in both, reaaaally fast dialogue, and half of it is philosophical/spiritual/interesting, and half is just total random funny bullcrap. 
Supremely unique art styles and presentation. Equally absurdist. 
Both are anime involving a male character who makes monologues about what is going on in the world around them, whether their world is normal or not.Both also have similar story-telling techniques, with most of the anime consisting of heavy dialogue and strange cuts, angles, with meta, surreal and ""out-there"" humour sprinkled in.The art-styles are both unique from some anime out there which separate them in their unique qualities from other anime.Funny and unique, I think fans of Bakemonogatari would enjoy The Tatami Galaxy as well. 
Both are surreal,aesthethic and abstract. 
If your a Monogatari Fan, then you will love this show. It gives me the feeling ""so similar yet different"". They are so similar the bizarreness, the weirdness, and the comedy they are almost likely similar. I reccommend you to watch it. There is always dangling in front of you, destiny to be exact so why not reach out and grab this anime? "
7785,22135,9,"A quiet protagonist who seem to be bounded with a mysteriously talented friend/demon whom he can't beat. It also have a very obscure animation style and is enjoyable to watch especially if you like 'weird' perspectives. 
Similar art style and art direction. Teaches deep lessons about life. Fun and interesting characters. Has a deep, serious story, but doesn't take itself too seriously. Very psychological. About characters trying to find meaning in life. 
Fans of the trippy artstyle and witty conversations are guaranteed to find something to like in both of these. 
Apathetic main characters with a friend who is a bad influence. Both are slices of life that do not follow the general formula, both in their characters/stories as well as their animation. As for the animation, if you have never watched a Yuasa piece before it may take some getting use to. At first they appear quite simple, but over time prove their depth and attention to detail. 
Masaaki Yuasa directed both of these. Both have a got a lot of visual charm. Most of all, Yuasa's direction understands characters very well, and caters to them. His pacing and tension are always solid.The premises are different, but both are very very character-driven. 
Sharing the same director, Masaaki Yuasa, both employ an unorthodox artstyle to convey powerful character-driven narratives. While they cover entirely different subjects, there is a general shared focus on the growth of the main characters of each respective series. 
The directors are the same, which means that the storytelling is also the same. The characters have similar personalities and the goals are about life. A beautiful story about achieving and finding a purpose. They're very exaggerated in movement and the art styles are similar. The dialouges are witty and always interesting. If you've watched one, definitely check out the other. They're so similar in so many aspects. 
Yuasa at his best! Both have a really similar art-style and are focusing on the characters. Very good psycholigical-series with great dialouges.  
A robot in Tatami Galaxy is symbolic not of heroism as in Masaaki's Ping Pong anime, but a shell that protects an introvert, that defends against the possibility of failure. "
7785,31043,4,"Both anime have to do with time travel and changing the past. tatami galaxy is more comedic and erased is more serious. Both are very enjoyable. 
- Unusual artstyles (Tatami Galaxy is more extreme with regards to that, where as Erased is just a little unconventional when it comes to face designs.)- A dense-feeling plot and well developed world by virtue of the repeated timelines- Repeating storylines (Time skips and different 'routes', a very VN like approach. The time skip is much larger in Erased though.)- Similar themes of fate/destiny and romance- Adult protagonist- Similar OST/music styleTatami Galaxy is more wry humour and very fast dialogue, whereas Erased is more heavy drama and pensive silences.  
Similar looking protagonist....trying to think about the past and changing it. 
Erased and Tatami Galaxy both have a similar protagonist and have a story focused around changing the past. The two show's opening are made by Asian Kung-Fu Generation. Also they both have an amazing character design and voice acting.  "
7785,9253,4,"Both use the concept of different possibilities or realities really well.Steins;Gate is a bit more straightforward sci-fi.The Tatami Galaxy is more surreal. And strange. 
There are multiple time lines, and the main character is currently in the wrong attractor field (where the bad ending always happens) and trying to get to the right one (where he is happy). Also, the main character of Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei sort-of gets Reading Steiner. 
both are really well made, both deal with the butterfly effect and parallel worlds 
  Jumps in the time where each creates a parallel world, where the protagonist is the great affected, but their relationships are not affected by this change. They still exist despite being parallel worlds. The protagonist tries to reach his goal. In Tatami Galaxy this goal is simply to have a color pink life and in Steins;Gate, it is to stop an alleged conspiracy. The issue is how hard it is to get there by shedding their bucles or mental revelations. "
7785,2246,3,"Similar to Kuuchuu Buranko, pretty trippy and you have to infer the story. Once you understand the story it's mindblowing. These are shows that force you to think and really understand what is going on in the show. 
In both series, the art style  and the development is pretty unique. If you liked Mononoke you should really try Yojo-Han 
Although there are little similarities between these two in terms of story or genre (Mononoke is horror/demons while The Tatami Galaxy is comedy), their animation and art style are very unique and top-notch.  If you are looking for great stories paired with great visuals, these two are for you. "
7785,13125,2,"-Incredibly moving stories that force the beholder to question their lives.-Superb management of the timelines in both forces those who watch be incredibly attentive or risk losing important details.-Great for those who love to put two and two together.-Fantastic conclusion. 
They have a really different animation, story and characters. But if you really love the Psychological side of Shinsekai no Yori, then you'll really love Tatami Galaxy as well. They both are really unique anime in the genre of psychological, but still enjoyable "
7785,30,2,"Both are mature shows with complex thinking 
Both are much philosophicals and comtemplative "
7785,6594,2,"Both have very colorful artwork, a hectic pace, and are dialogue-driven. Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei has more of a modern realistic setting than the fantasy Katanagatari, but both are unconventional, humorous, and most of all enjoyable works of art. 
If you loved one, you'd like the other if you enjoyed the following from either anime: a new and different art style, a dialogue-heavy series, a large lovable cast, seemingly repetitive but exciting episodes, and an extremely satisfying ending.The two anime are amazing for audiences who are open and patient enough to watch an unconventional and dialogue-heavy show. The two are especially unique regarding its art, both of which I found spectacular (subject to viewer, of course). There are plenty of interesting and lovable characters in both anime. However, it is important to note that the lead characters do not share many similarities, if any at all. Still, the two are most similar in the sense that each episode seems to be very repetitive, and you're mainly just sitting through each episode enjoying the ride. Despite all of the repetition and action and chaos, there is a very satisfying ending.  read more "
10379,457,2,"Both main characters can see weird creatures, same mystery, and similar plots. Each episode new story new characters.  
Mushishi is very similar in the theme of Natsume Yuujinchou San with creatures that cant be seen by all. There is  similar feeling in the stories natsume and ginko participate.. The deference between them in my opinion is that Natsume Yuujinchou San can appeal to younger fans since it is more relatable since it involves school and has a more goofy feeling to it.. On the other hand Mushishi feels more mature with its lack of comedy. Also Ginko is like a wandering doctor for the supernatural.(It doesnt sound cool i know but cool is not its selling point) "
10379,10408,2,"Not only do Natsume Yuujinchou and Hotarubi no Mori e have the same original creator and similar setting, they are animated by the same studio, with the same director and even the composer is the same. Without any doubt there is more than one that these two would both be liked by the same people.The girl, Hotaru, in Hotarubi no More e and the boy, Takashi (mostly referred to by his family name Natsume), both see demon and spirits and they both befriend them. Both the film and the series play with a melancholic feeling and the relationship between humans and spirits. 
Hotarubi no Mori e and Natsume Yuujinchou are written by Yuki Midorikawa and published by Brain's Base studio, so it's not surprising that both are very similar. Both Natsume and Hotarubi are stories about humans' interaction with youkai.Soft animation, haunting music, heart-wrenching story. To those of you who like bitter-sweet stories about humans and youkai. "
35760,13125,2,"What's the truth of the world? The protagonists in both the series seek the answer to this question. The worldbuilding in these 2 series is unimaginably excellent. These 2 series take place in a world full of secrets and lies. They focus on supernatural mysteries and are deep and highly logical. There are lot of revelations that might leave you shocked. They share a similar eerie and dark atmosphere. It's interesting to see characters make deductions. SNK s3 is waaay better than its prequels. Music is exceptionally excellent. Art and background scenery is awesome. There will be interesting theories and philosophies. 
Similar plotline,An end of promised hero with the beginning of anotherA bit of politicssame shounen main character ,who received huge character development "
28735,12531,17,"Both are based on Josei manga. They have a similar art style, and the characters are somewhat similar. I have a hard time seeing someone enjoy one without enjoying the other. 
Two fantastic historical dramas featuring excellent characters. They each capture their time period wonderfully (the two actually overlap quite a bit for a chunk of Rakugo Shinjuu). Lots of jazz, drama, and a love triangle at the heart of it all. They offer different takes of a somewhat similar premise: Rakugo Shinjuu is much more rooted in the darker things of the human heart, whereas Kids on the Slope tends to be a bit more lighthearted. If you like the history, setting, characters, and mood of one, give the other a try. 
-Both are stories of unlikely friendships built while following a similar passion-The main characters seem like perfect foils of each other, one reserved and one energetic -A bit of a love triangle in both- A similar era, the Shouwa era in Japan, but in a different setting, one in the city and the other in the country Both are beautifully told, emotional stories, and the setting is what I believe to be the decider. Sakamichi angles in more on the  youth wanted to rebel against the stifling authority of this era and express themselves through this foreign music called jazz. Meanwhile, Rakugo Shinju is about artists struggling to hold on to a tradition that is being threatened by a changing world. read more 
The character personality frameworks and interactions are nearly the same. Both for older audiences. Both have a very nice, pristine, slice of life style to them whilst being set in the past. If you want to watch something peaceful that evokes emotion (that comes in many forms), these are the shows for you. 
Stiff, reserved, cold character meets and shares the same passion as expressive, outgoing character. Though they are opposite, they end up developing a very close, brotherly bond. Characters are all complex in their own right. Similar (kind of, not really) romantic complications.  
Both titles are period dramas set in the Shōwa era with a decidedly older (generally female) audience in mind. They both center around a group of artists engaging in a performing art while strengthening their emotional ties to one another. They also have similar aesthetic properties, such as plenty of pastoral Japanese imagery and a focus on body language as the main complement to their expressive animation. Though music serves different purposes in both titles, both titles feature a soundtrack that incorporates a fair share of jazz.  
(as of episode one of Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinju) They are both period dramas based on Josei manga focusing on people learning performing arts.  
both of these animes primarily take place during japan's reconstruction after world war 2, both follow the stories of polar opposites who share a common love for their art form (Rakugo and Jazz). It is no surprise that with the clash of asian and western culture spawns a fertile ground for many art forms to grow and adapt into modern japan. While one series tries to keep the traditional japanese world alive the other is a story immersed in western culture. Both series have a solid main cast of characters and are well worth the time to watch. 
Much like Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu, Sakamichi no Apollon is character driven. It focuses on the daily machinations of its characters and the art form they practice. The time period and tone of both shows are extremely similar and they both have that cool, mature feeling. 
-Character driven-Centring around two boys that are complete opposites-Brash Rowdy Kid and Bookish Quiet Kid become unlikely, begrudging friends-Bit of a love triangle-A little heartwarming, but also heartbreaking -Both shows are based on performance arts Music/ Rakugo-Set in late past Japan-Unique animation-Killer Openings 
They are both stories about two youthful guys and their dreams. Arts are involved. While Sakamichi no Apollon deals with music Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu deals with the art of storytelling (rakugo).Also a bit of romance is involved where the two guys are interested in the same girl.Afaik they are based on jousei manga because women in Japan seem to like stories about guys? I myself as a guy can say: I liked them both because as I guy I also like stories between guys. It's easy to understand the guys' motivations and behaviour even if it seems irrational sometimes.They are both character-driven and the romance does not take a big part of the screentime. It's more about the guys and the relationship between them and the hobby/work that connects them. read more 
Both stories have similar character archetypes, are packed with drama, and take place in a historical setting. The main character of both series are pretty gloomy and serious and have an outgoing troublemaker as their foil.The stories are vastly different, as Sakamichi follows high schoolers in a slice of life setting and Rakugo follows a clearly defined story of a man over the course of his life. However, the characters and overall feel of the series are similar. If you enjoyed one, you'll probably enjoy the other. 
The love for performing arts becomes evident in both Josei anime. Romantic relationships are complex, the characters memorable and authentic – as if they were real people. It's beautiful. 
Both being based off of Josei manga, they a similar feel in that the two protagonists have contrasting personalities; one is conformist, straight-faced and ordered while the other is unruly, wild and unconventional. Both sets of protagonists have a strong bond that intertwines with an accompanying third female character, helping to progress the plot as well as their respective relationships. They both have a similar feel and art style to them, and a creative technique (music vs rakugo) is central to both. If you enjoyed Sakamichi, you'll almost definitely like Shouwa just as much, if not more so.  
It is quite rare to find a show that doesn't just focus on either its story, or its characters, especially one that manages to handle both well. If you fell in love with the way the Sentarou and Kaouru interact, then you will no doubt feel right at home here watching Sukeroku and Yakumo argue life out. The way Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu introduces its viewers to the art of Rakugo, is similar to the way Skamichi no Apollon introduces its viewers to the world of Jazz. The way Sakamichi no Apollon makes you fall in love with its music, Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu will make you fall in love with the Art of Rakugo. The same way Sakamichi no Apollon makes you cry when it wants to, Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu will do, many times. read more 
Both shows deal with 2 completely polar opposite characters developing a special relationship over the art they love. There is also a challenging love triangle in each of the shows that serves as the leading cause for the drama 
Both are anime about finding yourself through a chosen form. Both adapted of a josei manga "
28735,31646,10,"Both series are about people who are passionate and talented in a specific thing (rakugo performance and shogi), and both give a very in-depth look as to the complicated feelings you can have toward something you dedicate your life to. Both have excellent character drama, writing, art, and directing.  
Both are stories  about protagonists pursuing success in the only thing they have to fill the void inside while coping with the isolation and loneliness that comes with it. Hurting people  close to them and trying to fix the mistakes are dealt with in both anime albeit in different ways. And even though Shouwa Genroku takes a mature tone compared to Sangatsu, both of these stories are character studies and are pretty good ones at that. 
> the protagonists were obliged to choose the way that they travel still very young> are part of traditional Japanese art and are improving over time> there are several dramas and suspensions around the protagonists while developing the plot and talking more about their trades 
Both have to do with traditional Japanese arts/games and focus on the emotional impacts those skills have on the people who practice them. 
Both series are incredibly introspective series. The main characters are both melancholic but not to the point of being annoying. In fact, they both work quite well with the tone of the series (dealing with doubts and anxiety that come with pursuing a profession at a young age). Also, the supporting cast can be quite uplifting while also dealing with complex issues of their own. Overall, I'd say Rakugo is a little darker in tone as it deals with subjects such as death. However, 3-gatsu is no lightweight either as it deals with subjects such as child abuse but it definitely carries a lighter tone.  read more 
If you liked how one shows emotions, the other does it is a similar artistic and poetic way. 
 Fantastic and entertaining stories with appealing and deep character development. Drama is the strong key on both animes, showing the life and difficulties of a daily day. Both the main male characters grows in personality over the anime. 
Both are great drama anime, if you like one of these, you'll most likely love the other one.They use traditional Japanese art to tell their stories.  
Great dramas that focus on character development. With both Rei and Yakumo, their main focus in life (shogi and rakugo respectively) are things that bring them pain. To them both, this pain is brought about by losing people close to them. 
Shogi and Rakugo. Even without any prior knowledge of these subjects, both shows manage to remain extremely engaging, focusing on the struggles of very well-written characters while showing their lives and relations with others. "
28735,877,3,"- both series focus on performing arts (music/rakugo)- there's a similar dynamic between main characters (unlikely friends)- lots of realistic drama/relationships - both are aimed at similar demographic (josei) 
Both anime are about unlikely and very strong friendship of two very different people. Both deal with how this friendship interjects protagonists' other relationships and life of professional performer (musician or rakugoka, respective). Finally, both ask fundamentally the same question about this friendship. 
i find both of these shows similar in scope, and mature subject matter. while each have their own stories, i find parallels of fame, relationships, and friendships. nana's driving force is music, and rakugo's being storytelling. so if you dig nana, you might find rakugo enjoyable? or not? but give it a shot. "

Both share an uncommon narrative structure: the season starts and ends in the current timeline, while most of the season is a long flashback happened in an earlier phase of the character's life.Character dynamics are similar: duel MCs that act as foil to each other and at the same time share a common passion/core value.The stories start in the characters' youth and follow them well into their adulthood. The reveal of the past will shed a new light onto the characters' present actions and relationships. The previous timeline ends in tragedies which are partially remedied in the later timeline. The characters have a second chance at making up for past regrets.  read more "
28735,5081,1,"Honestly, there's nothing similar between the two series. But! They both do love the art of storytelling and explore it thoroughly. Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu follows the traditional way as it also unfolds the history of Rakugo while the Monogatari series take narrative into the future. I think that all four-eyes, literary types and bookworms will be happy to have their minds blown away by both of them. "

I have seen people comparing Light Yagami and Lelouch Lamperouge but to me, these two guys aren't similar at all.But on the other hand, the main character of Fate/Zero Kiritsugu Emiya, is really similar to Light. They both are emotionless, dark, have ambitions to create a better world and know that trivial things won't change the world. The only ting that these two characters have different is that Light has a god complex and Kiritsugu doesn't. So, if you like Fate/Zero, I think you would like Death Note as well, especially if you are a Kiritsugu fan. 
Finally a smart show for smart anime watchers "
11741,1,2,"The feelings of both shows are similar since as the story processes, more characters are taken out making it more lonely. For the most part, it reflects on their point of views and their backgrounds. Both have great action, soundtrack, animation, and development. Also similar conclusions as well. I found some character similarities, Kiritsugu=Spike, Kirei=Vicious, Rider=Jet and Kiritsugu's band has the same amount that Spike has. Trust me it's linear since each episodes focuses on the story then they show backstories and pasts, etc. 
F/Z's second half is what you call Bebop's 2nd half in plot and ending.Spike and Kiritsugu continue to fight but at the same time unable to move on from their past.Death counts take toll and moments with realism will destroy idealism to the point that the world is a cruel place in reality.Gen Urobuchi is one reason why the story is great and even helping the 2nd half defines the show to update Bebop to it's modern setting with high caliber animation, soundtrack, and voice acting.One can say that F/Z's popularity in Japan makes it the Japanese version of Bebop due to it's popularity in the West. read more "

36098,23273,36,"Similar character developmentEvokes similar emotions 
-The main dynamic between the two leads is extremely similar-Both generally have a carefree and uplifting tone masked by a twinge of sadness, though Shigatsu has lots of moments that do not necessarily have that same tone-Both aim to revolutionize the audience's view of the world and inspire change 
Main boy & girl are complete opposite of each other.Girl live her life to the fullest meanwhile Boy have struggle with social interaction.Story about dealing with misfortune, grief, and growth.Also great love story, without official relationship status. 
Life...is a drag, and having a stable social one is even a bigger drag. Unlike in Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, in Kimi no Suizou wo Tabetai the main character copes with antisociality & school problems, while in Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso the main character copes with other more complex mental barriers, ""main character copes"" that's a little misleading, MAIN CHARACTER gets pushed over his limit by an extroverted female lead that wishes to help the main character, that's how it should be -- while slowly developing feelings for our troubled male protagonists. Both stories are tragic yet beautiful. 
Both are great stories with similar plot lines.  KimiSui follows much of the same plot at first but there's a much different ending.  Both are dramas with romance elements, although the dynamic is different than in YLIA.  Both have an outgoing female lead and an introverted male protagonist.  Everything good about YLIA follows suit in KimiSui. 
Human relationships in general are very hard to handle and understand. These two animes show the real difficulty behind that, they talk about and how a girl, full of happiness and energy, tries to help and get related with an antisocial boy, who does not care about making friends, having new experiences, we could even say that them do not care about life at all. Is she going to make him change? 
A story of two very similar characters but different in their own regards. 
These tear-jerking animes can broaden your view of life and emphasize the importance of living every moment as if t's your last.The heroines struggle with an incurable disease and shows us how they make the most of their residual time with loved ones surrounding them,captivating us in a touching and mesmerizing journey! 
Same kinda story, sick girl meets antisocial guy and their story. Both extremely sad and heart breaking. 
A lot of similarities in relation to the main characters, and the situations they're put in. Main male has a very negative view on everyday life until he meets the main female lead, who tries to make the best out of her terrible situation. Both shows also share similar scenes towards the end  
Both had similar plot and characters. Stories about an ill popular girl becoming friends with an antisocial boy whilst changing the boy's life. 
In the two anime, you have two boys who was living in their own world until a single petal that drifted into their life. Both tells a tale almost similar, yet different in countless ways. They both tells the story of life, death and importance of person in life but presently in a vastly different but admirable way. If you liked one, then you'll mostly likely like the other too~   
And then here we go. You know what i mean because if you've read another user's recommendations then this one's not much different than the other. Ok so here's my thought, instead of telling how is this similiar to each other i'm gonna tell what's different. Because the difference are much less. So the difference is the setting. Just different place, different event, and maybe different behavior between the MC's. But all the other things are same. Like the same damn character, same circumstances, or even same plot. I'm not gonna say the shigatsu one are better or the otherwise. But what i'm gonna say is even with those differences or similiarity, you won't get the exact same feeling from both anime so watch one after the another are worth if you're like it. read more 
Follows similar character suffering with illness that is about to dieAnd another character whom the first one loves secretlyAlso the second one gets affected by first one's thoughts finally redeemed Death and life are portrayed very well 
In both cases there are similar themes but with certain differences that will make you end up loving them and also end up crying. 
Unfortunately, some of the similarities will have to be omitted to avoid spoilers.- Both portray the reality of a more apathetic protagonist, who changes his perspective on life based on involvement with a girl.- Both contain relationships between a practically opposite couple. Sakura and Kaori are really similar in their personalities.- Both moments of final climax are extremely similar (I will let you find out for yourself).- Both carry emotionally impactful messages that are projected on the protagonist, but that are valid for the viewer. In Shigatsu, this is more Character-Focused, while in Kimi no Suizou wo Tabetai, it is more Theme-Focused. 
both feature a main girl who appears to be on a timer. both explore the relationships between characters and how meaningful connections can change a person for the better.  
-Both shows possess a character suffering from an illness.-The bond between the two protagonists get stronger and stronger as time passes.-Both are bittersweet and beautiful in their own way. 
Both have titles that don't make sense unless you watched it till the very end which will be revealed that increase the impact of the story. The cheerful and optimistic girl and the antisocial boy hanging out with their own story and adventure to be remembered as a flashback at the last scenes to bring tears to your eyes. Both reminds you to live your life to the fullest and the importance of appreciating your own existence.The stories started in spring. Where the sakura blossoms in spring. 
Similar plots, yet a different story to tell. 
Both main male characters have personal, social or mental issuesBoth main male characters have to overcome those issues with the help of the love interestThey both teach people to value life and the people you know because life can end at any moment so you have to cherish these moments before they become memories 
Both have very strong feels and both endings are sad. And also both Heroines are cheerful despite their situations 
+ Both involves one of the main characters dealing with a certain illness+ Both of them involve romance and involve high school+ Great animes to watch if you are looking for a good tearjerker I recommend both Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso and Kimi no Suizou wo Tabetai if you want a great high school romance anime with a great storyline. It will make you laugh and cry and also make you smile.  
Same premise of terminal illness and ensuing relationship development between MC and patient. Your Lie in April hits all the same notes (pun intended) as I Want to Eat Your Pancreas, but better. 
It's almost exactly the same thing. I'd personally argue Shigatsu explores the same subjects more/a little better, but what do you expect, one is a series, one is a movie. One is going to have more time and content than the other. To name some comparisons: Both deal with a nerdy/isolated boy getting attached to a girl with serious health problems. How they deal with that is a major factor in both titles. Hiding these health problems also plays a part in both. 
Both are about a tragic love story. Male protagonist of both anime are aloof and and girl who is the female protagonist changes his life. These shows are really sad cant say much about it or it will get spoiled. 
I watched ""Your lie in April"" before watching this. Every detail from starting to the end felt like the same thing. Both anime are amazing having depressed main characters and a (SPOILER ALERT) dying cheerful girl. I really felt the same way after watching this movie like I felt after watching YLIA.  
If you liked how beautifully Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso deals with relationships and the impact some of us can have on others in a short period of time, then you'll definitely love Kimi no Suizou wo Tabetai just as much. Both of them have similar themes and messages, likeable female main characters and relatable male protagonists. With stunning visuals, inspiring character development and an overall great story, this movie will hopefully exceed your expectations.   
Both MCs are guys who appears to be emotionless or unhappy. They then both meet a girl who is very energetic and cheerful. Both girls also have health problems which they try to deal with. Very similar in terms of animation and art style. ""I want to eat your pancreas"" revolves a lot around books, whilst ""Your lie in April"" is more about music. 
The plots are great, and gets very interesting in the later episodes, the character sketches are also op... personally I really loved both of them 
- Both have that one gorgeous female character that changes the MCs life into the better.- Both give similar vibes with the Drama and Romance genre.- They both have a depressing and sad ending.- Both are Tearjerkers.- Both are really good.If u liked one of them u’ll for sure like the other too. 
Basic Plot Outline is kind of similar but if one likes Kimi no Suizou wo Tabetai, the person will absolutely love Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso. 
The theme, elements, the characters' personality, and how the story flows are similar to YLIA. Although the ""Kimi no Suizou wo Tabetai"" is not a genre of music, but when you watch it, you'll remember and have a thought like ""Oh, I remember YLIA. It looks like this."" I'll recommend you after watching the YLIA, watch this movie. I'm sorry if I'm the one who flooded your house. 
I first watched Shigatsu, so when watching I Want to Eat Your Pancreas, and the story unfolded, i noticed the similarities between them:The two of them have similar characters, you can easily notice this in Kaori and Sakura, cheerful waif- i mean girls, with an illness. Its also noticeable in the MCs and i found Kyouko a little comparable to Tsubaki, same with Issei and Watari.Also, one thing i liked about both is how they have a certain small focus on Spring, April and the blooming of Cherry Blossoms, its quite beautiful. Similiar themes and vibeGreat character development as the story progresses, if you didn't like the MCs that much at first, give them a little time.Considered as tear-jerkers by pretty much everyone (and they didn't lie)The fact is, if you liked Shigatsu and watched it first (like me) or vice versa, you will love the other! So, what are you waiting for? Go on and watch them! They are basically look-alikes! read more 
They both have the same message and the two main character in each anime have very similar personalities and developments. 
Quite Similar story plot with unexpected twist packed with heartwarming moments. This is an amazing tearjerker. "
36098,28851,11,"The female character completely changes the life of the male character in the story. Male characters change throughout the story from the beginning to the end of the movie.Sure, watching this movie will make you cry and change your view of seeing life, because the thread that separates life and death is questioned.Importantly, people can change the lives of others completely, and the animation shows it. 
Both male main characters at the beginning of the film are socially detached from the world until they meet the main female character- both with a health problem. Both films revolve about friend ship and the meaning of living. 
Both are Movies with God Tier art style!Both have MC that doesnt give a darn about societyBoth have almost the same concept but differs in many ways, Main Dude is ignorant about society and then they suddenly met a girl who at first they thought ""Eh, Just another one of these, ill forget about her later."" but then unknowingly made a deep connection to the girl and actually enjoys to be with her. 
If you like crying or a heavy amount of feels then both of these films have that.Both movies have a string message about doing the most you can in life and some of the struggles certain people have to live with.They both are drama anime with hints of romance here and there. Both also have the male lead who doesn't really try to make that many friends and keeps to themselves, and then they both have the female lead who have disabilities or diseases that they need to live through each day.These two films are really amazing and also have pretty visuals and nice soundtracks and are all together great! read more 
Both are very good movie with a very good story. 
A slice of life movie about a friendship that makes you feel and love the characters along the way. 
Feelings, sad side, tear maker, beautiful characters, the story from the perspective of an apparently bad character.If you liked ""Kimi no Suizou wo Tabetai""""i want to eat your pancreas"" so you will love this one more, and it will make you cry from the things written up.enjoy it  
Both Movies Feature a relationship between two people. Both have a wonderful story about how two people grow and learn how to work with each other. Not existing separately but together. 
Both are very depressing but I think best movies of all. Must watch it if you want to learn about life deeply... 
Great Storyline, Animation. Make people cry like hell, so emotional. Nice Message at the End. 
If you want a sad movie to cry to and ya already saw this one you should try this because its sad and a=changes you're perspective on somethins like like this movie does so yeah it also has great animation  "
36098,32281,8,"Both stories are wonderful and very exciting. You can't help but fall in love with the characters. The animations are similar and the story is moving, too. 
Both of these movies are great love stories with plot twists and moments to make you cry. Although the plots are a bit different and the conflicts are different, I believe that if you like one of these movies you'd like the other. Both have very beautiful visuals and the songs/ost are very similar. 
its a more defined version of your name , its not a too typical of a romance movie and its special in its own way . 
- similar vibes- both have good animation and styles of animation are kinda similar- similar feels - both include romance -both have good music! (actually quite similar music at some points)- great plot twists in both! 
similar themes 
I'm kind of surprised that people don't usually relate these two. They both have very similar art styles and soundtrack at first. They also both explore a cute adorable romance with an InTeReStInG twist (although the way they handle things from that point on is very different). Pancreas Movie is a bit more edgy, but not too much. They are very different experiences but have enough similarities that if you enjoyed the masterpiece that is Your Name, you will likely enjoy the almost-masterpiece that is Pancreas Movie. 
A story that is just as beautiful and even more compelling characters. If you watched Kimi no Na wa, and it was something you enjoyed, then Kimi no Suizou wo Tabetai is the perfect movie to follow up. Drama, romance, a beautiful soundtrack, plot twists, it's all here waiting for you. 
Although the animation is far superior in ""Your Name,"" ""I Want to Eat Your Pancreas"" creates an amazing story about two individuals who learn from each other and grow together. The latter has more of a romantic approach, however, ""love"" simply cannot describe the relationship between our two main characters. Both are great and truly worth the watch! (Also the first anime that ever made me cry as I'm not the most emotional person)   "
36098,38329,2,"Rascal Does Not Dream of a Dreaming Girl draws inspiration from the shock scenario of I Want to Eat Your Pancreas. Although Seishun requires a 13 ep season leading up to the movie, the payoff is so much better.  
Plot twist in the middle was very similar to the twist in 'pancreas'. Also some cocepts of story were alike "
36098,4181,2,"In these shows, an initially apathetic main character is taught to cherish his life and those around him by a sickly girl. Through the moving, and at times silly, experiences of the main characters, these stories show that even though happy times may not be permanent, hardship can happen at any time, and those dear to you will die, every moment is worthwhile. 
Both are heartbreaking pieces of art, with an amazing storyline and lots of tears along the way "
36098,37450,2,"Similar character interactions (in relation to the 1st arc of BGS), involving the aloof male lead and the expressive female one. Both cases contain a lot of sharp dialogue  
If you enjoyed Kimi no suizo wo tabetai I strongly recommend Bunny Girl Senpai. Although it's more or less supernatural, this series beautifully portrays the struggle of life during the years of adolescent's. The character design and development is brilliantly done throughout this series, and the ending is sure to make you cry. "
36098,35839,2,"These two shows make me think about what it means to live a meaningful life, to prevent myself from wasting it, and to appreciate the people around me. The characters go through relatable struggles, they strive for what was missing in their life previously (breaking free from fear and uncertainty to go on an adventure, in the case of Mari, and making human connections, in the case of Haruki). These yearnings (whether the characters realize them or not) hit close-to-home for me, and they are some of the most inspiring stories I've seen, so I'd highly recommend both of these shows. 
Both let you reflect on what you're doing in your youth "
36098,10408,1,both have sad and depressing ending 
32983,31646,2,"Warm atmosphere with lots of slice of life moments truly relaxing and very touching.The two main characters have a painful past and are orphans. They also grew up in host families.However, 3-Gatsu No Lion focuses on shogi while Natsume Yuujinchou is rather a fantasy series with supernatural creatures (yokai) 
Plotline and setting are different but I think if you enjoyed Natsume Yuujinchou, then you will enjoy 3gatsu no Lion, too.They have a familiar feeling I cannot explain well...-Main characters have similar background. Rei is an orphan who went through bad experiences and met nice people too.-Both have heartwarming and sad/bittersweet moments.-The narrative gives off a somewhat familiar feeling.-Both are slice-of-life and you can see the struggles of MC in both of them. "

Both series by the same creator ""ONE"" and both adapted from his iconic web comics.Unsurprisingly art style, character designs and sense of humour are almost identical.Both shows have great OST's and animation. 
Both of these stories are written by ONE, and have the same sense of humor. They started out as webcomics, although you'll notice that the style is different, as OPM got picked up by a bigger company, and got a new artist, although the story is still written by ONE.There are several theories that the worlds are actually connected.Mob and Saitama have very similar personalities, that are along the lines of emotionless, although they both have different reasons for such.Both build up their allies, and occasionally, foe turns into friend.  
Both made from the same creator. Both are action packed with fantastic fight scenes. Both contain humor that will make you LOL. If you watched one of these and you enjoyed it I would defo recommend watching the other.  
One Punch Man and Mob Psycho 100 have a really similar feeling, that being said the both share the same creator. They both contain a ridiculously overpowered main character who has two emotions, ""OK"" and ""K.O""! They even share a similar art-style. I really enjoyed them both~! ღ(❤♡❤ღ) Super Powers FTW!!! 
Same creator, same style of comedy, both have similar nice art and a have a very op main character that doesn't seem to care about it. If you like one of these shows, you will most likely like the other. 
Both of these series are really unique on their own but share a similar humor and main character. The biggest difference is probaly the art Style. One Punch Man used the redrawings from another mangaka while in Mob Psycho 100, Bones went all out and used ONE's original drawings. Which gives off a great vibeI can assure you that if you liked either series the other is going to be a fun ride all over again. 
Both are by the same author. Both are good. 
This is literally the same exact show - same type of comedy, very similar art style, even the main character is identical in looks and power.It's One Punch with Ghosts - If you like one, you'll like the other. 
Both original mangas are made by the same Author : ONE.As having the same author, the art style is the same.Those two share a lot in common thanks to their main characters, who are totally overpowered, where Saitama is a physical monster whereas Mob is a psychic monter. 
Same creator same overpowered MC.Thats all you need to know 
When I saw the first episode of this show, there was only one thing going through my mind: One Punch Man. Why? Simple, the main character of Mob Psycho 100, Kageyama, is like a mini Saitama from One Punch Man. Here's some things the two main characters have in common:- They are always bored- They are overpowered- They are both very calm most of the time- Their faces... I'm serious.- They have a sidekick... Completely useless... But they are still sidekicks... Right?The characters are always fighting monsters in an original and funny way, which is something they have also have in common. 
From the same author, One punch man and Mob Psycho 100 both are comedy anime with a similiar art style and way of making jokes. Both are about characters with superpowers. While the story in one punch man is almost non-existent, the story in mob psycho 100 is the opposite.  
Same author, style and humor 
Comes from the same creator - ONE. With similar tropes of Comedy and action elements blended together with an interesting character set, for both shows equally. 
Same creator, different art style but works quite well, similar comedy, really strong main character, has some very crazy twists that you should expect from One but you won't actually expect, and overall is amazing.  
Both series star overpowered MCsBoth series share similar, incredible visual style and animationBoth shows have similar humorBoth shows have a similar paceBoth shows are based off of the creations of one author, ONE, and it really shows 
Made by the same web manga creator ONE. The style is simular (all be it mob psycho being more flashy). however the witty humour and amazing fight scenes are in both anime. 
Same author , main character in both series have similar personality ,in both series characters have super natural abilities    
Similar fashion in terms of character styling, attitude, as well as both have overpowered main character. Similar comedy and joke. No wonder since it is from the same author. A bit different in term of environments art since Mob designed to be a bit more sketchy compared to OPM.  
Made by the same author, both Mob Psycho 100 and One Punch Man share a lot of similarities with each other. The protagonists are very powerful but are lacking in other aspects. Both the shows follow their main characters, as they learn that being all-powerful doesn't solve everything. If you enjoy great fights and good character development in anime, you'll probably enjoy both the shows. 
Yes others said it all, let me tell again. These anime have- similar vibe with similar main protagonists- the main character never brags about his strenth- his strength his limits and source of his strength are not known- finally the art of both is literally the same 
It's the same actor, so that means, same humorous style. The protagonists have almost a equally mindset of what they doing. Both have good animation, therefore it has good dose of action. Interesting support characters. That's it.You'll not regret. 
They are made by the same mangaka, One!Most facial expression in Mob Psycho 100 are based out of Saitama's ""Ok"" face. Both anime contain a similar story starting from the main character  already having a monstrous strength. Action are undoubtedly awesome and characters have various personality even though their face are... Similar.Personally a really amazing anime that are shadowed by the greatness of OPM. A must watch for those who want more of OPM after watching all the OVAs. 
They were both created by the same person and both have a main character that has trouble having emotions and is put in weird scenarios yet One Punch Man is more comedic focused. 
Both feature an unassuming main character, who is overpowered. The side characters can be very dramatic, which plays of the main characters very calm, bored demeanor. The art style is very similar, and so is the humor.  
Similar humor, similar protagonist and idea. 
Well, the biggest similarity is the main character, both have a really similar design, face: a poker face. Both have one of the best animations ever produced. Both have a lot of action, WITH eye-pleasing visuals. The humor is insanely similar. 
Both protagonists are very strong but they pretend to act like common people  
Same author, both main characters have similar personality and both have overwhelming power 
Both are written by ONE, both are comical and very enjoyable.  If you liked OPM, you will most probably like Mob Psycho 100, vice versa 
Same overpowered main characters and very good comedy. 
It looks like a strong character with a straight face, destroying all enemies in its path 
They are both quality action anime but OPM has much more comedy and Mob psycho more storyline action 
-- They are both by the same author-- Both have characters who cant control their powers-- Both also have side characters who try to be as powerful as them 
Saitama and Mob look and behave similarly. They both have a ""sidekick"" character who aren't as powerful (although, Genos can definitely beat up Reigen--and almost anybody-- anytime). They are both very powerful characters from the beginning, exaggeratedly so. Both animes have incredible action--and the animation styles for it--and are mostly funny.I'm not caught up with Mob Psycho just yet, but I'm not the only one who has seen the similarities between these two. 
Mob Psycho 100 and One Punch Man were written by the same man, a web comic artist called ONE. So both of these shows share a similar theme of humor and integrate it into bombastic, over the top action scenes. ONE's talent to emotionally connect the audience to his larger-than-life characters in a smooth, natural way is also used to its fullest in Mob Psycho 100. Each show is gorgeously animated and is backed by an appropriately great OST. 
They are basically the same but with them being the opposite such as saitama has basically endless physical strength when on mob psyscho 100. Mob has pretty much no physical strength but has esper powers. (And not to mention its literally written by the same writer the wrote one punch man) 
Mob Psycho and One punch man both have a protagonist with near god like powers who just want to be acknowledged by their peers.  
- From the same Author- Overpowered Main Character- Reverse Mentor & Apprentice Situation 
same style and humor  
Mob in Mob Psycho 100 and Saitama in One Punch man  not only look almost identical, but they behave, react and talk in almost the same way. 
V similar art style and humour 
They have the same author, and the protagonists are pretty similar - average looking with unbelievably strong powers, who yet are somehow too dense to realize the great potential that they hold.I didn't like both of them, but if you liked either one of them, you're sure to like the other. 
They are made by the same creator and have the same animation style, with Mob Psycho staying truer to the web comic it derived from. Mob is more relatable to me than Saitama. The shows are both amazing. 
The MCs have same characteristics and appearances. They are also overpowered and no one can beat them. 
I don't know why but these two anime's just really connect with each other with the main character  
One Punch Man and Mob Psycho 100 both feature an overpowered main character alongside powerful and interesting friends that take on formidable villains with epic fight scenes 
Mob Psycho 100 is the obvious progression for anyone who was a fan of One Punch Man. Given they are both products of the writer One they carry many of the same tropes, namely the dead-pan, obscenely powerful protagonist. However, I believe that Mob Psycho 100 brings more emotion to the table than OPM. There are emotional moments in OPM, but Mob Psycho 100 really takes it home because where Saitama lacks ambition and is only a hero as a hobby, Mob has ambition, just ludicrously misplaced. In this way Mob seems to me to be a more relatable  and in-depth character than Saitama. The supporting cast of MP1 is also a big step up. I love Genos just as much as anyone else, but he can be a bit... robotic. MP1 basically takes the premise and style of OPM, and improves on it in a way that makes an even more engaging and interesting story.  If you liked One Punch Man, you will love Mob Psycho 100. read more 
Aside from the fact that both stories were created by the same manga artist, ONE, there are lots of similarities that mean if you like one show, you'll probably like the other. Super powerful main character? Check. Ridiculous humor? Check. Well thought out side characters and meaningful relationships? Check and check. They're both wonderful. But, saying all that, they ARE completely separate stories that are amazing on their own, not just copies of the other.  
Both series show strong protagonists who deal with their powers, many fights, with fluid animation and the same style of art. From the same creators! 
Both main characters are overpowered, the original manga is by the same author. Really good fight scenes and comedy. 
Similar styles of humor mixed with intense action scenes 
Both series have the same author, and are finger lickin' gud 
Same sense of humor and same absurd fights you should totally watch it. 
Same refreshing take on the overpowered protagonist trope. Each has their own way of handling it that makes them completely unique in their own respect. 
I understand that this is an obvious one, however, most people overlook Mob psycho. these anime are similar that both MC are overpowered and create some of the best fight scenes ever, the animation is always on point, where they differ is that when one punch man second season aired it lowered in quality immensely whoever mobs second season improved not only in the story but in animation too, Mob also has far greater character development. 
overpowed MCfull comedyaction packedsuperpowersliterally almost everything of Mob Psycho100 reminds me of OPM 
Same author, OverPowered main character and in my opinion pretty similar comedy plus Mob’s is dope  
Both are really strong. Mob for being an esper and Saitama for being a hero. But they have their own unique plots that you will never get tired of. :) 
Created by same author, ONE. Overpowered MCs who can defeat enemies without a sweat. Funny and action-packed anime. 
Both main characters are OP but lack emotions and are underestimated because of their appearance. 
First of all it is the same author that wrote both animes. Second, both MC's have great powers and their personality seem similar. I get the same vibe (humor) from both of these animes when I watch them.  
They have got the same mangaka and have got similarities like:-Both protagonists are so OP-They have got uniqe styles -Mob is like Saitama but he is psychic 
In Mob Psycho there are people called espers who are basically same as heroes in one punch man. Main character from Mob has almost same personality as Saitama and is one of (if not) the most powerfull espers. Very similar animation with amazing fight scenes and coreography.  
-it almost have the same graphics as one punch man-Mob Psycho 100 is popular with its strong esper, while one punch man is popular  with its powerful physical hero  
-Both series written by the same author-One is about an overpowered hero and another is about an overpowered psychic-The fight scenes of both series are epic-Both series have an amazing protagonist were an antagonist has chance of winning against. Both MC's have a unique personality according to the perspective of the seriesIf you like this one you will like the other one also 
Just look at the art style. They're both comedies about people with super powers.. And both of them are great. 
they have the same author so the tone and humor are similar and they both have overpowered main protagonists 
Both series were created by the same author, and they both feature amazingly animated action, and lots of comedic moments.If you like lighthearted shows, with some more serious undertones, you ll certainly enjoy these shows. 
-Written by the same author-Amazingly written op mc-Husbando material -Funny but action packed 
Saitama is overpowered, Mob(MC in MP100) is overpowered. Both are unbeatable in the anime. They're strong as hell and they look the same, but Mob has a hair an Saitama's Bald. 
Both are anime adaptations of manga that were made by the same author.Both have similar styles of storytelling, comedic tone, and vibe. 
Both were originally created by the same guy, so both share the same art style and have a similar style of humor. If you like one, you'll most likely enjoy the other as well. 
The main characters have the exact same facial features and are both extremely powerful. The creatorof One punch man and Mob Pyscho 100 are also the same and  
The heroes are pretty cool and charismatic (although differents) and the enemies (like monsters) are very originals and sometimes creepy O_o . That's the main reasons why I recommend this two animes. 
They both have the same creator, ONE, and each has overpowered main characters and humorous side characters.  
Overpowered, but very relatable main characters that are very fun to watch. The stories are great, coming from the same author, but were they really stand out is in their execution. Both are filled with sakuga and some of the best animation anime has to offer, with a varied staff that really seems to have put passion into each work. 
Similar kind of humor. Both have strong/OP main character with personal issues. 
Produced by the same author both of these aim to explore the mentality of an overpowered character, both have great humour, characters, and animation 
Quite a similar premise and both come with great animation 
Never too serious, always have a good humor that surrounds for every character. Battle scenes, animation, sounds and the story is great. I recommend this anime for those who want to laugh and see some amazing fight scenes. 
Same writer, same general style of humour meeting over-the-top action! Highly recommended! 
Similar type of humor and OP mainThey are both from the same author 
One Punch Man and Mob Psycho 100 were both made by the same person, One, with very similar purposes and ideas. OPM and MP100 are both great but personally I think Mob Psycho is better than OPM. Defiantly should check Mob Psycho out if you like One Punch Man and have not seen Mob.  
The heroes of both shows are insanely powerful and are subject to intense, exciting fight sequences. With overwhelming strength, they must find value in the mundane life and figure out how to grow as people. One Punch Man deals with superpowers akin to comic book heroes/villains while Mob Psycho 100 deals with unique psychic abilities. 
Same creator, OP characters but it has more indepth exploration of morals and such 
Both of them are carrying  about same premise especially an overpowered main character. Also, they have a poker face which makes me laugh all the time. The fighting scene is nice tho. Very recommended 
the two have great jokes, are very excited, have a plot that is even consistent, and that they are from the same creator. 
If you like the over-the-top-comedy with crudely drawn art styles to achieve this level of comedy along with an OP main character and you have already seen one of these. You’ll almost definitely enjoy the other due to the similar vibes they give off. 
  The author of these two animes is the same: ONE.   Even though saitama and mob are so strong, they still look for something that they still lack, like feelings or even a fair fight. 
Both Mob psycho 100 and One punch Man has been made by ONE. Both of this anime is totally similar. ""ONE"" (the creator) learned his mistakes from making OPM (one punch man) and refilled those hole into Mob psycho. So, we can tell Mob psycho is the refined version of One punch man. The MC of OPM and Mob psycho 100 is Over Powered in there world. They are like emotionless. Saitama is too much powerful and he has like infinite strength which made him not only in anime but also the strongest fictional character in history. There were some lackness in OPM. Saitama being emotionless, OP, less credit taking somehow pissed some of us guys.But Mob psycho is totally good. Everyone knows about Mob's power. Mob is freaking powerful but not infinite level strength. He also has romantic feelings.In overall, I prefer mob psycho though both of this anime is good. Try it out! read more 
Both series are made by the same creator with similar nonchalant overpowered main character with an internal day to day struggle based on the usefulness and enjoyment of their own abilities. Both protagonist are lackluster in their own way while they are great and supported by great side characters. Comedic,action,satirical they contain similar traits that will surely entertain you. 
They both have very powerful main characters. They also both have a variety of powers. 
1. Both anime are by the same author.2. Both anime have an overpowered main character.3. Both anime have great funny humor.4. Both anime have clean animation.5. Both anime have loveable side characters. 
They are both made by the same guy and Mob Psycho is better and has better animation while one punch man is good by overrated and overhyped. 
Both anime has overpowered characters, one with strength and one with psychic powers. For anime starters or newbies Mob Psycho and One Punch Man highly recommend because both of them are enjoyable show, entertaining and really great to begin with.  
Both have similar overpowered MC with similar designs and psychological porblems. Second MCs usually get all the praise, even though they are not as powerful as MC. 
It is written by the same creator ONE so if people enjoyed OPM, then they can also enjoy MP100 due to the similar humor. 
i mean it's made by the same dude so it's bound to be similar. but seriously, Mob Psycho is a really great show and I highly recommend it. 
If you liked one of these shows, you will love the other. There are many OPM references in Mob Psycho 100 as well. Both shows are very unique and entertaining to watch. Highly recommend these two shows to any anime fan. 
The main characters have supreme powers but their view of life is simple. 
-a BEAUTIFUL animation-a absurd sense of humour-really great characters and MC 
Both series are originally created by the director One in the Web Manga. Their art style is just phenomenal, you can feel the characters are constantly moving even during the fight scenes. The main characters are almost identical with similar design, similar behavior and they are both very powerful. Also both series are extremely funny and they have interesting twists. 
Both have main protagonists that are extremely overpowered plus some really good action, also have similar if not the same artstyle  
--> Both of the Anime's Have Same Mangaka--> Both Saitama and Kageyama Shigeo are Over-Powered--> Both of these anime's have some similar content in between.--> Both of them have a lot of comedy and humour.  
SIMILARITIES:- OPM and MP100, both were written by the same Mangaka. - Both of them have an overpowered MC.- Both of them have comedy and action. DISIMILARITIES:- MP100 has a school set-up, whereas in OPM, it's a kind of Hero Association set-up. - OPM does not have villains who creates a great impact on the MC. All the villains are easily eliminated by the MC. 
To everyone who loved the action packed and beautifully animated first series of One Punch Man, you should give Mob Psycho 100 a try. Both share the same creator and an overpowered main character, although Mob Psycho goes deeper on the emotional development of the characters in it. I give both a 9/10. 
Same creators. MC's have pretty much the same personality. Similar art style. Both probably just as funny. Both MC's have a lot of power too. 
I'm just gonna say 'One' (pun indeed) thing about my experience with these two:""Don't Judge a book by its cover."" If you like seeing Overpowered protagonists fighting evil in a comical way, you'll definitely love these 2 shows.  
It was made by the same creator and has a similar synopsis with an overpowered character who suffers from mental issues this anime is equally as funny with a great main character and awesome side characters. 
They are by the same creators and according to the manga take place in the same universe so they are supper similar. 
Same author, similar humor, and overpowered main character. 
Made by the same team as OPM, great funny show with interesting characters and deep undertones. And another seriously OP MC, we all love it. 
Same author and brilliant animation 
Both anime are made by the same author.Both anime have the same funny humor.Both anime have breathtaking animation. 
Both involve an OP MC and are both entertaining asf. Mob psycho is a bit deeper than one punch man but one punch man is more entertaining. Two must watch’s. 
They have the same humor, art style, and epic fight scenes.  
Same author, same concept. POWERFUL BUT LONELY MALE PROTAGONIST  
Both of these stories are written by ONE, and have the same sense of humor. They started out as webcomics, although you'll notice that the style is different, as OPM got picked up by a bigger company, and got a new artist, although the story is still written by ONE.There are several theories that the worlds are actually connected.Mob and Saitama have very similar personalities, that are along the lines of emotionless, although they both have different reasons for such.Both build up their allies, and occasionally, foe turns into friend 
Both of these are great anime created by One. They have similar art style, humor and they both follow an OP main character. 
Saitama and Reigen are somewhat alike. They're both adults just tryna live life, but Saitama gets caught up in hero society bullshit meanwhile Reigen gets caught up in spirits and such. "
30276,918,15,"Where will you go if all your dreams have been fulfilled? That is the question that both series deal with. They don't have a serious plot, just the daily life of a man who is trying to live his life. There are battles and funny moments sometimes. Recommend to people who are looking for some funny anime to watch to add some spice to their life. 
Although not exactly the same, the main characters of both stories share personality traits. Gintoki and Saitama are not overly concerned over their public image and are willing to blemish their reputations to accomplish a goal. They both also display nonchalance in extreme situations and are also the strongest fighters in their respective universes. Unlike Saitama though, Gintoki has displayed cowardice and laziness in certain situations and will avoid trouble if possible. The settings in each anime are also similar in that they contain futuristic and fantastic elements, such as the presence of aliens and the usage of advanced technologies. Each anime also approaches comedy from a similar angle. Both Gintama and One Punch Man employ satire but through different means. One Punch Man employs satire through character designs whereas Gintama uses referential dialogues and cameo appearances. read more 
The mix between the Comedy and the action If you liked gintama you're probably gonna have fun watching One punch man too  
To begin, both series are super hilarous and share the same kind of humor. Also the two series contains ""serious arc"" wich is freaking awesome! They even have the same kind of main character (Laziness Overload). They are very common in a good way ;) The only difference is in the universe. OPM is the super hero universe while Gintama is the Edo universe.So if you love Gintama, there is no reason to hate One Punch Man! (and vice versa) 
Gintoki and Saitama have a common ideal,  They fight for their own reasons and not to appease others. They are too lazy... Gintoki is lazy by birth whereas Saitama gets lazy as he lacks a serious opponent time after time. They are funny and when they get serious they'll bring devastation upon their enemies. While Gintoki (Shiroyasha)  is a lazy samurai living by his own rules, Saitama is just a guy that serves as a hero for a hobby. 
(Oo I actually wanted to be first to this one; I tried a while back...)But wow, this really is all about comedy, world building, and reasonable characters. The fact of the matter is we have two MC who are heroes down to their very souls but don't acknowledge it with their exterior mannerisms. The irony behind their characters and the world around them are similar and wonderfully uncanny than what we usually see.Gintama is very much amidst the top of the anime industry, and OPM will soon join it. 
While their storylines are rather different, they both offer a humourous take on the shounen genre. Both main characters are hilarious and interesting. There are unique and alien-like villians (and just... characters in general) in each and both feature shounen-like battles (opm more than gintama). If you liked the humour in one of them, you'll probably like the other! 
Do you want a deconstruction of typical shonen clichés? Do you want a OP main character who just don't care about his enemies' complaints or objectives? Do you want to laugh in every scene? These series are for you! 
By far later episodes of One Punch Man really gave me a strong Gintama vibe. Why?* They both are about the misadventures of it's heroes (Gintama with a samurai, OPM with a tokusatsu hero)* REALLY similar parodic humor, including high levels of randomness.* In plot, both would start out without a particular story arc whatsoever until this kind of stuff would later come, while Gintama tries to be more episodic with it's own arcs.* Both also have good fight scenes.There are some dissimilarities, like OPM having less females and a highly overpowered MC, and Gintama touching a lot of references to other series and being more longer.They will not dissapoint in the anime comedy zone and will get you hooked for more. And also, be sure to check out the OPM manga if you want more of it. read more 
Parody genre - ☑MC who are funny & badass when they need to be - ☑ 
-Great gag humor, Gintama has more parody oriented though.-both are comedy shows with action as supporting genre 
Both of these animes are hugely funny comedies with fantasy aspects. I love both of them equally and they both have the same hero. I highly recommend both of them! :) 
Yep that's right Gintama and one punch man are somewhat similar to each other Both of them are { EPIC } comedy  and fighting shows Mind the brackets Epic means Epic both have characters funny and strong but in one punch man i should say super super strong and if you are thinking about comedy then think not all you have to see them especially the face of one punch man character and now about gintama it has broken 4th wall within 4th wall i mean literally it has. Thats why it is also  rated the highest anime above all anime and all the characters will make you laugh (laughing my ass off). Thats all now you have to just see them both. One last thing they are both parody shows of all other shows especially Gintama read more 
They both are very comedic on the ways a ‘hero’ is presented. They are also both very humourus and like to poke fun at the modern superhero stereotype. They are also both parodies. Which again reinforces there similarities. 
Both protagonists are always up to make money, and they both teach you why defending others is a responsibility for the powerful "
30276,11061,10,"One punch man has HERO ASSOCIATION, while hunter x hunter has HUNTER ASSOCIATIONBoth of them tells about character's unique power. 
Both animes are from the same studio. Meaning they look awesome, just AWESOME.The fights are easy to follow, look amazing and have a lot of detail.Some characters looks really remind you of another in a positive way.Both animes have a goal to aspire. Becoming a great Hunter or a great Hero.They involve different species and a complex varied world. 
Many of the characters from One Punch Man and the setting reminded me of Hunter x Hunter. If One Punch Man weren't a parody, had a lot more episodes, and if Saitama weren't OP, you would almost have a Hunter x Hunter twin-series. 
Both anime are done by Madhouse and have the same overall feel to the series - unique characters, epic battles and power-ups, etc. The ""Hero"" system in OPM and the ""Hunter"" system in HxH are very similar as well. Both are incredibly good shounen series, and while OPM is more humorous, there's a high chance you'll enjoy one if you enjoyed the other.  
Both have some of the same themes like an association of professionals (heroes/treasure hunters) with class ranks and an elite set of very strong people and the main character eventually decides to work his way up the ranks and become more well known and stronger in the process 
Both shows have an organization that the main protagonist joins to fulfill some sort of goal. The Hero Association and the Hunter Association in the two shows remind me of the other. Both have a ranking system which dictates what level of jobs you are likely to be allowed to complete. They involve a rigorous test which has a small passing rate. Also both organizations send out their heroes/hunters to battle and take care of weird creatures that could pose a threat to humanity.  Another comparison is that that main characters have a similar altruistic attitude towards helping people. All in all, these are both great shows that I would highly recommend, so if you liked one, you'll enjoy the other.  read more 
Both have equally crazy fights and whacky characters. OPM opening also parodies HxH's main character, Gon (the punch where he holds his left hand over his right before punching).Both have probably the most brilliant soundtracks ever also. You really need to experience these two. And of course, both are by Madhouse Studio. 
Both are fun and interesting takes on less conventional superheroes, though in Hunter x Hunter they're called Hunters rather than superheroes. Both have a diverse and spectacular cast of minor characters. Hunter x Hunter is more emotional, but both have great comedy and are a joy to watch. Both have a lovable main character and a lovable side-kick. 
Most of the characters share a few traits: they seem like normal human beings, but they bear very special talents that might not be recognized in the real world. If you love laughs, drama and the struggles of being “different"", then you will love this as well.

If you love One Punch Man I'm sure a lot of the reason was the hype you felt every time you watched the intro, every time you heard the OST, and every time a fight scene came up. I don't blame you for feeling that hype, One Punch Man is a fantastic show. I consider it to be the second best anime to come out of 2015; second only to Shokugeki no Souma or Food Wars. If you have not watched this show, fix that. Shokugeki no Souma is half-way between being a parody of a Shounen, and actually being a Shounen. It's a Shounen about food. And trust me, this is the most hyped you will ever get about food, Gordon Ramnsay's everything doesn't even compare. The OST is and the animation in the fight(cooking) scenes is just as amazing as OPM's, with the animation in general being better(if we are including the slice of life parts). I believe the story to be even better than OPM's, as well as the overall hype of the show(I will admit, Shokugeki may have the unfair advantage as it's 24 episodes long). I can honestly tell you that Shokugeki no Souma has the potential to be the best anime you watch for a long time, since I have yet to see a better one. I admit I put Steins;Gate and Cowboy Bebop at about the same level, but I don't consider them to be better or worse per se. I believe Shokugeki no Souma to be one of the best anime to ever grace this world despite its laughable concept and joking nature, and I believe that if you were to watch it there is a good chance you will feel the exact same way.Now, if you've watched Shokugeki no Souma and haven't seen One Punch Man, where've you been? Even though I don't consider it to be quite on Shokugeki's level, it's still a top tier anime. Easily in the top 10 of 2015 almost regardless of who you ask. I personally consider it to be the second best of 2015, and if you are looking for some more of that hyped feeling after finishing Shokugeki, this is the perfect anime for you. The OST is just as good Shokugeki's and the animation in the fight scenes is just as good as the animation in Shokugeki's cooking scenes. One Punch Man also does not take place in a high school, so you could have a small break from that. Fantastic anime, almost perfect parody of a shounen, and completely worth the re-re-watch.  read more "

35839,34599,9,"While these two anime are about two totally different things, they are also fundamentally very similar. They are both what I would call a true ""adventure"" anime. Where the anime is about setting off on a journey to go somewhere important to them, they are both excellent and highly regarded anime. 
-both is about exploring the unknown. -Made in Abyss is an exploration within an unknown world in the center of the earth with many strange creatures and side effects on the human body as the depth increases as Sora Yori is about an exploration in the coldest place on the Planet and how the journey is made to  Antarctica (very interesting) 
Our protagonist is a young girl who is desperate and determined to go dangerous journey into harsh environment in order to find her missing mother. 
Both Made In Abyss and A Place Further Than the Universe feature young, middle to high school age children and their love for the great beyond. Shirase and Riko are both traveling to harsh lands to find their mothers and make friends and allies along the way. Made In Abyss has a dark tone, violence and some truly heart wrenching moments while A Place Further Than the Universe is lighthearted, more like a Slice of Life show like K-ON. However, if you are captivated by unfamiliar, harsh landscapes and exploring the unknown then you will love both of these shows. 
Typically follows the same format with kids embarking on an adventure to a difficult place with the goal of reuniting with one of the protagonist's love one. The protagonists in both shows experienced being underestimated and challenged before they are able to set out on their journey.Both shows exude a theme of overcoming odds and never giving up on one's dream thus delivering a feeling of inspiration and freedom. If you were captivated by the atmosphere and curiosity of exploring the vast unknown by one of these shows, then chances are you'd probably like the other. Be wary though, that Made in Abyss is darker and heavy whereas Sora Yori is lighthearted. read more

Made in Abyss and A Place Further Than the Universe both follow the story of a young girl leaving home to find her mother, whom she believes to be missing, but whom everyone else believes is dead. Both journeys have the odds stacked against them, but where APFTTU focuses more on character relationships and the intimacy between friends, Made in Abyss focuses on exploration and discovering one's unknown past.

Otherwise, watch both series for the reasons stated by others for natsume Yuujichou. 
(Zoku) Natsume Yuujincho and Mushishi both share that gentle pacing, along with being for the most part episodic (in a positive way), and a similar main character (though Ginko would be a 10 years older and more mature Natsume, if that's even possible).

No other film stands in the way of non-linear storytelling other than these two—the fifth Kara no Kyoukai film, the grandest peak of the film series deals with themes of the distortion of reality and dreams, much like the premise of Perfect Blue, as key characters become entwined with the audience's view in a convoluted timeline of events. "

Then, it proceeds to jump around like a rabbit on crack, and it left me pondering at the end whether I'd seen one of the best movies of all time or a movie executed in such a way that its flaws were well-hidden.

Supernatural, magic and gore and both have a rather confusing storytelling. In both anime, the story is presented like a puzzle and you have an opening sequence where you see what is going to happen.  
Both masterfully employ non-linear narrative as a mystery/unexplained occurrence is slowly revealed as disjointed ""puzzle pieces"" fall into place throughout their stories. Dark atmospheres and palettes are typically used in both, though Baccano frequently provides comic relief whereas KnK seldom does. Nonetheless, fans of action will find plenty to like in both KnK 5 and Baccano, with both featuring top-notch, smoothly animated fights and occasionally over-the-top gore.  
When it comes down to the story telling, I noticed that it's similar to Baccano!'s style. The movie changes a lot between past and present, though the main difference between these two anime is that while watching Baccano!, you are still able to follow the story and get a clear picture of everything at the end. In Kara no Kyoukai 5, on the other hand, you will get utterly confused at some points of the movie, just wanting to shout out WTF!? "

Both series are in a similar universe (including the presence of the Association of the Magi, the presence of a school for the Magi in England)Both sets are interested in a way to attain the spiral of Origin, a recurring theme in the stories written by Kinoko Nasu.The difference is that Araya Souren (in Kara no Kyoukai) as a magus is interested in the origin while Gilgamesh (in Fate) uses the Holy Grail (another way to reach this spiral of Origin) as a means to bring ""all the evil in the world"" to use its destructive power.I can more detail, it is necessary to view the entire Fate Stay Night and Kara no Kyoukai to understand. Both are adaptations made by ufotable read more

30654,245,3,"Education, Slice of Life, Betrayal, Drama - these genres fit the full package in getting you hyped-up to watch this Anime non-stop! The main protagonist, Eikichi Onizuka, personalities are quite similar to the protagonist, Koro-Sensei, from Ansatsu Kyoushitsu anime; Despite the setting of the story, they are both comical from just their facial expressions alone to the insane actions they performed. They both share similar goals as to help students, striving them to walk the right path in life and giving the audience a sense of thoughts on their real life. Both teacher encounters disadvantage and challenging situation all for the sake of their students despite the consequences whether it's from an illogical or a logical standpoint.If you have the same feeling where you would want Koro-Sensei as a teacher in real life then this anime is the perfect anime for you to watch. This Anime will leave you a nostalgic moments for the rest of your life! read more 
While Ansatsu is more focused on the various students of class 3-E denpa kyoushi is more focused on Onizuka the god like pervy teacher.The former cashes on the various neat tricks and comedy involving the  daily intercourse of the teacher and the class the latter exploits the daily gimmicks of onizuka who has a devil may care attitude about everything.As a whole GTO is a more entertaining watch than Ansatsu kyoushitsu. 
Both anime have a great teacher,though Ansatsu Kyoushitsu is somewhat supernatural compared to GTO they both show the relation of student with their teacher. "
30654,33486,2,"-Both have special school, special students, and special/unique class (Class A in Boku no Hero Academia/Class E in Ansatsu Kyoushitsu).-Class A & Class E are more experienced than the other classes 'cause they have to face the real villains.-Strong figure as a teacher (All Might & Koro-sensei).-Both MCs are very alike that they want to follow their teacher's path.-Other characters are look alike too, like Bakugo & Karma (both are geniuses & violent), Uraraka & Kayano (cheerful & hardworking), Todoroki & Asano (their relationship with their father is kind of similar), etc..-Competitions between the students that give the similar feeling. 
Both r great shows and I feel the same settings when I was watching both shows. both protagonists start off weak but after that, they both got amazing hidden powers. Love both shows equally :D  "
30654,9989,1,Both anime makes people realize the importance of a certain someone . 
40748,38000,20,"Both recent phenomenon series with very similar premises and appeal. Both involve elite human warriors trained to face supernatural beings average humans are powerless against  (demons & curses).  
-They both deal with the supernatural-They are both action packed and more violent and disturbing than your typical Shonen Jump anime-They both have fun sets of characters-The characters constantly have to fight against dangerous and evil supernatural creatures  
Jujutsu Kaisen is basically Kimetsu no Yaiba, but better. They both focus on a young man who reluctantly joins a group that fights supernatural beings (demons for KnY, curses for JJK), but:- Jujutsu Kaisen has a stronger main cast (writing and personality wise)- Jujutsu Kaisen has a more unique and fleshed out power system with more creative uses- Kimetsu no Yaiba REALLY drags in the first few arcs before it starts getting good. Jujutsu Kaisen is good from the beginning.- Jujutsu Kaisen doesn't have Zenitsu in it (instantly better) 
- They both are fighting demons- They both include the genre of shonen- Badass chracters that are selfless and really strong from the start 
Both the anime have the same theme, killing demon/curses. A protagonist who can fight, a badass who looks out for him and a major objective. This just reminded me of Demon slayer so much.  
Some similar aspects include the genre of shonen , fighting off monsters/curse, and the main character is selfless and starts their journey with high potential in strength. 
- both protagonists were forced into this 'new world' due to a tragic event- both protagonists have that 'be good for the sake of it' vibe- wise playful mentor figure (who ultimately seems like a second father of some sort)- antagonists considered to be otherworldly beings- family ties into their motivation for 'being the best'chances are that if you like one of them, you'll probably like the other 
Both anime's are fighting demons and monster in order to keep peace in japan. 
Jujutsu Kaisen is Demon Slayer but good 
Both protagonists are thrown in a similar situation, dragged into the world of fighting and eventually the protagonists join an organization to fight against the evil of humanity. Both have high quality animation and great music, they also try to add a bit of comedy!  
Great art style / animation and badass characters fighting monsters 
- Both are about fighting demons- Both have good animation- Give off similar vibes- Both are hyped or have the potential to be hyped up 
Both are really popular shows that are easy to get into and that successfully integrate a lot of Japanese culture. Both have amazing animation and are beautiful to watch. 
Jujutsu Kaisen (jjk) is actually better than Demon Slayer, including mature scences and great animation of jjk is actually worth it,Give it a watch, Already watched? So like me 
Both have very interesting first episodes. There are cool loveable side characters but what makes them different is that there is a major villian in KnY whilst JK probably will have minor ones as far as I know. 
both have great animation and a not too complex story 
they both fighting demons and having a funny moment on some scene the differences is demon slayer comedy always after fight and jujutsu comedy are before to mid fight other similarity:-both have very good opening and ending-same vibe 
Jujutsu Kaisen is pretty much a underrated Demon Slayer/Kimetsu no Yaiba. If you like animes about demons or like fights, give Jujutsu Kaisen a shot. 
both involve fighting creatures like demons and curses. they also don't have character development because they just rush recklessly into a fight for the rights of others. their mc would do anything to protect others and their loved ones. overall i love both animes. definitely recommended :] 
action, monster/demons, amazing soundtrack, if u love on u most love the other "
40748,11061,7,"Both feature unique power systems and amazing world building. Both series can have a dark gritty tone but perfectly balance it with it's more lighthearted bits. 
they are both shounen and more importanly their power systems are very complex and well though out and fun to see and the two main chracters have very similar personalities beside the hype and pump of Adrenaline you get from the fights and very well done and solidly written villains. definitely recommend jujutsu kaisen If you liked hunterXhunter 
Both have similar power/magic systems, that are structured in very similar ways.Both are dark battle fantasy anime.Both have strong horror elements.Both have memorable casts of memorable characters.  
The two of them have powerful and intelligent fights, and they present great story and characters, you must read the manga and watch the anime 
Has a unique power system. 
If you like the powers and abilities unique to each character similar to Hunter x Hunter or Psyren, coupled with the strong bonds of friendship that's not cliche as naruto and one piece but kind of like how Hitman Reborn was, then this is the anime and the manga for you. Jujutsu Kaisen is malleable enough to be Shonen but has the gore and realism elements in it to also be close to some Seinen anime/manga such as Berserk (well maybe not that fucked up but you know what I mean) or Ajin. Since I have bias towards anime with unique power structures like Hunter x Hunter and Psyren where its just not the generic shout=power up or friendship-danger=instapower, the anime and the manga really speak out to me and I hope you'll pick it up and support it so that the awesome sequences in the manga will continue to be animated.  read more 
First of all, both anime are great. Both anime uses the ""magic power"" system aspect in their shows. (you know what I mean if you watch one of them). Honestly both great shounen, go watch them now. "

1. Master - Student pair in both ANIME. 2. Masters (Sensei) are very cool & funny character in both Anime. 3. Overpowered Protagonist. 4. Art & Animation are excellent. 5. Supernatural Anime with plenty of action.  
Jujutsu Kaisen is essentially mob if it were more serious and less goofy. 
Both are series based on spirits in which both protagonists have great power inside that they cannot control. Both protagonists are also students who are enrolled in a mysticism and athletics club. "
40748,22535,3,"The comparison is clear to anyone who has seen both. Someone even mistook me for watching a new Parasite anime when they briefly glanced over my watching JJK.They both have a foreign entity who inhabits their body and manifests themselves on that body in similar ways. 
Both involve something trying to take over a host's body; and the main character in both are unable to be taken over completely.  
Both are supernaturalBoth are really great Both have the same character designer "
801,13601,3,"Both are from Production I.G and have the similar futuristic police thriller theme to it. In Psycho-Pass the police's special team that are comprised of Enforcers who are latent criminals who are specialized to hunt down other latent criminals. In Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex: 2nd Gig this special unit works for the organization called Public Security Section 9; a division that exist under the Ministry of Home Affairs. The unit is a group who specializes in fighting technology-related crimes like cyberterrorism. Both have a cyberpunk setting. 
Both revolve around a police department in a cyberpunk world, and deal heavily with political themes.  
Both from future, deep, tackles problems in society. I like 2nd GIG more than the 1st GIG "
3297,4181,6,"although in the exterior they look very different,Aria and Clannad are quite simmilar Both of them give the viewer that heartwarming feeling after watching an episode.Also both of them teach the viewer morals through the storyline.Aria is anyway much more less dramatic,because while Clannad can be very tense at times,Aria is always laid back and relaxing...anyway,these 2 animes are both a must watch,especially for the comedy/slice of life fans out there 
Beautiful stories evoking emotional response 
Both shows have the same feel to it. Watch the prequels first. 
Slice of life with a tremendous emotional plots and a lot moral lessons. Clannad After Story is more focused in romance, Aria is focused in the daily lifes of the main characters, both anime series tell the happy and sad experiences of the main characters.  
The core of both series centers around their characters growing and becoming better people, experiencing a new understanding of themselves that become obvious in retrospect.The stakes of both are simple and down-to-earth (humanity is never at stake).  The drama in both series is often understated (especially in Aria).  They both aim to convey something beautiful about life, and if they succeed for you, you might change certain ways how you act or think.They convey in deceptively straightforward but profound terms the beauty and meaning in family or of teaching. 
Both series are affected very important things that make us think about real life.A masterpiece is on the same level with Clannad: After Story. "
3297,4081,2,"They are both slice of life series with some fantasy aspect. Natsume yuujinchou is a bit more serious, but both have many heartwarming moments that really makes you happy for the characters. 
(This recommendation includes all seasons of Aria (3) and all series of Natsume Yuujinchou (6) which similarly have different series names for each season.) Both Natsume and Aria are beautiful location and character driven anime. Both series have amazing character development over the episodic episodes that feels very real. Natsume has a bit more of this, but both series have a huge focus on spirits/ghosts/magic, and how this makes the setting come to life. Most of all, both series will leave you feeling gratitude to the world. "
20583,37965,23,"There is a high chance that if you liked Haikyuu you will like Kaze ga Tsuyoku as well. I'm already loving them both! You can feel the similar vibes coming through. The art styles are very similar so characters like Kageyama from Haikyuu and the main character Kakeru from Kaze look very similar. Also there is something going on with the importance of being ""number 10"".So definitely check out one if you have seen the other since they are both Sports genre and by the same studio! 
Both are about sports and friendship ,a little bit of comedy . They have different stories behind the main characters and most of the character have high-spirited about sports. And when they face the challenges too. HAIKYUU is more about doesn't give up and keep working on it. A lot of emotional parts too...you will love it by having goosebumps . After watching this, you might have the feeling of wanted to play or try the sport (if you know me ;) 
Another great sports anime, that focus more on the characters but have the same feeling as haikyuu also really similar art/animation to haikyuu 
Same music artist, which gives the shows the same vibe musically. Overall similar feel, though. Just an uplifting fun venture from beginners to more experienced in their field. It just has the same vibe as Haikyuu. 
Same art style and characters have some similarities as they're from the same studio. However, the difference in the focus in the type of character. Kaze has a Kageyama figure and Sawamura (Daichi) -like captain figure who are the main focus. There is a similar drive by characters to be in the top. Characters get their backstories, development, comic relief. There are rival schools, flaws and growth. Best of all Kaze is a college anime (FINALLY!) and draws on the incredible experience of competition on that higher level. So definitely check out one if you have seen the other!  
Both animes are created by the same studio and have a similar art style and its 'realisticness'. The teams don't necessarily win, but they grow and become a better version of themselves, especially in terms of camaraderie and teamwork. Of course, Run with the Wind is set in university and members have more personal problems like finances and family, most members being amateurs, unlike Haikyuu where the focus is more on volleyball and competition since the members are already passionate. Both are very inspiring. 
If you like either 'Haikyuu!!' or 'Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru', I can almost guarantee you'll enjoy the other. Both are sports anime which have a good balance between the actual sport and character building, as well as humour and angst. Furthermore, both anime have very similar styles of animation if you like either of their aesthetics.The more you watch of either series, the more attached you'll grow to the characters, which have a wide variety of personalities, some of which you'll find similar between the two anime (e.g. Kageyama and Kakeru). In both anime there is a mix of naturally gifted/genius/seasoned characters and others who are rookies, all of whom grow as a team to try and achieve their goal, which others believe to be unrealistic for the teams.Basically, if you want a series which will make you laugh and cry with a team as they struggle to achieve their goal whilst forging friendships and rivalries, I highly recommend both series. It doesn't matter if you're not too interested in either volleyball or running, both these anime will get you worked up and you'll find yourself crossing fingers during the matches/races. read more 
The main characters of both shows are very similar. Both shows are about surpassing one's limits and while Haikyuu!! focuses more on the volleyball itself, Run With The Wind focuses on a lot more of the characters. Both deal with learning to fall in love with the sport. 
Both sports anime. Similar animation style as are by same production company. Similar main characters however, two different perspectives on sport. Both inspirational, dramatic at times, good music and feel good shows. 
Plot* They're both sports animes with a team of multiple main characters, all being boys* Both series use comedy and slice of life to reduce the intensity Music* (the god) Yuuki Hayashi is composing the OST for both series, meaning the music is really similar (and awesome)Art* The series is both made by Production I.G.* Takahiro Chiba is the Chief Animator Director in both animes. Which means they have the same artstyle 
They're two spokon anime, Haikyuu in indeed about volleyball, while Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru is about running. In each one of them the real protagonist is the team and every single member has his own importance in that; they work so hard to gain what they want and eventually they manage to strengthen their bonds.We have some comedy and funny scenes, but the main focus is on matches (Haikyuu) and races (Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru). 
Ride With The Wind was sadly pretty underrated by the anime community. For years, sports anime have been filled with casts who are high school students or younger. Run With The Wind has a cast comprised of people in college. So then why should you watch this anime if you've watched Haikyuu? Other than the obvious factors as being animated by the same studio, Production I.G and having the same composer, Yuki Hayashi. The 2 are similar in that they are both well-crafted and well-animated shows with decent plot. Seriously, just watch it. 
If you like sport shounen like haikyuu, you will also like kaze ga tsuyoku Fuiteiru. Even the art style is similar. Also Kakeru is like the same character as kageyama.  
If you've ever wondered what would be Haikyuu!! like if narrated from Kageyama's perspective (as it was originally planned by the creators!), Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru might give you a fairly good idea.If you're drawn by Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru's characters' developing friendships and personalities, you'll appreciate it in Haikyuu!! as well, and perhaps even more, since Haikyuu!! is about a team sport, which naturally requires lots of interaction between the players. 
Both anime feature protagonists which are similar in character and their passion of their sport, where Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru brings out more personal drama and focuses more on the connections between the members of the track club. 
-Both have similar style of art-The main characters are really funny-The mc's relationship is rocky at first but later develops into them becoming really good friends-Both the main characters are aiming for a large tournamentI strongly urge you to watch it if you liked Haikyuu!! because I loved kaze ga tsuyoku fuiteiru :) 
Another sports anime from the same studio, Production IG. Very character driven with a case of loveable and unique characters, with a similar underdog theme. I can't recommend this anime enough. 
Lets see, this is basically Haikyu but with running. Yuki Hayashi the composer for the killer OST for Haikyu also composed the music here. Both stories focus on a team that basically starts from nothing, oh and the main character looks a lot like someone from Haikyu. Overall to me it had the same vibe, and at some parts they used the EXACT SAME music. If you liked Haikyu you will definitely like run with the wind and vice versa, it is a overall inspiring sports anime. Oh and I guess it helps that the show references Haikyu to. 
Both are very character driven shows that have a wide range of very real and like-able characters that all band together to reach a goal in a given sport. Out of all the sports animes I have watched, Run with the Wind has the most similar vibe to Haikyuu. Run with the Wind is funny, angsty and inspiring, just like Haikyuu is. If you watched all of Haikyuu already, consider giving this anime a chance! I promise you'll enjoy it. Bonus: Kakeru, the main character and Kageyama have very similar character design and both have excellent character development 
This anime is made by the same studio as haikyuu is, its about running. The characters are funny and lovable, and the story is great! Watch out for a direct reference to Haikyuu in later episodes! I highly recommend this for those of you who are haikyuu superfans like me, you wont be disappointed!  
it's a sports anime, but if you like the character development in Haikuu, you'll love this. It focuses more on the character development than the running, but it's also a pretty good representation of running. 
They are both sports anime where the characters bond and grow closer to each other. Also, the plots are well thought out 
I don't do much sport, but you can sort of see the similarities, where they are both teams starting from the bottom and make there way to the top, assuming you've watched the other seasons of 'Haikyuu!!' as well, you can also kind of compare there desire to not give up. "
20583,170,7,"Protagonist-Raw talented individual whose ability is jumping and almost infinite stamina. Both protagonist are very lively and emotional individuals. Rival- Extremely talented individual who at first believe they can single-handedly win the game. Both anime shows how these individuals grow into a better sportsmen. 
first anime that pop in my head when watching slam dunk is this one 
""Slam Dunk"" and ""Haikyuu!!"" have overall the same plot and characters. They don't focus only on the sport but also have a lot of comedy and drama.Basically they're about a first-year high school student that enters a sports club having natal ability but no experience and has to get along with a very talented, egocentric ""rival"" in the same team who thinks that he can win just by himself. The personalities and roles of the other characters are extremely alike as well, if not exactly the same.Both tell the story of a somewhat now weakened team that aims to glory with the new first-year members, who play an important place in it. read more 
When I started watching Haikyuu I got instant flashbacks of Slam Dunk, because they hold extremely important and clear similarities.Both stories handle a red-headed energetic boy who isn't very good at sports but is eager to improve (despite being for very different reasons at first).Both protagonists have to work with another first-year who they don't get along with very well (and are considered as rivals) but in the end they manage to click and work together efficiently.Both stories hold similar team dynamics: a weakened team that becomes unstoppable thanks to the new first years additions (Karasuno - Shohoku), same region rival team with a prodigy player (AobaJousai with Oikawa - Ryonan with Sendoh) ... and it goes on.Also worth mentioning how realistically both sports are depicted and played, and even allowing the viewer to learn about them as the episodes progress. All of this alongside wonderful character developments and backstories, the emotional struggles of wins and losses, and filled with great light-hearted comedy. read more 
both sports, very dynamic, without forced protagonism, haikyuu learned a lot with slam dunk and did better because hakyuu has better production ambos esportes ,muito dinamicos,sem protagonismo forçado,haikyuu aprendeu muito com slam dunk e fez melhor ,pois hakyuu tem produçao melhor

Both of these anime are in the sport genre and they have this encouraging feeling that makes you want to play sports after watching how they plan and enjoy their game. "
20583,263,6,"Both are ""real sport"" anime (no powers etc), both have really funny characters and good openings, both make you want to play sports, in both you'll see the main character enjoy their respective sport and grow up with it. The main difference is that in Ippo you'll see professional sport, while Haikyuu!! shows amateur sport. 
Sports? No, majority of people didn't start these for ""sports"", just BECAUSE it's supposed to be 'good', and guess what? It was unexpectedly GOOD. Volleyball & boxing, the difference is so humongous that it's simply silly, yet when watching either of these you get the same vibes, feelings... These two interpret 'training' so well that it's enjoyable, the training buildup is so great, that long training, and finally the opponent that gets a piece of that TRAINING! What a bad phrasing... But, you get me! Hopefully? Both surprise you, both are beyond your expectations... 
Hajime no Ippo and Haikyuu!! explores the theoretical part of their respective sports very well, being able to make you like them. The comedy is quite present in both, and this is due a lot to its extremely charismatic characters. 
These are two of the best sports anime 
In both the anime the main character is a shounen protagonist whose works hard to create a name for himself. even though the story and the plot are different Hajime No Ippo is a fantastic sports anime to watch.  
If you are a new anime fan and only watched Haikyuu as your sports anime then I think you will also like Hajime no Ippo as both are very good sports anime. "
20583,28171,5,"Both of these stories follow a very energetic main character striving to become better at what they do (volleyball and cooking). These MC's never give up no matter the cost. There are a large variety of different characters in each anime that help the mc. And, of course, there are rivals as well. The music and intensity of the matches (volleyball matches, shokugeki matches) are very similar, but Shokugeki no Souma has more comedy to it. All in all, these just look and feel very similar. 
Though the theme of these 2 anime is very different, they both apply the same kind of formula. A lot of epic moments, suspense, comedy... In the end, there's not that much of a difference besides the actual theme. 
both of the series are comedies, there is competition and nerves but also a lot of funny scenes and jokes (rather good or bad) in both anime.you can have a laugh but also feel the pressure of the moment, eg a competition or, in Haikyuu, a match. both are kind of loose and relaxing to watch  
Even though both anime may have a different concept, they are actually pretty similar. Both anime are labelled as comedy and shounen. They both have interesting characters that you can connect to, even the rivals. At times, they both can get very intense and exciting. I find both of the MCs, Hinata and Soma adorable and confident. The openings also get you hyped. Both of these are about a talent, Haikyuu!! is about volleyball, and Shokugeki no Souma is about cooking. 
You won't understand a bit what's going on in either of the anime, but the hype would really hut your g-spot. "

Both about sports, passion, deep friendship, guts and drive to achieve anything. 
Both are about sports and both have a MC who is often underestimated by other (atleast in the beggining). Well I don't think this recommendation needs very mich explanation because most people know about both of these shows and Haikyuu is just like Kuroko no Basket, a really good show about sports. "

I was reluctant at first, because personally I find volleyball boring. Yeah, it's about volleyball. But Haikyuu at the moment shows a great potential and one  of my favorite animes of this season. They both have similar plots. The main characters (In KnB Kuroko, in Haikyuu Shouyou) both are underestimated and seem like they are completely wasteful to have on a team. Both of them are short and seem weak, but inside they have an overwhelming power dwelling within them that brings their team forward. The two have a pair who are aiming to be the aces and are 1st years. The duo are dominant and work together to take down the opponent. With the few episode of Haikyuu out, I can guarantee that you will not be disappointed with this show.  read more

They both deal with main characters that were at a less prestigious school that deserve to go to a better school. And in highschool their wishes start being fulfilled. Both teams in these anime aim for nationals. Also, both of the main characters aim to be the ace of these teams. Plus, both anime have and/or are getting a second season. So as you can see, there are many similarities in these anime. 
both are very good and very equal so the sport practically changes and the characters love them both so I am recommending "
20583,205,2,"There is one similar anime recommendations for Samurai Champloo episode 23 only.-both have sports scene like volleyball and baseball but for samurai champloo is more violent for baseball only  
If relationships between the 3 main protagonists were what ""drove"" the show for you, then you might enjoy Haikyuu!! as well. Since it's about volleyball, and volleyball is a team sport, interpersonal relationships are the key in this anime. And since all the characters are multi-dimensional with their own backstories and quirks, their interactions are pure delight to watch. "

Before you say ""I don't like Sports Anime"" just hear me out. While it may seem weird to recommend Hunter x Hunter to Haikyuu, I have good reason. Haikyuu is the inspirational story of a short skinny volleyball player aspiring to be one of the best in the country. So how does Haikyuu relate to Hunter x Hunter?Great Character DevelopmentAll Characters (including side characters) are distinct and not genericThe Music (just go onto YouTube and search up Haikyuu ost)And the Goosebumps you get from the badass momentsThough they don't share the same genre and don't share a lot of traits, I believe Haikyuu is worth a shot.TL;DR Expand your horizons, stop watching Shonen Anime and give Haikyuu a try read more "
20583,21,2,"If I were to describe Haikyuu!! in a single sentence to a friend, I'd call it the One Piece of Sports anime. Everyone knows One Piece. One Piece is an action anime that revolves around a no-name pirate who dreams big, makes an impact will not falter in his goal, has friends/crewmates who argue and get into funny situations (and pull hilarious faces) and much more in a epic story with some rivals and villains that you can't help but love because each character is so unique. And that also describes Haikyuu!! pretty well, too. Just replace ""action"" with ""volleyball"", ""no-name pirate"" with ""short guy who can jump"" and ""crewmates"" with ""teammates"". (And take out villains.) read more 
At first glance, these shows probably seem completely different. But the thing about both shows that draws you in is the cast. The characters and their chemistry with each other. I found that whenever I watched an episode of One Piece, I was reminded of Haikyuu and its characters. Both are very funny, and if you like character development and fun interactions between characters, both shows are great! "
20583,22135,2,"Facing obstacles and embracing the love of a sport, both series captures the essence of growth as it chronicles the journey characters go through to reach stardom. The characters go through tough experiences and learns from their mistakes from both series. And while they focus on different sports, there’s a similar feeling when it comes to the competitions. I recommend both of these series for sports fans especially those looking for a show that has appreciable development. 
The incredible passion they both have to purely win and enjoy the game. Along with the the way they gradually enhanced their skills in their sport. "
170,245,8,"both animes are from the 90's hence they have the same art style. both main characters are delinquents trying to change to be good. they are very funny and memorable characters and will make you come back for more. 
It's not GTO at all, and the theme is different, but the two main characters resemble each other greatly. These two anime have the same feel and pacing to them. 
if you watch GTO for onizuka, you'll  probably like sakuragi hanamichi. Hanamichi is as dumb as, as direct as, as insane as, as inhuman as, as simple minded as Onizuka. Two of them approach to events is so funny and direct.Hanamichi<=Onizuka... 
If you enjoy Slam Dunk, you will likely enjoy GTO and vice versa. They are both classic anime comedies with a large fan base. Well written characters that you can't help but love and cheer for and a hooking plot that keeps you coming back for more. There are lessons to be learned and inspiring moments to be had in both animes. Overall, similar art and feel as well but this is also characteristic of the times when the animes were made. 
The main viibes from the main character are more than similar to Onizuka. Both of them are quite idiots but reliable when needed 
Similar comedy, both are circled around delinquents that try to find success one way or another in the real world. Mostly importantly, both are amazing and very enjoyable. 
SCHOOL SETTING WITH ECCENTRIC MALE LEAD. You can feel a strong and funny friendship in both 
Both are some of the greatest 90's classics, would definitely recommend to check out both anime and manga series as they are both incomplete adaptations. "
170,20583,7,"Protagonist-Raw talented individual whose ability is jumping and almost infinite stamina. Both protagonist are very lively and emotional individuals. Rival- Extremely talented individual who at first believe they can single-handedly win the game. Both anime shows how these individuals grow into a better sportsmen. 
first anime that pop in my head when watching slam dunk is this one 
""Slam Dunk"" and ""Haikyuu!!"" have overall the same plot and characters. They don't focus only on the sport but also have a lot of comedy and drama.Basically they're about a first-year high school student that enters a sports club having natal ability but no experience and has to get along with a very talented, egocentric ""rival"" in the same team who thinks that he can win just by himself. The personalities and roles of the other characters are extremely alike as well, if not exactly the same.Both tell the story of a somewhat now weakened team that aims to glory with the new first-year members, who play an important place in it. read more 
When I started watching Haikyuu I got instant flashbacks of Slam Dunk, because they hold extremely important and clear similarities.Both stories handle a red-headed energetic boy who isn't very good at sports but is eager to improve (despite being for very different reasons at first).Both protagonists have to work with another first-year who they don't get along with very well (and are considered as rivals) but in the end they manage to click and work together efficiently.Both stories hold similar team dynamics: a weakened team that becomes unstoppable thanks to the new first years additions (Karasuno - Shohoku), same region rival team with a prodigy player (AobaJousai with Oikawa - Ryonan with Sendoh) ... and it goes on.Also worth mentioning how realistically both sports are depicted and played, and even allowing the viewer to learn about them as the episodes progress. All of this alongside wonderful character developments and backstories, the emotional struggles of wins and losses, and filled with great light-hearted comedy. read more 
both sports, very dynamic, without forced protagonism, haikyuu learned a lot with slam dunk and did better because hakyuu has better production ambos esportes ,muito dinamicos,sem protagonismo forçado,haikyuu aprendeu muito com slam dunk e fez melhor ,pois hakyuu tem produçao melhor 
*Both of the main characters have the same jersey with the number 10, Lol*Both of the main characters have amazing talent that center in there jumping height, speed and huge amount of stamina.*They both work hard to reduce what they lack the most.*They have a rival which may or may not count as tsundere xD*Jokes aside their rivals are both really ""hateful"" to them, but get along with them sometimes, and manage to work together efficiently.*Both series stay true to their sport, no weird super human moves or extreme physics defying powers :P*Both anime's gives you great tips about working together as a team, and they both have really nice, and somewhat realistic techniques which you can use in real life (both personally helped me a lot in sports).*Both almost made me cry at the last episode ...

Both of these anime are in the sport genre and they have this encouraging feeling that makes you want to play sports after watching how they plan and enjoy their game. "
170,263,4,"Well you probably wondering how come this two anime's are similar ?The answer is quite simple, in both the main characters are new in the field of the sport they ""playing"", and were they are trying to become one of the best!Also a lot of delinquents action so the figthing is mutual in both anime's :)And must not forget the comedy that is present, it's probably better than in some animes that are focused on only that ! :) 
they both start from zero and  learn technic`s and fight their way to top,,,they both funny with original staff,,,the both of them is one of best anime history :D 
Both of animes talk about sports(Hajime = boxing, slam dunk = basketball) and has a main character that joins their respective sports and evolve during the animation. 
Both are shounen anime that focus on sports: Slam Dunk is about basketball, while Hajime no Ippo is about boxing. They are character-driven stories, which create similar moods: both have a lot of funny scenes and intense matches. Also, many characters in these anime have similar personalities (and some of them are even delinquents). "
170,16894,2,"Slam Dunk and Kuroko no Basket are both sports genre anime, and as you can see, both of the anime's main subject is basketball. Kuroko no Basket's similar to Slam Dunk as because the anime both shows a competition or tournament within the region. The only difference of this shows is that; Slam Dunk is more on reality, while Kuroko no Basket is not realistic, the anime shows some weird basketball technique's which is impossible for people to do unlike Slam Dunk. Another thing why I should recommend Slam Dunk is that also has a great art, great story and great soundtracks. 
Both series are very similar :- both are sports genre, specificately both are about basketball- both have great art- both have great OST- both have great characters etc...If you liked one of them you would like the other for sure !! "

21,11061,55,"Personally i'm a huge OP fan since more than a decade and i have to say that it took me a while before actually giving a try to HxH 'cuz i wasn't sure if i would've liked it.. But. Woah against my expectations i really did like it more than i thought! Truth is that after i gave it a try, i couldn't stop watching it. The more i was seeing it and the more it was giving me the same feeling that OP gives me. They have the same vibe and have the power to let you enjoyed more and more, this way your curiousity level also grows bigger and bigger by each episode. They really share a lot in common:• first off: well, the genres, as you can see they both are Shonen, Adventure, Action, Superpowers genres.• both main charas would look the ""typical protagonists of a shonen serie"" but they actually are able to surprise you, the more you get to know about them and their personalities.• interesting enough, both protagonists' fathers seems to play a very important role (i would even dare to say ""legendary""), plus obviously are very strong and full of mystery• both stories are about dreams and all that takes to our main charas to realize them. In HxH, obviously, Gon wants to become an hunter; while in OP Luffy wants to become a pirate, but not just a normal one, he wants to become THE pirate King. In addition, their companions of both Gon and Luffy also have an ambition/purpose they want to achieve as well.• both series face the adventure with a long Journey splitted in many arcs.• still, both give a huge importance to friendship.• let's not forget to mention that both of them are quite cured, as of course, like the protagonists, also the other characters in the series are intriguingly developed for the best together with their backgrounds, their actions and personalities.• last but not least, the presence of the superpowers genre won't disappoint you either because ""from big powers come big... battles!"", yes, indeed lots of cool battles and the more you find out of the stories and the more you'll get interested by the way to fight! In HxH we have the ""Nen"" (Aura) and in OP we have the ""Haki"" (Ambition).. you'll really be amazed by the coolness of the battles!As you can see a lot of stuff is a common point for those two series.The only thing left me to say is: I seriously recommend both series, because they both worth it.If you liked one of them, you'll probably love the another as well.Because afterall, they both share one last significant thing: greatness. read more 
Gon and Luffy have similar personalities.Characters all have their own fighting style that they work on through the series, as well as their own goals. They both go through several arcs where the protagonist grows little by little. Both are on-going shounens. 
Both have a young boy leaving home to explore the world and become the best in it, they both have dreams they would sacrifice their lives for, happy positive outlooks on every situation, a selection of nakama/friends who they would do anything to protect.Both have comedy, action, fighting, adventure, challenges, friendship and a feel good vibe. If you're a one piece fan i definitely recommend hunter x hunter, and vice versa. 
An ambitious and particularly strong young boy setting on a journey in a vast mysterious world, full of unexplored lands and strange creatures. There he meets friends and face various dangers and enemies in order to fulfill his dream.I would say that One Piece is more about adventure while HxH is more about battle. Maybe HxH is a bit darker too, and OP funnier, but both are great shows. 
Both anime are similar in the themes of adventure, comedy and friendship.The main characters are also similar in personality, with Luffy being more silly than Gon. There are also lots of interesting side characters and powers presented in both shows. 
The adventure,comedy and feelings are all the same. Fighting for the nakama's by putting your life in danger. Its a must watch if you loved One Piece.Everyone have different powers like in one piece there are devil fruits.I don't know how to recommend anime's but I'm sure you will love Hunter X Hunter if you loved One Piece.  
Gon and Luffy are very similar protagonists. They go on an adventure and make many friends along the way. The feeling of adventure that One Piece conveys is also found very often in Hunter x Hunter. Both shows have a vast world that draws you in and makes you want to learn more about it. Both shows can become much darker than a traditional shonen at some points. If you like One Piece, it's almost certain you will like Hunter x Hunter. 
Both series are long running (lots of episodes) series that center around action and fighting. The main characters are very good and the stories are very profound.  Both characters have lost their families and are on a quest to become the strongest. They have to struggel and give their all to achieve this, wich is why the series is so amazing to watch as you can see them develop episode after episode. 
These are Jump's two greatest ongoing battle shonen. Both have massive worlds filled with numerous unique and like able characters. Both revolve around adventure and a charismatic MC that gains many allies along the way. If you are a fan of shonen (hell, if you are a fan of anime) then you should watch both of these. 
Both are shonen anime that each have their fair share of adventures and fights. Both series have hyper, dumb, and funny main characters that are very interesting. The art in both series is also done very well. 
While One Piece starts a lot slower than HxH (I'd recommend picking up at the Water 7 arc if you're impatient), and while its overall world and magic system is a lot more crazier and cartoony, it's definitely got the same sort of landmark effect on the heart, with tons of emotional moments, epic fights, characters that stay with you, and arcs that only get better and better as you go on.  
Both main characters (Luffy and Gon) are looking for something in particular and it is said at the beginning of the series.Side characters have somewhat similar goals. This can be seen mostly with Leori and Nami since they both want money. 
-Both shows (in my opinion) start off decent and get better and better to the point of awesomeness. -The concept of nen and haki are similar, plus both are introduced later on in the series. -They are your typical shounen anime where the protagonist protect his friends and get stronger. Both have superpowers(main characters are very strong and op, altho luffy is more op then gon) -characters aren't that similar but the relationships between characters are- Both have the friendship theme, though it's more present in one piece-both are currrently airing and prob won't end anytime soon 
Both anime are filled with adventured arcs consisting of interesting development with characters and introducing new foundations of abilities each character posses. This is a must watch! 
The best Battle Shounen already created. The best seller! Absolutely no one overcomes this One Piece. What enchants me most in this anime is a story that is exciting making you reach the point of tears. Its plot is perfect, everything connects, making their fans create several theories about the story. His universe is infinite, thus making it all happen or anything appear following its own logic.His pace is slow and it is one of the causes of many episodes, but worth every minute spent with this masterpiece. Another strong point is the comedy that will surely make you a good laugh. 
the main characters so much alike....luffy and gon they both are innocent and well their personality is extremely alike....they both are in a hunt while gon is looking for his dad,luffy is looking for the treasure,and there are awesome adventures...while luffy has a crew with their own goals in one piece,gon's friends also have their own seprate goals but somehow they get along... 
Gon, the main character, has some very strong similarities to Luffy when Luffy gets serious and the variety of powers and abilites of characters in this anime is similar to One Piece's devil fruit power variety. There are some AWESOME fights in this anime just like in One Piece and you will feel connected and cheer for the characters just like you do for the Straw Hat crew. Hunter x Hunter 2011 and One Piece are my two favorite anime. Please this anime is a great use of your time; it wont disappoint.  
After watching the masterpiece one piece the only other thing that gave me the same feel was no other than hunter x hunter. In both of the anime the protagonist is a reckless guy who goes out on a journey to gain something that they want. During the adventure both of the protagonists meet many different kinds of people and go through different experiences and learn from that. Both of the series are extremely enjoyable and are worth watching. 
Originating in shonen jump, and serialized practically a year apart, both mangas have been adapted into successful long running animes that have an excellent cast of characters, world building, and fantastic adventures.They both still have plenty of stories to tell in an ever expanding universe, while still keeping pretty consistent rules previously established, power levels, foreshadowing, never forgetting characters, and building off of the huge casts to create more amazing arcs. Most of the time, both shows are character driven.While both are shonen, both are so tonally different, yet they go in hand in hand with the way they blur the two sides of good and evil - Hunters being hunters, seeking out everything the world has to offer, and pirates, going against all odds to find what it truly means to be free. One Piece and Hunter x Hunter (2011) both are written differently, but in a way still have a lot in common. I guess the closest thing I can compare them to are Peanut & Butter haha. Anyways, give both of these stories a watch and even if they may not hook you quickly, stick with it and it'll be worth the wait. Don't skip arcs because a lot of tiny details said maybe even 50 or 100s of episodes ago usually turn up 200x more important in the long run. read more 
If you liked the odd as hell character designs and straight forward plot in One Piece then your'e prone to enjoying hunter x hunter 
Both anime create a huge world with many fantastic aspects from wild creatures/people to unusual places. Hunter x Hunter is shorter but has higher quality episodes whereas One Piece spreads itself over God knows how many more episodes but does not loose in telling a great adventure story. Both give you different emotions (joy, sadness, thrill, hope) overtime as you become part of the main crew. One Piece might be harder to start due to the number of episodes but every arc is worth it in the end. Enjoy Watching! :D 
If you are watching one piece you will really like hunter x hunter also. Both anime have incredible good characters voices and both have badazz old man that will make you cry of badass-ness xDDNETERO WHITEBEARD etc 
They are both about adventure and the main character is young boy who's a simpleton. The second main character is the cool one  who's not afraid to kill. Also the main character ,Gon, shares a lot of similarities to Goku and there's a ton of DBZ references in Hunter x Hunter. The Best part about Hunter x Hunter and the reason as to why i like it more than One Piece is that people die in HxH. 
Similar adventure style with lots of action, and mainly features around the protagonist (Gon in HXH and Luffy and his crew in One Piece). Like how Gon's goal was to become a Hunter etc, Luffy's goal is to become the pirate king, so they both have that similar sort of drive as characters. 
Both anime are shounen with super powers, fight scenes, friends and adventure.Both have funny and sad scenes.Both have a carefree and a little bit stupid protagonists.Both have badass characters and epic moments. 
Both really great animes that I love, if you like One Piece, you should definitely watch Hunter X Hunter. If you like Shounen, this is the way to go. Luffy and Gon have adventures and fun while still striving towards their goal- Pirate King and the best Hunter. Although they may seem to be fooling around, when push comes to shove they are great friends you'd definitely want watching your back. Both anime have great side characters and plots. I would totally watch Hunter X Hunter! 
-The most creative worlds in anime-Lovable characters with somewhat unattractive designs (at least different from normal)-Soundtrack gives the shows a similar feel 
Diverse world with changing settings, excellent fight scenes, and a diverse and interesting cast of characters. 
These 2 are one of the most popular long running shounen and are both really fun shows. filled with likable characters, interesting plot, and are adventurous. also my top long running shounens! 
Lighthearted anime with exciting fighting arc's (beware of filler episodes - HxH has less fillers).Innocent and ambigious main character with badass friends, interesting side characters and a lot of plot twists.In search for something very important to them. Friendship is the key.(Adventure, Action, Fantasy, Superpower, Shounen). 
HunterxHunter is very similar in terms of what you like. I love both of these series even if they are shounen. They both can be really dark in certain moments, but overall these two are really good 
Both main characters are young with high potential ! 
both of these anime have  amazing action and adventure experience and shows an unbreakable bond of friendship 
Hunter x Hunter is an amazing shonen anime about a boy named Gon who leaves his home to take on one of the toughest jobs in the world, being a hunter. No, he's not hunting deer or rabbits, he's looking for his dad, whom he hasn't seen since he was a baby. On the way, he meets Leorio, Kurapika, and Killua, who help him on his journey.I've loved this show ever since I discovered it in 2014. It's got great animation, compelling characters, and great story arcs. If you like the first Hunter Exam arc, you'll probably like the rest. 
While this is super long running, it has the same adventure vibes as HxH. Although instead of hunters, the focus is on pirates. overall, if you're into long running adventures and love to binge watch, you'll be able to get caught up with One Piece in a cinch 
Both are great shounen series.great stories.longer arcsawesome powers.great character development 
Started at kind, lovely atmosphere then it turns into more serious atmosphere. The characters want adventure and stronger as many stronger enemies will appear. 
Both are battle manga with have a focus on friendship, and the two Mcs would do anything to help their friends. 
Both are great anime that have: - Huge and great world building.- Group of friends that are going on an entertaining adventure and etcIf you like one of them you will like the other. 
Both shounen action series with intricate world building and delve into various character studies. 
Adventurous and with great story telling. Smart action and side characters have their times in the spotlight. 
-you'll love the series instantly-the main characters are great-the storyline is very interesting-amazing fights 
One piece is like the light hearted version of hunter x hunter and is highly similar to the series in terms of plot. If you enjoyed one piece and are looking for a heavier adventure hxh is for you. While if you liked hxh and are looking for a more carefree adventure the one piece is for you. 
Both are top notch shounen anime. Usually we can see that whatever the genre of an anime is there is a bit romance in the story line. But Hunter X Hunter and One piece are anime where there is no specifically romance and both of the mc are adventure lovers. They work and struggle towards their goals.Like Luffy is a boy who wants to be a pirate king and Gon is a boy who wants to be a great hunter to know why his dad abandoned him for being a hunter. That's all. Both of the anime is quite good.  
Both are adventurous and travel the world.  
- Large, open world: plenty of worldbuilding in each story- Adventure-based plot line- Wide Character Cast- Fighting isn't always just brawling: it's also about being shrewd, intelligent, calculating and deceptive- Dangerous and unique supernatural abilities- The protagonist seems naive, but has an air of mystery about them that foreshadows something about their true side 
""Hunter x Hunter"" is one of the relics of the manga and anime world, which places us under the watchful eye of Gon Freecss. This young protagonist has a goal that, like Luffy, will make him embark on a long journey. As one of the anime similar to ""One Piece"", then, we will see Gon overcoming all kinds of adversities in order to become a 'hunter', a title that receives a select group of individuals to which his father belongs, who abandoned him from Too small to become the standout of all hunters. So, those who have enjoyed moments like Luffy realizing that they were no match for Kuma, or stories like that of Sanji and the Vinsmokes, will find in ""Hunter x Hunter"" a narrative that is also the best in the whole panorama of the shounen. read more 
Similar deep themes and both have incredible antagonists. in my opinion, OP is one of only two shonen that comes close to being as good as hxh.(the other being FMAB) 
-great storylines and arcs - great battle systems- loveable characters   
They both have a good and enjoyable storyline and if you like Hunter then you will also enjoy One Piece 
Both main characters have a similar journey, and the story can be overall similar. 
The emotions in both anime hit close to the heart in a way I have yet to see in other battle shonen to the degree of talent that they are down in either of these two animes.The depth of worldbuilding in One Piece is a step above the greatness that exists in Hunter x Hunter, so there's a bonus in that regard.If you enjoyed the sense of family that exists in HxH between characters like Gon, Killua, Kurapika, and all the other loveable characters, you get that same attachment with fellow Straw Hat recruits and even what appears as minor side characters at first still manage to get you caring about them.The action in HxH is great and honestly hard to beat, but that's not to say One Piece doesn't have its fair share of action, while not on par with HxH, they are still a treat to watch and have gotten better as the anime progressed. read more 
Both contents are based on the aim of the main characters. One of them wants to see his father and other one wants to be Pirate King and both characters have strong determination to reach their aim. I'm sure that all spectators will admire their both determination. Also main characters are good-hearted, cheerful and childish for each animes. Moreover, side characters also well thought and varied for both of them. Some pieces of their lives of the side characters are being shared in both animes, with this way you might connect to the frames of mind of the almost all characters with pleasure.The only bad thing of Hunter X Hunter which is release date. New episodes are being added slow. read more 
It's also shonen, although this is longer and has way too much episodes. This will keep you up at night. The fights are really good, and if you like shonen genre then this might be the one for you too just like hunter x hunter.  
One Piece has always been great when it comes to a good challenge—especially a good fight! Another show that certainly has this element is Hunter x Hunter. To be a hunter is a huge privilege and you need to take the Hunter Exam in order to pass. The only catch? There's an extremely low success rate and it's pretty dangerous. Gon Freecss is out to become a Hunter so he can find his missing father. "
21,136,10,"Just as One Piece,Hunter x hunter is a pretty long shounen anime,both series can be really funny at times ,you will never get bored and always want to see the next episode,both anime have some awesome fights and also the characters are very likable,if you enjoy one of this anime you will most probably like the other one too. 
These two shounen animes are the best of their genre, and im sure anyone who's liked one, will definetly like the other. 
Long running series like One Piece. The main characters have typical characteristics, fun and yet intuitive. You will definitely enjoy this anime 
Both are popular manga that run in the same magazine. They have similar styles and a wide cast of characters. They also have plenty of action and a darker side to the adventure. 
The way that main charcter are not botherin you (like Naruto forex) and the respect that you feal towards Gon, Killua, Hisoka and others in this great anime is somewhat similar to One Piece series 
Both main characters are tremendously similar. Both stubborn, with hidden strong sides, happy-go-lucky attitudes and  they are really single minded. While Luffy goes for the title of Pirate king Gon chases the title of Hunter, with friends that will follow them through the deepest and most dangerous adventures.  
Super engaging/amusing/touching Epic Quest fantasy with a ton of awesome characters. 
One of the easiest recommendations ever. Hunter x Hunter and One Piece deliver top notch emotion and character development, that it's just hard to even avoid them. Any shounen fan should have seen these two animes, because they're bound to love them.  
Both are about adventures and fights and magical things, HxH is  more mature and also way more violent though, it also avoids all the cliche moments seen in most shonen making it more original.I recommend watching the 2011 version for now 
1. Long adventures2. Great action3. Nice plot4. Amazing fight scenes5. Lots of content when you are done with the anime "
21,918,10,"Gotta love the slapstick comedy. ^_^ One Piece has more of a story whereas Gintama is just comedic, but both very funny and enjoyable. 
both main character are very carefree but when serious they are extremely strong. unlike naruto or some other main stream or so, gintama and one piece doesn't have a side talk/story since no one really like it and get on with the main point. although gintama doesn't really have a main point to the story besides the comedy and fighting that randomly occurs 
One piece by story and funny characters similar to gintama TV series but it will never be Gintama :) 
They both have similar storytelling methods. Both animes hardly take themselves seriously and crack joke after joke, but they have serious moments where the viewer can really connect to the characters. 
Both of them, are the #1 Shounen Manga, and the most entertaining animes, ever both have an amazing willpower,if you are a one piece fan boy, try Gintama 
Both are long seriesBoth are comediesBoth have intense actionBoth have a lot of meaningful storiesand both have a lot of deep stories and plot 
-Similar comedic style, though obviously Gintama focuses more on it-Both have characters that make the large amount of episodes worth it-Both dwell into the themes of 'protecting your nakama' more naturally than other shonen 
Sure... there's a large difference, but both are on the masterpiece level both are very comedic and there is action in both animes .Do know that the first Episodes might be slow or average for many people. So it could be for you as well. But it will improve a lot afterwards. 
The humor in both of these anime is amazing. Main characters are both easy-going, but very serious when they need to be. Both shows have a great variety of interesting characters with different powers. Villains are very developed and some make a return later in the series. 
Its long, funny, has a well thought out cast, although nothing can really be similar to one piece, this is another good and long show that you can watch without having any boredom, lots of good fights, comedy and hype surrounding the anime. "
21,2001,6,"Both are great shonen series.of the best.Friendship,Loyalty,Courage are really important.Also they say that you have to fight for your dreams.And the Gurren Brigade has somehow the  same feeling as Luffy's crew x] 
These two are quite possibly the most ultimate examples of emotionally powerful, but insanely awesome, anime (with superb dubbing to boot). 
It'd be a spoiler to say the main reason I think these two are alike - but that aside, both have similar values in friendship (nakama) and family.And both will absolutely blow your mind with story, and action sequences that'll have your blood pumping the whole way through!PROTIP: Watch it. 
Same amount of epicnes and action ,same humor style if i can said it and the girls have the same boovs somehow anyway they dont have the same story or the animation but  can if you like one you surely love Gurren Lagann but if you like Gurren Lagann is not that you ll like one piece 
A group of friends striving to achieve their goals, although One Piece is a little more light-hearted 
both are kinda old school and when I say ""old school"" I mean the old episodes from One Piece, don't get my wrong new episodes are very good but I just love the old ones. OK so down to the point One piece has action goofy style and so does gurren lagann both have the serious moments and some not so serious,all in all I love both and recommend them for they hours of entertainment they gave me. "

I'm surprised this hasn't been recommended yet. Both are alluring and dark, taking the average person into a world of chaos, crime and justice. Both appeal to a mature audience and dabble with a bit of the super power. one piece is set in a far natural version of sea while from the new world is present day. Amazing seiyuu tomokazu sugita and hiroaki HIRATA play male leads in both. one piece' main focus is funny and Pirates while shinsekai yori is gang violence and the not so ordinary lives of three old.  "

In my opinion  One punch man has the best animation i've ever seen. One punch man is a much shorter serie, it doesnt have as good as a story as one punch man. Not as great as character development as one piece does. BUT, one piece is one of a kind. No serie out there that I've seen comes near the adventureous and unique story of one piece. So dont try too hard finding a serie that does. Try One punch man instead and if you were looking for great comedy, great fight scenes and awesome animation.

The main characters seem to be immature and irresponsible at first, but when the right time comes, they turn out to be badass. While one of them aspires to be the pirate king and collects crew mates, the other eyes to be the greatest chef. As more episodes go by, the series and characters grow to become more mature and serious; the series start off kind of slow and overly immature, but once they get going they are both really interesting and rather addictive. Whatever you do, don't overlook these anime series because of the fillers or the characters in the beginning! read more "
21,16498,2,"I am actually surprised that no one have recommended One Piece to people who liked Shingeki no Kyojin!One Piece and SNK are very similar, despite the difference in pacing, amount of tough violence, number of episodes and overall tone. The story of the two are about accepting the world, beating the unbeatable opponents and taking care of your loved ones. As tough as SNK is, it has always been about the dreams of those characters, their struggle to live and succeed, to be the ""best worst generation"", something that One Piece is always so good at!I've actually started watching One Piece after I've watched 2 seasons of SNK, so I was able to catch the moments where you can just tell that the mangaka of SNK liked it so much that he took some of the ideas from OP and reworked them in SNK.As of violence, I'd say that the violence in SNK is not the lustful one, it's there to move the story and not to satisfy someone's desire for blood and gore, the Titans action doesn't strike you as disgusting because of their perfect visual design and the way SNK shows the violent things. One Piece might not look like it has any tough moments, battles at first but the series progresses throughout its course and things are never the same.One Piece and Shingeki no Kyojin are these two anime that are always going to make me happy and I do encourage you to take your time and enjoy One Piece. No skipping any of the episodes, no rewinding; just try to sit back, relax and get used the the way One Piece tells its stories. I can promise that if you will be fully open and patient, One Piece will most likely be the best thing to happen with you in terms of anime. read more

Although both shows have that standard shonen theme flowing through the story and characters, Rainbow tends to be more mature in expressing that brotherly bond, whereas GL is more lively and animated. If you liked Rainbow's passionate portrayal of brotherhood, then you might like Gurren Lagann. 
Sakuragi is like 50's realitites Kamina and Mario - Simon 
Unbreakable bonds, everlasting friendships, and seemingly impossible goals. The Rainbow and the Spiral are one of the same. 
-Characters look up to their ""Bro"" and follow his example.-""Bro"" character is super manly and teaches the other character important lessons about friendship and hard work.-There is a time skip halfway that shows their lives after the first ""fight"" ends.-One younger character strives to be just like ""Bro"" and others start to see how much he resembles ""Bro"" later on.-Friendship, teamwork, manliness, and some super dramatic scenes 
When your heart is broken, your soul destroyed, piece it back together with the bonds of friendship! Break through the heavens! Believe in the Bro that believes in you! Rainbow and TTGL have vastly different settings though share similar themes and ideals to help showcase its larger than life characters on their coming of age journey.  
Both shows contain a older brother-like relationship, friendship and coming of age. These both show are complete different. But shares the same morals. 
-Both have a leader to some sort of team-The leader and main character have extremely similar relationships in both-Both have great character development-Both climax midway through but despite this, keep going 
At first glance, these two might not be similar, but both are about the endurance of the human spirit and the importance of friendship in harsh times. As well, both feature an inspiring big brother figure whose way of thinking touches the main characters throughout the series, as well as people he hasn't even met.Rainbow is definitely more realistic than Gurren Lagann, but both have a tendency to be uplifting.

Gritty, realistic, dark, depressing, but somehow also uplifting. Both of these shows do an excellent job of fleshing out their worlds and characters, and are fantastic period pieces. They show the darkest depths of the human mind, and while they are often very grim and sometimes hard to stomach, they also have a softer, light side that makes you appreciate the characters even more. They both have lots of moral and philosophical questions to ask. They also have similar art styles (both made by Madhouse). 
They are both deep anime more for adults and with a taste of shitty situations shitty world but also a satisfying bright side of life 
Monster and Rainbow both tell dark and dramatic stories but ultimately have uplifting messages of good people doing good things in bad situations. They both have realistic tone and realistic characters, and Rainbow reminded me very much of Monster in this regard. The characters are excellent, and each character has their own perspective in the story similar to how Monster follows the perspective of several main characters. The characters have a depth of humanity to them in each of these series that so few anime attain. Each of these stories are about completely different scenarios, one an non-linear crime thriller, the other a prison drama, but the tone, realism, and quality of the story and characters reach a certain note that made me appreciate Rainbow in many of the ways that I appreciated Monster. read more 
Story wise, they're very far apart, but both shows have a dark and gritty atmosphere, and both delve into the darker side of life and the human condition. The stories told in each are mature and intelligent, and the cast of characters are very strongly written and well-developed for the most part.  
Story-wise, both of these shows aren't that similar. Monster is a psychological crime drama while Rainbow is a show of a group of inmates trying to live a regular life outside of prison. However they are both gritty, realistic, and some-what calming.-Both of these shows have a large array of amazing characters who get substantial amounts of character-development. Not only that, but they both shows perspective on several characters throughout the anime, making each and every character memorable.-Both show that the world is filled with jerks, but also kind people.Both shows are similar to each other in terms of character writing and portraying how people are realistically.

Both anime have the ""scum of society"" as their protagonists. Both deal with the cruelty of those in higher position. Both anime contain a high amount of tears. Both anime feature the value of trust in your comrades, although Rainbow is much more idealistic about it.Their premise is different, but the two shows are thematically very similar. 
Do you like anime with very realistic design / story and character? Do you want to watch a true seinen with true social issues ? Do you want a story so sad and tearing that you will weep like a baby ? So watch both, there are amazing shows for these, even if they sensibly not develop same universe type (Kaiji evolved in a gambling / money world while guys of Rainbow are in jail) but are related with thematics.  
Both series share a similar art style in the sense that everything looks sturdy and heavily outlined, and both are sausage fests with casts mostly made up of male characters. Both series make you root for the protagonists as they are thrown into despair and struggle through impossible situations, with the high points of each show feeling exhilarating, and the lows feeling like bottomless pits. I think both Kaiji and Rainbow share the same feeling of tension and high stakes which is why I recommend them. 
Both stories follow a group of characters trying to get out of miserable/desperate situations. The primary antagonists of the series are very similar in terms of their sadistic nature. Throughout the series, the protagonists are seemingly offered ways out of their dire circumstances by the antagonists, but those chances are often intended to merely provide false hope to the protagonists. Both series have a very ""hard-boiled""/""bad-ass"" vibe to them. Both were produced by Madhouse in the late 2000s and have fairly similar animation styles.   "

Both series have self reliance in common. FMA shows you the darker side of life and 2 brothers overcoming it. Then there is this series. Be warned it not for the light hearted. I was forced to drop this series after episode 2 because I could not take my heart strings being abused like that.Deep emotions will be felt. You must be ready for them. 
They teach you a lesson why familiy and friends are important, they both have some cruel scenes. "
6114,37779,2,"Both series includes being locked in a certain place and the characters attempts to escape from there. Though in Rainbow it doesn't include supernatural beings like Demons. 
Both shows have hard-hitting drama and a story about companionship blossoming in the face of corrupt authority and the hardships such bonds can bring. Rainbow:Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin is a more conventional character drama with a thriller undertone and some historical elements whereas Yakusoku no Neverland is a psychological-horror thriller through and through with more ""targeted"" drama and supporting mystery elements. If you grew attached to the characters in Neverland I suspect Rainbow will be right up your alley and vice versa if you enjoyed the beginning of Rainbow the most Neverland will not disappoint you. "

Either prison walls or city walls.- They must fight against a bigger, stronger force to be free- Making plans to fight against the bad- Teamwork- Cruel scenes. If you don't mind cruelty and want to see something deeper meaning - both shows are worth it.  
Young people band together to face the monsters and challenges of their worlds.  Titan has more action and a supernatural element, but both are thrilling stories of struggle, fighting back, and wanting revenge with a somewhat realistic ambiance.               "

What first got me thinking about it was the background music it sounds pretty much the same, also the art work (some characters from Rainbow do look like some characters from Nana). But ultimatly what I believe is the most resounding similarity between this too is the hoplessness, the despair, the feeling that there are just some things you cannot fix, no matter how hard you try.All in all I believe if you liked Rainbow you will probably like Nana. 
The idea of starting from the bottom to rise to the top is present in both Rainbow, which features inmates of a reformatory striving for success in the real world, and Nana, where Nana Osaki strives to reach mainstream success. The sub-storyline most similar to Nana is that of Yokosuka Joh who has raw musical talent and strives to make it to the top. "
6114,12531,2,"- Similar setting and atmosphere: Mid 20th century Japan, which means the characters in these two shows face the same kind of struggles; the after-WW2-poverty and the absence of fathers for some reason or another. - Music—jazz—is present in both series, more in SnA of course. - They will give you the same warm, sad, yet beautiful feeling while watching. - Real BROMANCE, friends through good and bad who support each other more than brothers do. - Finally, I personally consider both to be bright examples of modern time classics; so wonderful and classy, a must watch for serious anime fans. 
Similar atmosphere, same feeling, similar setting, lots of drama and both takes place shortly after World War 2. If you enjoyed one, you would totally enjoy the other! "
6114,13601,2,"While Psycho-Pass revolves more around chasing a criminal and Rainbow is more about the life and friendship of seven prisoners, both series center around laws and have criminals as their main theme, and explores both themes pretty nicely. 
Rainbow is a psychological action show with a great animation and story. The show is not mainly focused on action. It also about friendship, courage, pride and about their fight against society. Psycho Pass is also a great show with a very good animation. The shows are similar because of the influence of the government. The difference is that in Rainbow it's about the seven boys and their battle against the system. In Psycho Pass, the MC's are part of the system themselves. The shows may look very different at first, but after watching them I felt they had a lot in common. "

31933,11061,4,"I've longed for another show similar to HxH. Diamond is Unbreakable comes the closest in the aspects I think are the most important:-Characters all have unique and extremely creative abilities-Fights are almost always won by quick thinking, clever application of your ability, or outsmarting your opponent, rather than the much more cliche ""willpower/brute strength/plot convenience"". -Both are fairly unpredictable - you may even know the direction the show will go, but will have no clue how it'll get there-Very likable main cast and interesting main villains 
- Normal people receiving random powers and using them not for any big cause, but for their own sake- There's no clear line between good and evil- Very good character development- Bright colors, beautiful art, unforgettable music- Unforgettable antagonists with deep character development and fully understandable reasons to act- Good exploration of the theme ""friendship"", with an acceptable number of clichés and tropes- Relatable characters, very likable main squad- Fights based on the smart use of the fighters' quirks, not only their brawns- Both are shonen from experienced and mature authors, and are considered for many to be their magna opera

Bakemonogatari and Jojo part 4 are really similar and not a lot of people seem to notice it for some reason. Both shows take place in bizarre towns with a lot of strange happenings and equally strange people. The protagonists befriends some of those said people in extremely well written arcs that introduces the characters in a perfect way that makes the story feel at least 10 times more complete.

It's quite obvious Steins;Gate fleshed out its time travel element more and in case of Re Zero it's time travel with supernatural aspect.

There are three anime that are very much similar to Shingeki no Kyojin, Berserk, Claymore, and Hokuto no Ken. I would say out of the 3 Berserk is the one most similar. So I recommend it as have many others and this is a very valid recommendation.  
The concept of fighting and blood being spilled in a dark fantasy world is a theme presented in both Berserk and Shingeki no Kyojin (aka Attack on Titan)There is a moody atmosphere in both series that also involves a lot of action, drama, and emotions between the main characters. It conveys imagery in a way that is violent but fits within the fantasy realm of its medieval like settings.The monsters in both series are also considered a dangerous threat to mankind; survival is a must. 
It has that medieval feel to it as well as all despair, no happiness. Both cause a lot of suffering to the viewer. 
Both series tell a story set in a world where humanity is on the losing side in a war against overwhelmingly powerful and monstrous foes and prospects for the future look as bleak as the present situation. Unless, of course, the heroes of each tale, rise to lead humanity in fighting back against these malevolent and horrifying enemies. 
Both have shocking imagery, are set in medieval settings, have relatively realistic characters with realistic responses and actions, use monsters as symbols of fear, and are awesome.  
Both have similar settings with an abundance of violence and gore. Death and mortality are both common themes. They both focus on a battle between violent creatures (titans/demons). Prominent battle scenes and intense combat make both series engaging and entertaining. 
The main characters are both beasts who overcome obstacles through force of will. Full of action and refreshingly neither are harems or have harem aspects, i.e. the fighting in both is gruesome and is paced well, so there is no boredom and no filler.   
Dark, gritty, and violent anime set in realistic medieval-ish times with doses of dark fantasy. Includes suffering, betrayal, shocking plot twists, great action, amazing storytelling, and all time great soundtracks. 
Both anime are quite horrifying and have some great characters; many of which are absolute badasses. Both have a similar supernatural role in them--whether that be demons are titans. If you like one of them, you'll most likely enjoy the other because of similar dark themes and surprises. "
33,19,9,"""That which does not kill us makes us stronger."" Friedrich NietzcheWhy are humans at the epitome of all biodiversity? We have the ability to think, we have the ability to reflect, we have the ability to dream. How about Miura's Berserk and Urasawa's Monster?Alhough dissimilar in plot content wise and settings wise, both Berserk and Monster attempted, and did portray: Human nature. Griffith, a power-hungry, though passionate sociopath, rises up the ranks through cunning and despicable ways, concealed by his charisma and charm. Johan, driven by his lust of power and control over humans, has emerged out of the horrors of living hell to become a monster. Both ""antagonists"" are extremely charismatic, manipulative, decisive, unrelenting and ""seductive"" individuals; they are willing to discard and sacrifice everything in order to achieve their goals. However, both shows feature a different perspective to that end, portraying a sympathetic view to both ""adversaries"". Ironically, both titles feature a unique twist of fate to that end, at the same time.At first glance, Guts and Doctor Tenma look so unalike in physique that one may even say that they live in different planets. Yet, there is a striking resemblance between the two protagonists. Dr. Tenma Kenzo, a talented neurosurgeon working in West Germany, made the greatest ""mistake"" in life by reviving a 'monster', and sought to clear up his sin by eliminating it once and for all. Whereas for Guts, his appearance in the Band of the Hawk became the definitive factor of Griffith's ambition, and Guts' realisation became his resolution to defeat Griffith once and for all.And yes, there is a sad story behind the distinct titles and genres for both series. The pace and the development of the plots slowly surface the ""truth"", similar in Monster and Berserk alike.One cannot help but find these titles similar, when recalled upon. Given the  episode count that may frighten off people before watching it, don't. 74 episodes of Monster is totally worth it when retelling Urasawa's Monster novel. Similarly, despite being a heavily condensed series, Berserk outshines many Anime titles out there by not just simply being a ""Gar"" show, but has its fair share of drama, and even suspense. Watch them both. Nobody regrets it. read more 
The stories are totally different, but if you look at it from Johan's or Griffith's point of view, they are quite similar. They are both pretty dark but very sad too at times.  
Both animes have:A: a seemingly perfect character (Johan or Griffith) who is in fact not as flawless as it looks like.B: another main character (Dr. Tenma or Guts) who is trying to reveal the true face of this seemingly perfect being.  
It seems far-fetched but it isn´t.The plot and the setting are nothing alike but the true themes of them both are quite similar. what is Morales? What is wrong and what is right? How does the interacting between human beings affect one another? What does it take to create a monster? And is the monster truly evil or is it a victim of its past and psyche?These are just a few of the big questions both animes ask us viewers.Of course you can watch berserk for the lesser serious themes for its actions and such on but no one can say that berserk isn´t philosophical and tells a story about psychology of the characters.Other similarities:- Both being classic animes and having a realistic art style and they have a quite realistic setting even though berserk of course becomes supernatural.- They are both slow paced and takes its time to slowly unfold the plot in a good way.- Great focus on character interactions and having a lot of other but still important characters, of course monster having the most.- Both Johann and Griffith being quite charismatic and VERY intelligent characters and one does not simply understand their ways, their goal and their point of view of the world. read more 
Different settings, however, both are rather similar. First, both shows delve deeply into human nature, explore it thoroughly. Both shows share similarly charismatic main character (Johan and Griffith). 
Both have some incredible villains, and both of the manga are extremely popular and sought after. They are both character driven, and ALL of the characters are easy to love. Neither are science fiction, and take place in varying levels of the past. Also, for either anime, prepare yourself for the ending. Without saying too much, your mouth will probably be agape by the time you're finished with either anime. Enjoy! 
Although Monster and Berserk do not share a similar setting or even a similar story they both explore human nature and dark themes such as nihilism in an explicit and serious manner. Both shows develop their themes by focusing on two characters and the interactions between them, whether direct or indirect.  
Berserk is a fantastic anime to watch if you liked Monster. While they take place in completely different environments and with different time periods, one can expect to see similarities in the humanized characters, relationships, power dynamics, and complex storyline. Despite its different medieval setting, Berserk offers diverse characters with realistic motivations. Just like Monster, it also has very interesting themes of understanding one’s identity and discovering the complexity of evil. It is one of my favorites and I highly suggest it for fans of Monster. *Be warned that there are major spoilers for this show on the internet, so don’t go looking up too much information beforehand.* read more 
Although Berserk and Monster are totally different when it comes to world setting, but when we look deeper through the anime, Berserk and Monster HAS some simillarities, which is they're both capable to represent the darkest fantasy and reality possible to happen.Maybe Guts and Dr Tenma are quite diffrent personality wise, but when we look at the antagonist on each animes, Johan and Griffith are strikingly simillar. They have a pleasant face for such a evil guy. They also have extreme charisma and extremely manipulative towards any people that they met.Not to mention, Berserk and Monster are heavily talks about moral gray and wickedness of society and government as well.To put it simple, if we kept what makes Berserk is awesome (moral gray, character development, etc) and then we remove all of the dark fantasy and supernatural horror elements in Berserk, we can get Monster. read more "
33,37521,8,"If you like realistic in anime standarts fight scenes but don't really like shounen style fighting scenes -you know, in most of the shounen fights, characters moves so fast and talks so much while fighting and this kills mood- and also like some darkness in the story then good for you o/ you gonna love these two animes.If you liked Vinland Saga, you gonna like Berserk too. Same goes other way around. 
Vinland Saga and Berserk both take place during similar time periods. They both have gritty settings and both stories remain quite psychological. They're both layered shows with good character development that has real depth. 
The action scenes in both anime are very similar although Berserk would be considered a dark fantasy and Vinland Saga is considered Historical Fiction. They have very similar themes with both of the main protagonists being from destitute backgrounds.  
Gritty, action packed, medieval anime about a young, battle hardened main character seeking revenge. 
Both Berserk's Golden Age arc and Vinland primarily deal with medieval warfare, strategy, and politics. Both series have mostly gray character designs, but not for all characters. E.g. Thorkell in Vinland and Adon Coborlwitz in Berserk are stereotypical shounen characters. Vinland's Thorfinn is borderline between angry shounen edgelord and seinen gray, more so then Bererk's Guts. Vinland lacks the romance and supernatural aspects Berserk has, and puts more emphasis on the political dimension instead. The coverage of military action is similar. 
both are very dark and are placed in the middle ages 
Both are very dark and set in medieval times. Both characters driven by revenge.  
Both have strong philosophies about war, success, life and death. Set in medieval era in Europe. Include strong charismatic characters and amazing stories. "
33,777,7,"Both have lots of bloods and guts, as well as some excellent action. Berserk could be summed up as a Medieval Hellsing 
both is very violent and has blood and gore berserk was produced in the 90s so its art work isnt that nice but the story is comparable to those  shonen like naruto.hellsing is a very recent version of the original and its a lot better than original ,so all the hellsing fans should also take a look at berserk,its worth your time 
Both have one of the most badass MC's in anime history, strong female lead(s), great action scenes, lots of blood and gore, rape-filled backstories, superpowered monsters, influences from Christianity, rivalry/betrayal between friends, strategic warfare, well-developed characters, great plot and last but not least: they're both amazing anime. 
One word: BLOODY! Both Hellsing and Berserk are similar in a way. Both of the two protagonists have a similar dark past and grown to become strong as F**K. I mean Alucard is like a devil himself, and Guts was given the name ""hundred man slayer."" Anyway, if you love one of these series, I can guarantee you'll love the other. 
Both have a seemingly unkillable main character indulging in gratuitous violence, and philosophical undertones (which I think Berserk does better).  
Anime that indulge the viewer in extreme amounts of blood and gore with a badass MC that doesn't hold back. A must-watch series. 
Both are set in dark fantasy settings with supernatural horror. Rather cynical in nature, human life is worth little, people often die and the protagonists often blur the line between a cruel anti-hero and an outright villain protagonist. Also, excluding some creatures (e.g elves in Berserk), monsters are mostly either humans or of former human origin. "
33,820,6,"Granted, there are huge differences in setting and presentation, but both center around one man's quest for ultimate power and the many sacrifices that come with this struggle. Political intrigue, war strategy and tactics, along with individual prowess on the battlefield dominate the storyline. 
Both are highly regarded timeless classics. Military warfare and political intrigue is profound here. 
- Reinhard and Griffith are quite similar in their goals and methods, even in appearance;- Both anime are stories of intrigues and politics;- Both are cruel and imply main characters' death;- There are many similar characters in both stories. The difference is in fact that Berserk is a fantasy story, Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu - science fiction. 
These are brilliant anime from the 1990s with a heavy focus on politics, war and drama. The character designs in both are a lot more realistic than the typical anime character designs. The characters of Griffith and Reinhard are also pretty damn similar in terms of their goals and personalities. 
- Both are classic anime- Both are about war and politics- Both are stories about dual protagonists- One of the protagonists in both series are genius tactician which are similar in terms of appearances, personalities and goals  
Just like the other said, Griffith and Reinhard have similar goals and characters. Guts and Yang Wen-Li were also led into a military against their will and became successful commanders.  "
33,338,5,"Both are reasonably serious shows with a focus on political intrigue, back-stabbing nobles and how cruel people can be. But Berserk is set in a fantasy universe with demons and monsters, with a lot of battles, whilst RoV is a historical anime that takes place in France, documenting the beginnings of the French Revolution.Also, Griffith looks awfully similar to Lady Oscar (all that long, fluffy hair...) 
While Berserk is a fantasy anime and Rose of Versailles is more focused on romance, both have to do with political intrigue, nobility's schemes, betrayals and kingdoms in crisis. Miura, the author of Berserk has stated that Rose of Versailles has been one of the many inspirations behind his writing. 
While Berserk is much bloodier than Rose of Versailles, both series are about a nation in conflict (the nation in Berserk is in war, the nation in Rose of Versailles is on the verge of war). Both put focus on the backstabbing that happens within the nobility on a regular basis (this plays center stage in Rose of Versailles and takes a very important back seat in Berserk). Neither series shy away from showing the harsh truths of life. Berserk has the ""rich people are awful"" perspective shown from soldiers, with Rose of Versailles has the ""rich people are awful"" perspective shown through rich people. If I'm not mistaken, Kentaro Miura cited Rose of Versailles as influence on the political aspect of Berserk.If you're looking for a good drama about crisis, look into these two series. read more 
Both are war stories with characters who you get to see grow througout their lives. Berserk is obviously more fantastical, but both focus on the human element of war, and let you see the gruesomness that happens from all perspectives. 
From what I've read about Berserk's creator, Kentaro Miura, Berserk is essentially the world's best and most popular piece of Ladyhawk/Rose of Versailles/Fist of the North Star crossover fanfiction, with bits of Devilman thrown in. The golden age arc, which the original Berserk series adapts, borrows heavily from the motifs and character archetypes of Versailles no Bara, and even as a casual viewer, I can see the parallels, particularly if one has also seen the relatively obscure film Ladyhawk, of which Miura is a professed fan.Essentially, if you liked the golden age arc of Berserk, you'll probably like Versailles no Bara, and vice versa. Berserk is bloodier, and features slightly less in the way of shojo tropes, owing to its fusion of shonen elements into its manga 'DNA', but they're very similar in most ways that I feel matter. read more "
33,44,3,"Like Kenshin, it is a psychologically realistic exploration the motivations effects of the killing life on one's mind and state of being, albeit in a very different ways. Likewise the drive and effect of ideology are explored but instead of the deadening of the heart and soul as we find in Kenshin, in Beserk it is the corrupting effects of power and ambition.Both have compelling narratives, and while Beserk may not have the lavish animation we find in Kenshin, it is still an immersing and engrossing watch.And both have compelling narratives albeit in highly different settings. 
The two works depict a particularly worked main character living in a world without mercy that has taken away his childhood.With violence as the only defense against a tragic and inevitable destiny, these two heroes will each meet a woman they will try to protect from all their beings.I'm talking about two of the biggest tragedies of Japanese animation. Brutal, beautiful, upsetting. 
Both are concentrated adaptations of a flashback sequence in their respective parent mangas (for Berserk it is an adaptation of the Golden Age arc while for Rurouni Kenshin this OVA adapts the Remembrance sequence in the Jinchu arc). Both series leave stuff out from the manga but also add stuff in, giving each piece a more stand alone feel. In my opinion, the story and characters of both series are incredibly well developed. Guts and Kenshin are somewhat comparable, both are youths who are very good at swordsmanship and join a certain group of warriors. Romance plays a role in both series and they end in a similar emotional manner (events between them vary WILDLY). Both build up to their finales with foreshadowing, and they deal with heavy themes too. To me at least, Berserk and Tsuikou-hen give off a very oppressive and dark vibe, and comedy is sparse and becomes non-existent by the end. Berserk and Tsuikou-hen have quite brutal actions scenes that honestly unsettled me at times.Berserk is much longer than Tsuikou-hen, the former is a full 25 episode series while the latter is a 4 part OVA that can be edited into a 2-hour movie. Berserk is a dark fantasy set in a fictional universe while Tsuikou-hen is historical fiction set during the Bakumatsu.  read more "
33,45,2,"Charismatic main character, a lot of battles and deep lore. 
If you enjoy sword fights and a tragic hero then Kenshin and Berserk are for you. They both have a manslayer as a protagonist and are full of action-packed battles. While one shows the reformed side of a sword fighter and the other the manslayer side, they both have two deep characters that will make your heart ache for them. Each series' lead character, Gatsu and Kenshin, know only one thing in life: the sword. Each of them relies on this knowledge, for better or worse, to live their lives and to help the ones they love. "
33,10087,2,"Both are action based and follow characters with a history and specific goal in mind that they wish to achieve. Both have quite heavy themes. 
Both are tragic dark fantasy stories filled with violence and betrayal but also friendship. Both have men willing to do anything to reach their goal, men learning more about themselves and even a tragic romance. And both are pretty damn good. "
33,1575,2,"Ok guys are the story lines similar? Kinda, a big army vs a little army. Are the settings the same? No, one is medieval and the other is futuristic. But what realy makes these series similar are the characters. Griffith=Lelouch because they are the tactitian  and guts=Suzaku because they are the soldier. Both have similar plots of trust issues, romantic tension, glorified battle scenes, and commanders trying to get revenge and rule the world.  If code geass fans pick up berserk skip the first episode, watch it last. and berserk fans try to stay with the main characters and dont pay attention to the school students. read more 
Both main characters battle with their inner demons. "
33,11061,2,"HxH too like Berserk is another good story with development, drama, relationships, tactics, twists, and gore. HxH is shounen but gets gory at Chimera Ant which Berserk has common with-monsters. 
The friendship between Gon and Killua from HxH is somewhat reminiscent of the friendship between Guts and Griffith from Berserk. Both Griffith and Gon have goals which they deeply wish to fulfill while Guts and Killua simply strive to help their friend achieve said goal while not having ambitions of their own. Helping their friends give them a sense of purpose. The two shows also feature incredibly memorable side characters and fleshed out settings.  "
32182,30276,122,"Both series have the same sense of humor and absurd, comedic art packed with high amount of action in each episode, portraying how strong the protagonist is compared to the rest of the characters. 
Both series by the same creator ""ONE"" and both adapted from his iconic web comics.Unsurprisingly art style, character designs and sense of humour are almost identical.Both shows have great OST's and animation. 
Both of these stories are written by ONE, and have the same sense of humor. They started out as webcomics, although you'll notice that the style is different, as OPM got picked up by a bigger company, and got a new artist, although the story is still written by ONE.There are several theories that the worlds are actually connected.Mob and Saitama have very similar personalities, that are along the lines of emotionless, although they both have different reasons for such.Both build up their allies, and occasionally, foe turns into friend.  
Both made from the same creator. Both are action packed with fantastic fight scenes. Both contain humor that will make you LOL. If you watched one of these and you enjoyed it I would defo recommend watching the other.  
One Punch Man and Mob Psycho 100 have a really similar feeling, that being said the both share the same creator. They both contain a ridiculously overpowered main character who has two emotions, ""OK"" and ""K.O""! They even share a similar art-style. I really enjoyed them both~! ღ(❤♡❤ღ) Super Powers FTW!!! 
Same creator, same style of comedy, both have similar nice art and a have a very op main character that doesn't seem to care about it. If you like one of these shows, you will most likely like the other. 
Both of these series are really unique on their own but share a similar humor and main character. The biggest difference is probaly the art Style. One Punch Man used the redrawings from another mangaka while in Mob Psycho 100, Bones went all out and used ONE's original drawings. Which gives off a great vibeI can assure you that if you liked either series the other is going to be a fun ride all over again. 
Both are by the same author. Both are good. 
This is literally the same exact show - same type of comedy, very similar art style, even the main character is identical in looks and power.It's One Punch with Ghosts - If you like one, you'll like the other. 
Both original mangas are made by the same Author : ONE.As having the same author, the art style is the same.Those two share a lot in common thanks to their main characters, who are totally overpowered, where Saitama is a physical monster whereas Mob is a psychic monter. 
Same creator same overpowered MC.Thats all you need to know 
When I saw the first episode of this show, there was only one thing going through my mind: One Punch Man. Why? Simple, the main character of Mob Psycho 100, Kageyama, is like a mini Saitama from One Punch Man. Here's some things the two main characters have in common:- They are always bored- They are overpowered- They are both very calm most of the time- Their faces... I'm serious.- They have a sidekick... Completely useless... But they are still sidekicks... Right?The characters are always fighting monsters in an original and funny way, which is something they have also have in common. 
From the same author, One punch man and Mob Psycho 100 both are comedy anime with a similiar art style and way of making jokes. Both are about characters with superpowers. While the story in one punch man is almost non-existent, the story in mob psycho 100 is the opposite.  
Same author, style and humor 
Comes from the same creator - ONE. With similar tropes of Comedy and action elements blended together with an interesting character set, for both shows equally. 
Same creator, different art style but works quite well, similar comedy, really strong main character, has some very crazy twists that you should expect from One but you won't actually expect, and overall is amazing.  
Both series star overpowered MCsBoth series share similar, incredible visual style and animationBoth shows have similar humorBoth shows have a similar paceBoth shows are based off of the creations of one author, ONE, and it really shows 
Made by the same web manga creator ONE. The style is simular (all be it mob psycho being more flashy). however the witty humour and amazing fight scenes are in both anime. 
Same author , main character in both series have similar personality ,in both series characters have super natural abilities    
Similar fashion in terms of character styling, attitude, as well as both have overpowered main character. Similar comedy and joke. No wonder since it is from the same author. A bit different in term of environments art since Mob designed to be a bit more sketchy compared to OPM.  
Made by the same author, both Mob Psycho 100 and One Punch Man share a lot of similarities with each other. The protagonists are very powerful but are lacking in other aspects. Both the shows follow their main characters, as they learn that being all-powerful doesn't solve everything. If you enjoy great fights and good character development in anime, you'll probably enjoy both the shows. 
Yes others said it all, let me tell again. These anime have- similar vibe with similar main protagonists- the main character never brags about his strenth- his strength his limits and source of his strength are not known- finally the art of both is literally the same 
It's the same actor, so that means, same humorous style. The protagonists have almost a equally mindset of what they doing. Both have good animation, therefore it has good dose of action. Interesting support characters. That's it.You'll not regret. 
They are made by the same mangaka, One!Most facial expression in Mob Psycho 100 are based out of Saitama's ""Ok"" face. Both anime contain a similar story starting from the main character  already having a monstrous strength. Action are undoubtedly awesome and characters have various personality even though their face are... Similar.Personally a really amazing anime that are shadowed by the greatness of OPM. A must watch for those who want more of OPM after watching all the OVAs. 
They were both created by the same person and both have a main character that has trouble having emotions and is put in weird scenarios yet One Punch Man is more comedic focused. 
Both feature an unassuming main character, who is overpowered. The side characters can be very dramatic, which plays of the main characters very calm, bored demeanor. The art style is very similar, and so is the humor.  
Similar humor, similar protagonist and idea. 
Well, the biggest similarity is the main character, both have a really similar design, face: a poker face. Both have one of the best animations ever produced. Both have a lot of action, WITH eye-pleasing visuals. The humor is insanely similar. 
Both protagonists are very strong but they pretend to act like common people  
Same author, both main characters have similar personality and both have overwhelming power 
Both are written by ONE, both are comical and very enjoyable.  If you liked OPM, you will most probably like Mob Psycho 100, vice versa 
Same overpowered main characters and very good comedy. 
It looks like a strong character with a straight face, destroying all enemies in its path 
They are both quality action anime but OPM has much more comedy and Mob psycho more storyline action 
-- They are both by the same author-- Both have characters who cant control their powers-- Both also have side characters who try to be as powerful as them 
Saitama and Mob look and behave similarly. They both have a ""sidekick"" character who aren't as powerful (although, Genos can definitely beat up Reigen--and almost anybody-- anytime). They are both very powerful characters from the beginning, exaggeratedly so. Both animes have incredible action--and the animation styles for it--and are mostly funny.I'm not caught up with Mob Psycho just yet, but I'm not the only one who has seen the similarities between these two. 
Mob Psycho 100 and One Punch Man were written by the same man, a web comic artist called ONE. So both of these shows share a similar theme of humor and integrate it into bombastic, over the top action scenes. ONE's talent to emotionally connect the audience to his larger-than-life characters in a smooth, natural way is also used to its fullest in Mob Psycho 100. Each show is gorgeously animated and is backed by an appropriately great OST. 
They are basically the same but with them being the opposite such as saitama has basically endless physical strength when on mob psyscho 100. Mob has pretty much no physical strength but has esper powers. (And not to mention its literally written by the same writer the wrote one punch man) 
Mob Psycho and One punch man both have a protagonist with near god like powers who just want to be acknowledged by their peers.  
- From the same Author- Overpowered Main Character- Reverse Mentor & Apprentice Situation 
same style and humor  
Mob in Mob Psycho 100 and Saitama in One Punch man  not only look almost identical, but they behave, react and talk in almost the same way. 
V similar art style and humour 
They have the same author, and the protagonists are pretty similar - average looking with unbelievably strong powers, who yet are somehow too dense to realize the great potential that they hold.I didn't like both of them, but if you liked either one of them, you're sure to like the other. 
They are made by the same creator and have the same animation style, with Mob Psycho staying truer to the web comic it derived from. Mob is more relatable to me than Saitama. The shows are both amazing. 
The MCs have same characteristics and appearances. They are also overpowered and no one can beat them. 
I don't know why but these two anime's just really connect with each other with the main character  
One Punch Man and Mob Psycho 100 both feature an overpowered main character alongside powerful and interesting friends that take on formidable villains with epic fight scenes 
Mob Psycho 100 is the obvious progression for anyone who was a fan of One Punch Man. Given they are both products of the writer One they carry many of the same tropes, namely the dead-pan, obscenely powerful protagonist. However, I believe that Mob Psycho 100 brings more emotion to the table than OPM. There are emotional moments in OPM, but Mob Psycho 100 really takes it home because where Saitama lacks ambition and is only a hero as a hobby, Mob has ambition, just ludicrously misplaced. In this way Mob seems to me to be a more relatable  and in-depth character than Saitama. The supporting cast of MP1 is also a big step up. I love Genos just as much as anyone else, but he can be a bit... robotic. MP1 basically takes the premise and style of OPM, and improves on it in a way that makes an even more engaging and interesting story.  If you liked One Punch Man, you will love Mob Psycho 100. read more 
Aside from the fact that both stories were created by the same manga artist, ONE, there are lots of similarities that mean if you like one show, you'll probably like the other. Super powerful main character? Check. Ridiculous humor? Check. Well thought out side characters and meaningful relationships? Check and check. They're both wonderful. But, saying all that, they ARE completely separate stories that are amazing on their own, not just copies of the other.  
Both series show strong protagonists who deal with their powers, many fights, with fluid animation and the same style of art. From the same creators! 
Both main characters are overpowered, the original manga is by the same author. Really good fight scenes and comedy. 
Similar styles of humor mixed with intense action scenes 
Both series have the same author, and are finger lickin' gud 
Same sense of humor and same absurd fights you should totally watch it. 
Same refreshing take on the overpowered protagonist trope. Each has their own way of handling it that makes them completely unique in their own respect. 
I understand that this is an obvious one, however, most people overlook Mob psycho. these anime are similar that both MC are overpowered and create some of the best fight scenes ever, the animation is always on point, where they differ is that when one punch man second season aired it lowered in quality immensely whoever mobs second season improved not only in the story but in animation too, Mob also has far greater character development. 
overpowed MCfull comedyaction packedsuperpowersliterally almost everything of Mob Psycho100 reminds me of OPM 
Same author, OverPowered main character and in my opinion pretty similar comedy plus Mob’s is dope  
Both are really strong. Mob for being an esper and Saitama for being a hero. But they have their own unique plots that you will never get tired of. :) 
Created by same author, ONE. Overpowered MCs who can defeat enemies without a sweat. Funny and action-packed anime. 
Both main characters are OP but lack emotions and are underestimated because of their appearance. 
First of all it is the same author that wrote both animes. Second, both MC's have great powers and their personality seem similar. I get the same vibe (humor) from both of these animes when I watch them.  
They have got the same mangaka and have got similarities like:-Both protagonists are so OP-They have got uniqe styles -Mob is like Saitama but he is psychic 
In Mob Psycho there are people called espers who are basically same as heroes in one punch man. Main character from Mob has almost same personality as Saitama and is one of (if not) the most powerfull espers. Very similar animation with amazing fight scenes and coreography.  
-it almost have the same graphics as one punch man-Mob Psycho 100 is popular with its strong esper, while one punch man is popular  with its powerful physical hero  
-Both series written by the same author-One is about an overpowered hero and another is about an overpowered psychic-The fight scenes of both series are epic-Both series have an amazing protagonist were an antagonist has chance of winning against. Both MC's have a unique personality according to the perspective of the seriesIf you like this one you will like the other one also 
Just look at the art style. They're both comedies about people with super powers.. And both of them are great. 
they have the same author so the tone and humor are similar and they both have overpowered main protagonists 
Both series were created by the same author, and they both feature amazingly animated action, and lots of comedic moments.If you like lighthearted shows, with some more serious undertones, you ll certainly enjoy these shows. 
-Written by the same author-Amazingly written op mc-Husbando material -Funny but action packed 
Saitama is overpowered, Mob(MC in MP100) is overpowered. Both are unbeatable in the anime. They're strong as hell and they look the same, but Mob has a hair an Saitama's Bald. 
Both are anime adaptations of manga that were made by the same author.Both have similar styles of storytelling, comedic tone, and vibe. 
Both were originally created by the same guy, so both share the same art style and have a similar style of humor. If you like one, you'll most likely enjoy the other as well. 
The main characters have the exact same facial features and are both extremely powerful. The creatorof One punch man and Mob Pyscho 100 are also the same and  
The heroes are pretty cool and charismatic (although differents) and the enemies (like monsters) are very originals and sometimes creepy O_o . That's the main reasons why I recommend this two animes. 
They both have the same creator, ONE, and each has overpowered main characters and humorous side characters.  
Overpowered, but very relatable main characters that are very fun to watch. The stories are great, coming from the same author, but were they really stand out is in their execution. Both are filled with sakuga and some of the best animation anime has to offer, with a varied staff that really seems to have put passion into each work. 
Similar kind of humor. Both have strong/OP main character with personal issues. 
Produced by the same author both of these aim to explore the mentality of an overpowered character, both have great humour, characters, and animation 
Quite a similar premise and both come with great animation 
Never too serious, always have a good humor that surrounds for every character. Battle scenes, animation, sounds and the story is great. I recommend this anime for those who want to laugh and see some amazing fight scenes. 
Same writer, same general style of humour meeting over-the-top action! Highly recommended! 
Similar type of humor and OP mainThey are both from the same author 
One Punch Man and Mob Psycho 100 were both made by the same person, One, with very similar purposes and ideas. OPM and MP100 are both great but personally I think Mob Psycho is better than OPM. Defiantly should check Mob Psycho out if you like One Punch Man and have not seen Mob.  
The heroes of both shows are insanely powerful and are subject to intense, exciting fight sequences. With overwhelming strength, they must find value in the mundane life and figure out how to grow as people. One Punch Man deals with superpowers akin to comic book heroes/villains while Mob Psycho 100 deals with unique psychic abilities. 
Same creator, OP characters but it has more indepth exploration of morals and such 
Both of them are carrying  about same premise especially an overpowered main character. Also, they have a poker face which makes me laugh all the time. The fighting scene is nice tho. Very recommended 
the two have great jokes, are very excited, have a plot that is even consistent, and that they are from the same creator. 
If you like the over-the-top-comedy with crudely drawn art styles to achieve this level of comedy along with an OP main character and you have already seen one of these. You’ll almost definitely enjoy the other due to the similar vibes they give off. 
  The author of these two animes is the same: ONE.   Even though saitama and mob are so strong, they still look for something that they still lack, like feelings or even a fair fight. 
Both Mob psycho 100 and One punch Man has been made by ONE. Both of this anime is totally similar. ""ONE"" (the creator) learned his mistakes from making OPM (one punch man) and refilled those hole into Mob psycho. So, we can tell Mob psycho is the refined version of One punch man. The MC of OPM and Mob psycho 100 is Over Powered in there world. They are like emotionless. Saitama is too much powerful and he has like infinite strength which made him not only in anime but also the strongest fictional character in history. There were some lackness in OPM. Saitama being emotionless, OP, less credit taking somehow pissed some of us guys.But Mob psycho is totally good. Everyone knows about Mob's power. Mob is freaking powerful but not infinite level strength. He also has romantic feelings.In overall, I prefer mob psycho though both of this anime is good. Try it out! read more 
Both series are made by the same creator with similar nonchalant overpowered main character with an internal day to day struggle based on the usefulness and enjoyment of their own abilities. Both protagonist are lackluster in their own way while they are great and supported by great side characters. Comedic,action,satirical they contain similar traits that will surely entertain you. 
They both have very powerful main characters. They also both have a variety of powers. 
1. Both anime are by the same author.2. Both anime have an overpowered main character.3. Both anime have great funny humor.4. Both anime have clean animation.5. Both anime have loveable side characters. 
They are both made by the same guy and Mob Psycho is better and has better animation while one punch man is good by overrated and overhyped. 
Both anime has overpowered characters, one with strength and one with psychic powers. For anime starters or newbies Mob Psycho and One Punch Man highly recommend because both of them are enjoyable show, entertaining and really great to begin with.  
Both have similar overpowered MC with similar designs and psychological porblems. Second MCs usually get all the praise, even though they are not as powerful as MC. 
It is written by the same creator ONE so if people enjoyed OPM, then they can also enjoy MP100 due to the similar humor. 
i mean it's made by the same dude so it's bound to be similar. but seriously, Mob Psycho is a really great show and I highly recommend it. 
If you liked one of these shows, you will love the other. There are many OPM references in Mob Psycho 100 as well. Both shows are very unique and entertaining to watch. Highly recommend these two shows to any anime fan. 
The main characters have supreme powers but their view of life is simple. 
-a BEAUTIFUL animation-a absurd sense of humour-really great characters and MC 
Both series are originally created by the director One in the Web Manga. Their art style is just phenomenal, you can feel the characters are constantly moving even during the fight scenes. The main characters are almost identical with similar design, similar behavior and they are both very powerful. Also both series are extremely funny and they have interesting twists. 
Both have main protagonists that are extremely overpowered plus some really good action, also have similar if not the same artstyle  
--> Both of the Anime's Have Same Mangaka--> Both Saitama and Kageyama Shigeo are Over-Powered--> Both of these anime's have some similar content in between.--> Both of them have a lot of comedy and humour.  
SIMILARITIES:- OPM and MP100, both were written by the same Mangaka. - Both of them have an overpowered MC.- Both of them have comedy and action. DISIMILARITIES:- MP100 has a school set-up, whereas in OPM, it's a kind of Hero Association set-up. - OPM does not have villains who creates a great impact on the MC. All the villains are easily eliminated by the MC. 
To everyone who loved the action packed and beautifully animated first series of One Punch Man, you should give Mob Psycho 100 a try. Both share the same creator and an overpowered main character, although Mob Psycho goes deeper on the emotional development of the characters in it. I give both a 9/10. 
Same creators. MC's have pretty much the same personality. Similar art style. Both probably just as funny. Both MC's have a lot of power too. 
I'm just gonna say 'One' (pun indeed) thing about my experience with these two:""Don't Judge a book by its cover."" If you like seeing Overpowered protagonists fighting evil in a comical way, you'll definitely love these 2 shows.  
It was made by the same creator and has a similar synopsis with an overpowered character who suffers from mental issues this anime is equally as funny with a great main character and awesome side characters. 
They are by the same creators and according to the manga take place in the same universe so they are supper similar. 
Same author, similar humor, and overpowered main character. 
Made by the same team as OPM, great funny show with interesting characters and deep undertones. And another seriously OP MC, we all love it. 
Same author and brilliant animation 
Both anime are made by the same author.Both anime have the same funny humor.Both anime have breathtaking animation. 
Both involve an OP MC and are both entertaining asf. Mob psycho is a bit deeper than one punch man but one punch man is more entertaining. Two must watch’s. 
They have the same humor, art style, and epic fight scenes.  
Same author, same concept. POWERFUL BUT LONELY MALE PROTAGONIST  
Both of these stories are written by ONE, and have the same sense of humor. They started out as webcomics, although you'll notice that the style is different, as OPM got picked up by a bigger company, and got a new artist, although the story is still written by ONE.There are several theories that the worlds are actually connected.Mob and Saitama have very similar personalities, that are along the lines of emotionless, although they both have different reasons for such.Both build up their allies, and occasionally, foe turns into friend 
Both of these are great anime created by One. They have similar art style, humor and they both follow an OP main character. 
Saitama and Reigen are somewhat alike. They're both adults just tryna live life, but Saitama gets caught up in hero society bullshit meanwhile Reigen gets caught up in spirits and such. "
32182,22135,5,"- Similar fluid and exaggerated art-style- Energtic OST- Bowl-cut protagonist 
both main protagonists have a strong power and ignore it both have uniqe art  
Ping Pong is similar to Mob Psycho because of the fact their artstyles are normally crude and perhaps, ugly, but their respective productions draw out the best of them and as a total work, they are gorgeous and with fluid animation.Apart from these, both works are unique coming-of-age stories (Mob Psycho though shines more in this department at its 2nd season). 
If you like quiet but thoughtful protagonists, an interesting and complex cast of characters, and beautiful fluid animation, these shows are top tier. The subject matter is very different but I think they're surprisingly similar. 
If you've watched Ping Pong and liked it. You'll love Mob psycho 100. Just make sure to give it at least 5 episodes before dropping it because the first 3 episodes are gonna be a bit boring. Mob Psycho also has that unique and experimental art-style like Ping Pong, and it has many more bla bla similarities to Ping Pong. And I promise it won't feel like a ditto. I had it as my No. 1 favorite for like a whole year and thought that nothing can come close to how much I like this but Ping Pong gave me the same feeling of when I watched Mob Psycho100. read more "

32182,245,4,"Reigen Arataka and Onizuka are highly similar in character: People who at first glance, would seem like swindlers or frauds. More than that, what makes them similar is, they genuinely care for their sidekicks/students and are ready to protect them from any harm that they may encounter. Imo, both Reigen's design, as well as character, is heavily inspired by Onizuka. Both also possess that subtle charisma and self-confidence that makes viewers like them. 
Onizuka and Reigen are basically the same people except Onizuka is cooler lol but both are as hilarious and dopey as one another and are senseis 
-Both has main characters who are damn funny Onizuka and Reigen, Aratakaand both shows consist of comedy and have someone who wants to protect others. 
Combine Reigen Arataka's cunning and character design with Mob's ""saving the day,"" and you get Eikichi Onizuka. GTO also has a similar master-apprentice vibe. I recommend watching it.  "
32182,11061,4,"no one make a recommendation to HxH? okay, the similariity between these 2 animes is in the way they tend to over-expaining something narratively though MPS's was more humorous and yet it's rare to see any anime that put narration dominant in a  episode. 
The characters and setting, while very different, feels similar in the lighthearted sense. 
I love hxh and while i watched Mob reminded me the meaning of friendship, and also the battles and the uniqueness on every esper, was nice :) (especial season 2)

10165,11843,57,"Both are slice-of-life anime dealing with the everyday high school lives of boys/girls. Both can be rather hit or miss in the comedy department, though Nichijou tends to takes its jokes to whole new extremes. 
Slife-of-life series that set themselves apart from the rest with their ridiculous humour and random high-tension moments. They call themselves 'everyday' series, and sure enough, even their absolute weirdest moments can be strangely relatable. 
Despite the fact that Nichijou focuses on the daily lives of high school girls, and Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou focuses on the daily lives of high school boys, there are three elements that shine very brightly and show a certain correlation in both series. The first is the underlying concept: these shows tackle some of the common aspects of being a high school girl or boy, respective to the title, as well as some of the stranger aspects of it. Second is the execution of this idea. Both are comedies, and, therefore, exaggerate certain scenarios, but both do so in a similar manner, and typically through the eyes of a growing set of cast members, while still remaining  primarily focused on three main characters (well, I suppose you could say five or six, in Nichijou’s case). The responses to these absurd scenarios are typically outrageous, but always unique to the individual character who experiences or responds to it. Thirdly, the art style of both are different from each other, but, at the same time, very distinct and set apart from the art from other titles, and the music is very unique and catchy.Both of these anime are set apart from other comedy-based anime due to their unique execution and strangely engaging, yet distant cast. If one of the two manages to capture your attention, the other is likely to do the same. read more 
Daily life of high school students with a lot of comedy, and both is so RANDOM! 
Both series' episodes contain a few sketches which rarely correspond to other and they have similar humor style. 
Both  are school comedies with the same type of random humor. One is just mainly about girls, and the other one is mainly about boys. 
The female version of Danshi No Nichijou is ""Nichijou"" itself. While the comedy of the male version is a bit funky and teen-oriented, Nichijou offers a comedy that fits all the ages. Yet, the comedy seen in both of anime is actually enjoyable to anyone who wants to break free from boredom. 
Even the title is similar. DKNN presents the daily life of high school boys. Nichijou does the same, but with girls. Both series are very funny, have the same sense of humor and hilarious/wierd characters. Yukko is a little bit similar to Tadakuni IMO. And Mio reminds me of Hidenori and Yoshitake. I think that every Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou fan should try Nichijou. It's worth it. 
Very similar comedy styles. Both set in a ""normal"" slice-of-life school setting, with random cutscenes of hilariousness. The only difference is Nichijou treats truly impossible events (robots, cats talking, etc.) as completely average. Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou focuses more on regular high school boys.  
A series of comedic sketches from everyday life of a group of high-schoolers without any big plot. 
A story about their everyday life, the random things they do. They are really similar to each other only except that Nichijou has female main characters. 
Both series adapt a slice of life approach with exaggerated scenes of humor, comedy, and absurd dialogues. In fact, some of the moments in both series are so random that it almost makes little to no sense.Both series take place at a high school life setting where there is drama involving the main characters. Both series also feature main cute scenes and just in general, nonsense revolving around the characters' lives. 
A group of three school friends with varied personalities involve others in their weird, but entertaining lives.  
Well, the name says almost everything, is about the daily lives of the characters. Both anime have random sense comedy so, for those who like comedy, this is it. 
Those two animes are so similar, it's about school-comedy life, where all the characters face funny situations that leaves them in a weird position, and many supernatural accidents happen in both of these anime series. 
Both are very funny except for nichijou,the comedy began o shallow but fun to watch 
If you liked Nichijou, then you'll love Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou. The two share a style of doing skits and random humor. The characters are quite enjoyable and the skits are unique. Although Nichijou is a bit more clean when it comes to the humor. Both still have got me laughing until I cried. 
You will smile with this anime a lot. The jokes are very good and it's very original. I love this anime too, I smiled and enjoyed a lot with this anime. For me, is the best anime of comedy. I really recommend it. 
Danshi and nichijou are both slice of life/comedy/randomness anime. They are really funny and interesting, but i think danshi is a bit funnier than nichijou. These shows don't have a story, so don't watch them if you expect story, these are just a bunch of random and hilarious jokes. While in danshi mc are male, in nichijou mc are female. 
Both of them are Slice of Life series about highschool girls and boys. They've got similar humour and jokes as well as funny characters. I guarantee you that you won't stop laughing when watching both of them. 
Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou = ""Daily Lives of High School Boys"". Nichijou = ""My Ordinary Life""; See the resemblances already? Both anime take place primarily in a high school setting with a colorful, dank cast of characters with dank humor. Skits are taken to a whole new level of extremes and even the most ordinary of situations become something extraordinary.  
Both are aboout funny everyday situations gone awkward and hilarious 
Both shows take place in high school and the episodes are made in the same way with different skits. They both mainly follow three friends but have a lot of side characters as well. If you liked the comedy of one then you'll surely like the other. 
both of them have a mild comedy-life story, but sometimes excessivethey also have a little weird characterthis anime are comfortable to watch when you've spare time 
Nichijou was about similar to Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou.. In Nichijou, the story goes with female casts and some male supporting.. But in Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou, it was backward.. The story was casted by male actors and some female actors supporting the story.. Funny and laugh was the similarity of these anime series.. 
If you watched Nichijou I highly recommend to watch this too. Well if you already watched and loved Nichijou watching another ""Everyday life"" anime wouldn't hurt. The Comedy is on equal or IMO slightly better than Nichijou's. Also you don't need to remember the character's names to have fun (as stated in the anime) :D 
Both are stories of ""daily life of some students"", but more comical and exaggerated form, and also use mini-histories. The protagonists are the same gender in majority. 
Both series follow a school of weirdos doing silly things in very short skits. 
these are both slice of life comedies. Both are very funny and deliver the comedy in a similar fashion 
Both have exactly the same format of endless comedic skits. As such there is no overall story but some skits do link together over time.Each has a wide cast of characters that appear during scenes.Both are much funnier than the average comedy.Nichijou focuses on the lives of 3 highschool girls while Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou focuses on the lives of 3 highschool boys. 
It Nichijou male version 
Both are hilarious, random, super funny and both shows are about teens and they daily lives C: 
Nichijou depicts the daily lives of three high school girls. But in Danishi Koukousei no Nichijou it's rather the opposite. 3 highschool boys will be living their daily lives. Both shows doesn't have a main story rather tells seperate story. 
-Both anime tell about everyday life (especially students) with many hillarious comedy.-Both anime's episode consist of some parts that actually unrelated with each other. 
Pretty much both of them are Comedy/Slice of life anime with lots of random jokes implemented in them. They also dont have a specific plot in which the story follows. However, Nichijou may have extreme events such as a talking cat, your school director fighting with a deer and even ""destroying planets with laser beams "" while DKNN shows the life of Highschool boys and their ""boring"" lives.Nichijou shows all the characters and their traits while DKNN mostly shows ""boys"" acting like ""boys"".If you are a fan of Slice of life/Comedy anime, you should definitely try them out! 
If you liked the high school comedy aspect of Nichijou then you might like this, though one thing to note is that is anime is more of a crude type of comedy in contrast to the pure-hearted comedy and slice of life aspect of Nichijou. 
Similar sketch comedy. 
Nichijou but it's boys instead of girls 
Instead of funny show with female main cast in highschool you have a funny show with male main cast in highschool. :D 
Both are focused in life of students. The comedy ae alike and the art style are almost similar to each other 
Similar ComedySchool SettingHilarious 
Pretty much the same but with girls instead of boys. Both hilarious! 
Hilarious, disjointed and sometimes nonsensical, both shows are a carefree laughing spree in the context of everyday life. 
They both are slice-of-life high school gag anime with a tremendous amount of humor. They are more or less the same thing except the MCs are guys in Danshi and girls in Nichijou. Both devotes a fair amout of screen time to side characters and subgroups. 
Both are very bizarre in their way of comedy, although Nichijou excels in it, Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou is not far behind. Both are very enjoyable, and if you loved Nichijou, you will love Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou too. 
both had slice of life , highschool background , had a great comedy but nichijou was more extreme... 
Similar short funny moments compiled on one episode. Both are one of the best comedy ever existed in anime industry 
Both shows focus on daily lives of students, with both following similar episodic formats. They also both have a very chaotic style of humour  
Silliness and over-the-top humor. If you're looking for a good laugh, both of these series could satisfy you. 
A group of three friends go about their normal school lives, in an episodic, hilarious take on teenage years.  
Very similar in comedic style, with pretty much the same sketch format that makes both shows unique. Highly rewatchable, too. 
Same concept of mundane daily highschool life made funny by witty humor. Very similar to Nichijou in setting/characters (both have 3 highschool friends, except Nichijou is of course girls and Danshi Koukoussi no Nichijou is the exact opposite.)Although, DKnN isn’t as over the top at Nichijou by any means. 
Comedies with high school studens. Both contains short sketches. 
Slice of life comedies divided in segments, each focusing on a different group of mostly high school students. The humor often feels similar, with a lot of absurd jokes combined with exaggerated faces and reactions. 
Totally recommended, just like you and everyone, we went through High school and spent our time and happiness by the amazing people we met. 
-Both will make you laugh a lot.... Almost guaranteed xD-Both have their fair share of goofy and hilarious characters-Must-watch titles for comedy lovers :D 
These two have exactly the same kind of humor and episode structure (with running gags, recurring characters, etc.). The only difference is that Nichijou is mainly about high school girls, but Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou is abut high school boys. If you enjoyed one of these you will love the other one too. "

437,4282,4,"Both go through dreams and reality. Both confusing as hell. Both Mind F**ks. 
Both movies feature identity/reality crises.  Both have horror/violence elements.  Both are mind trips, forcing you to pause/think/rewatch to fully appreciate.  Where Kara no Kyoukai is more epic/fantastic, Perfect Blue is more human/realistic.  The art in Kara no Kyoukai is more attractive, while the voice acting (japanese) in Perfect Blue is more powerful.  Both movies have top-knotch plot and presentation:  go watch. 
Both are psychological thrillers featuring a female lead and a high amount of violence and gore. They are very dark and mature and will leave the viewer confused as to what is actually happening as the lines between fantasy and reality become increasingly blurred. If you're looking for an anime that blends horror and mystery these two will be sure to please. 
No other film stands in the way of non-linear storytelling other than these two—the fifth Kara no Kyoukai film, the grandest peak of the film series deals with themes of the distortion of reality and dreams, much like the premise of Perfect Blue, as key characters become entwined with the audience's view in a convoluted timeline of events. "
437,43,3,"Ok, so there's not much in common as far as stories go but they do share similar moods and a rather serious style to their respective storytelling. They both also deal with and contemplate the nature of the human psyche. I recommend Perfect Blue mostly because I watched the two almost back to back and while I personally think Perfect Blue is the better film it's quite a bit darker than Ghost in the Shell. I enjoyed them both immensely and I feel you will too. So in summary, both films while lacking in obvious similarities are close in their story telling styles and the underlying exploration of the mind, be it human or the ghost in the machine. I hope you enjoy them both as much as I did. read more 
Both are very dark, grimy and don't shy away from showing violence and naked human flesh.And both have realistic design. 
Both include a female lead who looses their sense of identity and dissociates themselves from their reality.  "
437,30,3,"On the surface these animes are actually nothing alike, but they both have the ability to screw with your mind a great deal. So, my thinking is if you're the type that enjoys a good mind-fcuk... well, Perfect Blue and Eva are probably two animes you should check out =) 
Both of these have psychologically deep stories, reflect dark and uncomfortable realities, and opt for non-traditional ways of presenting their narratives. 
While the plotlines are completely different, the darkness and psychology of both of these anime are on the same league. The use of music in PB also reminded me strongly of NGE.PB, much like Evangelion, has a dystopian, surreal, a bit schizophrenic feel however the most prominent difference is that PB has no lighter aspects as in the the earlier half of NGE.  "
437,19,2,"I'm surprised no one has made this recommendation yet considering the fact that they both somewhat revolve around a serial killer, though in Perfect Blue the MC is being stalked while in Monster the main character is looking for the killer.Both of these can be quite thrilling and can often play with your head thus leaving you mind fucked.If you love psychological thrillers, then either one of these will be right up your alley and they're both well written, whilst Monster is a bit lengthy. 
Both are gripping psychological thrillers with a compelling main character. You get the same sense of gritty reality from Monster that you get from Perfect Blue, they are based in our world and the events that take place seem as though they could actually happen. With well established villains who have understandable motives which is hard to come across now in anime. I feel as though Monster, much like Perfect Blue, is great for people who aren't too big a fan of action but they still want things relatively fast paced. Also for both their premise dosen't loose its intrigue and for the most part the story keeps you engaged throughout. I thoroughly enjoyed both. read more "

The enemy forces are unknown creatures without a clear origin ,with the traitors everywhere,The environment is isolated from the other world   
My first impression of this anime : 'This feels awfully like Attack on Titan'There are three main protagonists like Eren, Armin and Mikasa. They were surrounded by wall and trying to escape it (Although the wall doesn't play that big role in here like in Attack on Titan does). There's also these human eater creatures. Also I think Eren say something similar about them being trapped inside a wall like cattle. Well, in this case they are literally the cattle.I'd say there are also Death Note feel to it, but I lean more towards Attack on Titan. 
A group of people trapped inside of walls trying to escape from ""monsters "" that are trying to eat them. Both groups do some kind of training, trying to fight/escape the titans/demons. The main three characters of each anime have some similarities as well. 
If you liked the plot about humans not being on the top of the food chain in Attack on Titan then you will definitely like story about kids trying to escape the fate of being eaten in The Promised Neverland 
At first sight these animes may not have to much similarities but the sensations of mistery and intrigue to know what is outside the primary and early location of the plot. 
Both shows feature characters inside an area closed off by a wall/fence, possibly keeping someone/something out. Without spoiling much, they're both dark and are based on the main characters trying to survive their situations. 
Both manga are about humans trying to surrive in a world in which they aren't the dominant predators anymore. 
Both have a scary deep world where there is creatures that are a huge threat for the human race and the main characters are trying to get out of their bubble that they have been locked in to try to kill/stop the creatures that are basically eating humans as their lunch 
Both are dark, mystery horror series with lovable characters, nice ost and awesome animation.  
The setting of both shows is very similar.Both shows start of with three main charakters living in a place encircled by walls seperating them from the outside world.The main charakters both have a very strong sense of freedom and have their own idea of a true peaceful life.They also have a very dark atmosphere and lots of mysteries about the world with some twists here and there.   
Both series made me scream at the end of almost every episode with those unexpected cliffhangers, making me have to dreadfully wait for yet another week to find out what plot twist the producers put in once again. 
In both anime - children heroes live in a cage surrounded by monsters. 
same concept on what's in the outside world . 
Both have mystery, being trapped behind a wall and monsters trying to kill them 
-eating humans-trying to discover the world outside-smart protagonists 
Walls, man-eating monsters, and ways to escape, both of these keep you on the edge of your seat.  
Both animes make you ask alot of questions about the anime, there also leaves alot of cliff hangers too which adds suspense 
Both very dark anime, with great storylines 
Both have creatures that are a huge source of fear for the humans characters as they actively eat people.  
Both anime about humans trying to survive from other creatures😶 
Both based on determination to survive, strategy making and existential themes. Arguably Promised Neverland is more intense about all the three mentioned above but that's subjective since it handles that in a more subtle and often plot driven way. It's attention intensive due to that reason. Comparatively, it has more psychological horror, strategy making, mystery and suspense instead of action but also with less edge of the seat moments. The promised neverland although has similar and very well-written characters, doesn't have as much character variation and if action wasn't AoT's best aspect for you, it can definitely fill the hole AoT leaves.Without comparison, Promised neverland is it's own approach at the same themes seen in AoT and it's very good at it, as do the ratings speak for themselves. It's an anime worth watching on it's own. read more 
In both of the anime, there are 'monsters' that eat human beings.In both of the anime, humans want to get past the wall and know what is and what can be seen beyond it.In both of the anime, tactics and strategies are needed to get past the wall. In short terms, humans are using their brains and not force or magic powers.  
-main characters want to know what's beyond the walls-humans are food -action, horror, gore 
Both shows are very similar in concept. Without going into spoilers, they follow the same structure. Think of The Promised Neverland Season 1 as the equivalent of Attack on Titan Seasons 1-3, as they can both be separated in two parts: before “x discovery” and after “x discovery”. The story-telling and world-building in both shows are great and I’m excited to see how The Promised Neverland will follow Attack on Titan’s footsteps. 
Both anime are dark fantasy, and are set in a world where monstrous creatures feed on humans. Both of them add a horror-mystery element to the shounen genre. Both serve up the mystery and worldbuilding bit by bit, doing so beautifully. And there is a lot of character death, of course. Both have characters that completely change the perspective of the audience from what we initially thought. And also, remember to never underestimate the side characters of these shows! 
deep world building and edge of your seat plot are both in these super popular thrillers that will have your mind searching for unknown answers 
Both anime are mystery anime with a lot of suspense and the characters are stuck in similar circumstances. 
Prey fights back. Also both anime have the question, what’s on the outside? 
Post-apocalypse! World-building! Plot twist! If you like animes that are dark then Attack on Titan and Promised Neverland are the best for you. People trapped inside the walls in attack on Titan and kids trapped in farmhouse. Both are similar in plot wise that it will get you invested throughout the whole show. Both involving mystery you will love it. These shoes are a must watch in case of my opinion. 
They are both good at thriller and people in this anime acts so realistic. 
both of the animes want freedom, both of the animes are also about escaping 
Both anime have a strong mystery element that will make you question the nature of what exactly is lurking outside. What is outside? What is the world like? As a viewer, you really want to find out. This mystery will grip you almost instantly!  
There both inside walls and about to get eaten by 'monsters'.  
Dystopian out of the world,both mc are 3,the rests are cannon fodder 
1.Both anime have similar story as AOT focusses  on Titan on the other hand The promise neverland focusses  on demons who are tried to eat human meat. 
Yakusoku no Neverland is almost similar to Shingeki no Kiyojin because they are inside the walls without knowing what is outside the walls. They want to go outside the wall. And there are man eating Demons/Titans. 
If you enjoy the dark mystery of Attack on Titan I can't recommended The Promised Neverland (Yakusoku no Neverland) enough. "
16498,5114,35,"Revenge, Suffering, Agony and Redemption...Shingeki no Kyojin has a feeling of FMA Brotherhood in which a kid who lived a peaceful life gets thrown into a dark grim life full of tragedy and agony due to losing someone important to them. However, both main characters refused to move on and dedicated their lives for revenge and redemption.If you enjoy a full packed action dramatic plot you'll love both of these series. 
There's a reason they have both become such a hit. Because they were brilliantly epic! If you intend to make your tv show life worthwhile, watch this show next. Strong plot, strong character, strong music. All in one made a show the best. 
The loss of mothers plays a significant roll in shaping the characteristics of the protagonists of these two shows. The main characters are enrolled in some kind of military because of personal reasons and are fighting against supernatural enemies. The setting is an alternative steampunk-ish world with the similar use of tools and weapons. Both are considered shounen anime but tend to look like a seinen because they feature above-average violent situations and epic fights but also deep conversations and some philosophy about the human mentality. The animation is not really that similar but the coloring is, using earthy and dusty color almost always.  
FMA brotherhood is my favorite tv anime, but shingeki kyojin has the potential to top that which i thought was impossible. Both protagonists have an incredibly tragic beginning which opens up into an amazing story that is based off of this tragic event.warning fma brotherhood leans more on the shounen side, while shingeki no kyojin has a lot of gore and a a good amount of ""what the fuck moments"". 見てください！このアニメわすげい楽しいですから見て！ 
- Kids used to live in a peacefull city- The main characters are siblings + childhood friend- The 'trigger' is the death of the mother (and wow, they look similiar and they even have the same Voice Actor)- Even though the father is alive, he seems to be absent in the beginning. Both dads have a similar appearance and they seem to be involved in the 'mystery' (titans/alchemy)- There's a focus on military- Almost the same amount of blood/violence/gore- There are also some strong female characters, without fanservice- Both live in a westernized world 
Well, there's certainly a similar vibe in terms of family loss based on the two main characters of the series. In fact, Eren & Mikasa from SnK/Edward & Alphonse from FMA: Brotherhood lost family members after tragedies. These left emotional scars in themselves and made a strong impact throughout their lives. However, they are able to stay alive and take back what's theirs through determination and instinct.There is a focus of military in both series although for very different reasons. The main characters gets involved directly with the military for their own reasons as well. Throughout the series, their skills increase as they fight for what they believe in. Both series contain plenty of chances for drama, action, and emotional moments. There are occasional comedic moments as well (more so in FMA: Brotherhood). Both series also contains tragic scenes that has left painful memories into the characters of their worlds. read more 
Now plot-wise these two share little similarities other than the fact that each anime's main protagonist is a younger male who loses his mother in the beginning of the story. The reason for my recommendation is the incredible quality these two (mature) anime share. Both have incredible stories, with numerous plot twists. Both are very action-heavy and don't hold back any punches with gore and mature themes. If you enjoy one of these, then I'm certain you will enjoy the other. 
*Also similar to the 2003, but Brotherhood was better*There's a thing that makes the main character different from the rest, a special power of some sort. Their parents play a key role in the plot, and both the daddies are mysterious fellows. The stories themselves are amazing, and also pretty dark and gory. To top it off, the soundtracks for both are phenomenal.  
The main characters are both thrust into the epic battles after losing their mothers. The enemies on both series tend of get their body parts blown off a lot, but they just regenerate themselves. The orchestrated soundtracks are really good and fitting for the situations they're used in, and battles tend to span multiple episodes. 
Both feature Teen's boy with terrible home-live, fighting to protect humanity, alone with their sibling and Blonde sidekick. Have very engaging stories, with actual character development and plot-twist a plenty.Both are very famous in the Anime Community, so you really should watch both  
- Eren and Ed both lose their mother and this changes their lives for ever.- Both mothers happen to be voiced by Yoshino Takamori. Coincidence? I think not.- Similar amount of gore- Stories that never fail to leave you guessing- Easily breaking all 'typical' shounen story cliches- Lots of thought provoking underlying messages- NO blatant fanservice and weak female 'damsel in distress' characters- LOTS of badassery- High quality animation, AMAZING OSTs and faithful-to-the-manga adaptions- Historical settingsThe two anime have similar underlying themes but are different in terms of actual plot so it's easy to compare them without feeling like one is ripped off from the other. If you like one you should definitely watch the other. read more 
Both set in the past but with some form of futuristic technology. Both protagonists start off as young children and the story is about them maturing and becoming strong. Both have dark themes and good action sequences. 
While both series are basically not comparable to anything else ever created i think they have similarities in the realism of characters in there reactions to situations.  
Both series involve main characters who face through extremely difficult situations from loss, revenge, sadness, pain, and suffering. Edward Elric and Eren Jaeger have a strong drive that motivates them to achieve their goals as Edward wants to recover his body back from committing a taboo while Eren wants to not only adventure outside the walls, but also wants to kill all Titans. They also want to protect their friends no matter what the cost is.There are many plot twists and many moments within both series where you don't know what the outcome will be. They have a lot of suspense and have very intriguing stories. However, the story in Attack on Titan is darker than FMA.Both series have a vast array of characters who all serve a purpose to the main story. You really come to love some of these characters as you see them develop or change and some have unique personalities. However, you never know which characters will survive until the end.Both series involve the protagonists facing enemies who seem almost invincible and must use their skills and wit to outmatch them. They also have plenty of beautifully animated action scenes and powerful soundtracks with orchestras that draw you into the story even more. read more 
Both protagonists from Shingeki no Kyojin and FMA:B (Eren and Edward repectively) have lost their mothers and both their fathers are missing. Both protagonists are arguably of European descent and live in a westernized world. They are both determined to make things right in a cruel world but they quickly realize the dream they are chasing concerns not only themselves and the people the hold dear but the rest of the world too. All the while, they try to figure out the enigma that is the world they live in and reconcile themselves with the cruelty of such a world and a sense of helplessness that it engenders. Both protagonists aim to reach their goal but in order to do so they must join the military, not knowing where it will take them.  read more 
Both main characters have a goal to pursue. Both animes are full of light-hearted, dark and serious moments and both have plot twists which will leave you speechless. 
Let me start off with how both anime are complete masterpieces. You will notice some anime have good stories but aren't well told. These, however, are on godly levels.The most enjoyable anime are the intense ones, and fullmetal alchemist delivers. I wasn't kidding when I said that it is on a godly level. Not like in dbz where goku surpassed god in the first series, but to the point where the main villian in the show must sacrifice the entire world to gain the literal earth-shattering power to kill the god people admire so much. And only then will he unlock the true secrets of the universe. And then a traumatized soldier boy must stop him in order to gain his brothers long lost body from the never-ending door of knowedge.Holy sh*t.If you liked attack on titan, chances are you'll enjoy this. read more

Both are about a main character that lived a normal life but one day their life turns dark and grim, full of tragedy and agony due to losing someone close to them, both main characters refuse to move on from their past which makes them want redemption and revenge  
Revenge, Suffering, Agony and Redemption...Shingeki no Kyojin has a feeling of FMA Brotherhood in which a kid who lived a peaceful life gets thrown into a dark grim life full of tragedy and agony due to losing someone important to them. However, both main characters refused to move on and dedicated their lives for revenge and redemption.If you enjoy a full packed action dramatic plot you'll love both of these series.  
These anime series share the same formula, you can see other recommendations where people already mentioned those similarities. FMA has a little more light and funny tone with cheesy jokes and funny characters, while AoT is much more brutal and gives a lot of sad and dramatic moments, giving a taste of despair. Despite those differences they are very similar and the plot is quite intriguing. I enjoyed both, FMA is my favorite and AoT is the second favorite, but it may change when the story of AoT will be finished. 
Similar settings: vaguely fantastic medieval Europe in the throes of unstable governance. 
Fullmetal Alchemist (FA) has super humans or homunculus that preys on humans. Shingeki no Kyojin has Titans doing the same thing. Both anime is about the survival of human against a stronger species. Both are packed with action.Both anime have protagonists aging about 15-16 years old.Both have characters having European names.Both anime belong to the Military genre. 
A lot of fans have drawn similarities between the plot and the characters - Edward and Eren have very similar goals, character arcs, and backstories. The plot is also very similar - tragic childhood (Eren's mother was devoured by a Titan before his father went missing, and Edward's mother died due to an epidemic after his father went AWOL - he and Alphonse later attempted the sin of human transmutation in an attempt to resurrect her), etc. Both have a ton of action, feels, and great characters. Just watch out for the fandoms. 
Both are in the action and adventure genre, and both have this intense level of suspense that keeps you on your toes throughout the whole series. Both also have wonderful character development. 
Two legendary animes you must watch before you die Similarities:The loss of mothers plays a significant roll in shaping the characteristics of the protagonists of these two shows.The main characters are siblings + childhood friendAlmost the same amount of blood/violence/goreThere are also some strong female characters, without fan service

Like shingeki no kyojin, Fullmetal alchemist: Brotherhood no have mercy with they characters, it`s a ""realistic shounen"" and the history is well planned. You will never be disappointed with animation here, this show have a great production and the fight are very credible.For much people this anime are the best and i not i don`t agree but this thoght is very understandable. Have fun! ;} 
Both have amazing action scenes with a great story and characters 
Since Shingeki no Kyojin writer, Isayama Hajime announced that SNK anime and manga both end at the same time, I can only think of one anime that is as same as it, Fullmetal Alchemist : Brotherhood.Spoilers:They share many similarities.Characters, e.g.Edward = Eren Alphonse = ArminWinry = MikasaGrisha = Van Hohenheim Carla = TrishaRoy Mustang = LeviThey have some great fighting scenes and background music. It makes me enjoy. Most importantly, they are both great shows not because of popularity  but quality. They show some significant issues like equivalent exchange and freedom. Therefore, I would like to recommend these two of the all-time great shows. 
Both series gets darker and more interesting as the series progresses.Both series have interesting fighting system though Attack on titan, as shown in the series always had a disadvantage with the human side as their nature bothers them.Both series uses their military and government aspects very well and both series were pretty strategic/intelligent. 
Both are insanely overrated,mostly 2 of this are very enjoyable,snk is splitted to a season while fmab is a long paced anime(64 ep)Take snk if u want enjoyment and thrill,take fmab if u want story 
Attack on Titan is known for its tightly woven plot and standout story, and Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is the only show I've seen that not only meets the high quality of AOT, but surpasses it. If your favorite parts of Attack on Titan were its cast of characters, the mystery presented, and the many layers of the story, then Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is the best show to watch to get more of this! "
16498,30,29,"Many have linked Attack on Titan to Evangelion since long before AoT's anime came to be, for highly spoilerific (NOT MECHA) reasons. To be slightly less vague, Eva deconstructed the feel good / manly / heroic mecha genre with a combination of depression and tragedy. And, to a lesser extent, AoT went against the flow of shounen fighting cliches/tropes enough to make it stand out in the same way. So, both series' differences from the norm makes them comparable, in essence. Unlike in its manga, near the end (ep24) AoT's anime had Eren act very much like Shinji from Eva: needing a peptalk and FULL EPISODE of agonizing to... do what was required. And - also anime only - then came ep25 with the most obvious Eva reference I've seen: a character standing watching a battle of gigantic proportions, an arm flying off towards him and blood splattering; his reaction being the same non-reaction as Gendo's in Eva. Whether the AoT anime team did these things well aware of the Eva similarities in order to add more meat to the Eva-AoT argument, I know not. But it isn't the first time a popular anime was referenced: a character does her very best Kira impression in ep23--the director of both Death Note and AoT being one and the same. read more 
Both series revolve around Humanity trying to fight powerful enemies they don't quite understand, and young people are forced to take up the fight. Tragic events are common occurrences. giant humanoids are used to fight. Shingeki likely was heavily inspired by Evangelion. 
The humanity is trying to survive an attack of almighty titans, after episode 8 there are more similarities... 
Mankind is in the brink of elimination as mysterious creatures suddenly come from unknown origins to end their existence.The only hope for man is in the hands of a young boy who has the ability to control a power equal to these mysterious creatures.This power is not easily controlled however as the boy at times allows this ability to go berserk as he encounters emotionally driven situations.Epic battles occur as the boy controls this power to combat these enormous titans amongst a ruined city.The question is, am I describing Shingeki no Kyojin or Evangelion? However, as in my case, if you absolutely love one, you most definitely will love the other. While watching, my mouth was usually down in utter shock throughout each episode with both of these works of art. read more 
Both are similar with a very dark tone and focus on the human condition. Attack on titan focus more on existentialism and ethics. It also is action heavy; the visuals alone make it a good watch. Whereas Evangelion focuses on mental illness and transhumanism. Evangelion tends to be lighter on action and violence. However it covers much more mature content and isn't far more disturbing. 
Humanity unites against monstrosities.  Shingeki feels like Medieval Evangelion sometimes.  Evangelion has more depression, Shingeki has more despair.   
Both deal with earth being under attack by monsters (titans and angels), both have young people who are tasked with protecting it, the main characters both have difficult relationships with their fathers. 
Some unknown origin creatures invaded humanity, both are constantly fighting a losing battle while human trying to survive. 
Both series deal with ambiguous creatures that threaten all of humanity, a young protagonist with a connection to said creatures, and have a more of a realistic take on their respective genres. 
This seems to already be a popular recommendation, so I""ll be brief:Both have...-giant monsters that have almost wiped out all of humanity.-organizations set to wipe out those said monsters.-a lot of plot twists that (more so in SnK's case) leave you hanging in a cruel way.-utterly messed up and convoluted stories and characters.They are both anime that have messed up my brain in a good way, and I love Evangelion and Kyojin for that. 
Humanity is in despair and they are fighting with the very things they want to kill. 
Humanity fights back against giant mononstrosities that threaten to wipe out the human race. Both are exciting anime with plenty of action in addition to beautiful visuals, but each has a different setting and focus. AoT is a dark fantasy with a greater focus on mystery and world-building, while Evangelion is more of a psychological thriller that uses its modern day sci-fi/mech setting as the backdrop. 
I would go far as to say the Shingeki no Kyojin does have it far share of similarites to Neon Genesis Evangelion. Behind all the window dressing, the to show are quite similar if you think about.Both stories take place in a post post apocalyptic world meaning the apocalyspe had already has prior to the series start and that the world is slowing rebuilding from said apocalypse and have devise ways against their oppression since. Humanity is own falling legs in spite of oppressive and enigmatic enemy. In Neon Genesis Evangelion the oppressive force is the Angels. In Attack on Titan its the titular Titans.The main character learns he is the only able to pilot a giant robot. In Neon Genesis Evangelion, Shinji pilots the Eva Unit 01. In Attack on Titan, Eren is able to turn into the Rogue Titan. The Rogue Titan is even introduced very similar to Eva Unit 01 in almost every way. It even goes berserk several times in the story.Both weapon on the key to turning the tides of the war in their favor.The two show also have very similar atmosphere being both dark and brooding. In both series, mankind is in fear of its enemy knowing little to nothing about them. The enemy is numerous and only get stronger after each encounter.In both series, the character are severely flawed and are by no means ideal.In both series, the humanity's enemy is not whom they are fighting against but it is themselves.I say if you like one you are bound to find to something to like in the other. read more 
fight for survival of human race, very hard to kill enemies, lost of psychology what do you want more lol 
Attack on titan focuses on fighting with superior (Titans) beings and retaking the walls. Neon Genesis focuses by defending their city by superior (Angels)  beings  from causing 3rd Impatct (end of the world), while neon genesis does character development very well with everyone being depressed, Attack on Titans tries to by brining male tears. 
SNK and NGE may have a very different fanbases, but when it comes down to it, there are many things that are similar about these two series. SNK and NGE are series that both revolve around a young both trying to save his city/town/world from giant monsters. Even though the devices used to destroy these monsters are different (three dimensional maneuver devices in SNK, giant human-operated machines in NGE)There are also three teenage characters who are pressured to do a lot of risky work in order to save their city/town/world. Although the I believe that that Shinji, Misato, and Rei and better written characters with more complexity and depth to their stories, both series feature strong leads that are (at least in my opinion) the stand out quality of these series and are part of what makes them unique.  read more 
The three main characters in each show are very similar. Both main characters have fathers who abandoned them at a young age, and their mother also died when they were young. Both have a group of ""monsters"" (Titans and Angels) that humans have to fight against in order to survive as a species. Both of these shows are also very dark and psychological.  
Both are set in a post-apocalyptic world with enemy's that are far superior in strength to our protagonists with a teenage boy as the lead protagonist. Both anime have strong sets of female characters in it's cast, and the main protagonist's father in both anime shows no interest in their son's lives. 
Both of these shows have similar setup where humanity is in danger because of strong enemy that's trying to push humans to extinction. There is mystery behind those attacks.Action in both shows is exciting and well executed. 
SnK and Evangelion, two series mainstream and almost cult, where they possess these similarities:- Postapocalyptic world dominated by a superior species (Titans in SnK and Angeles in EVA), that caused the destruction of humans.- A group specializes in defending humans from these monsters.- The protagonist is entrusted with a power similar to that of the angels and is almost forced / manipulated to participate in this mortal battle, where he will be the only one able to turn the situation. Where he spent the whole series questioning himself and how everything works around him. In addition they lost their mother and their father is very distant to him, which is responsible for their ability.- Humanity lives locked in a place built for its own protection.- There is a secret kept by they most powerful of the city, about the origin of these monsters. read more 
-Teenagers are given the responsibility of defending humanity-Both have a superior life form attacking humanity (Angels, Titans)-Similar main characters (Asuka = Eren, Rei = Mikasa, Shinji = Armin) 
Both survival assumptions,But this show does not focus on the psychological of its characters and the characters have super powers. 
Both serries happens in the end of humanity,  both have characters with similar aspects and both have fights  which the mc against giant ""monsters"" 
While I'm not a fan of Shingeki no Kyojin (and Neon Genesis Evangelion is obviously my favorite anime) these two have some in common. They both have a cowardly main character, they both are about defending humanity from something, etc. 
Both series follow young people who are recruited into a military organization dedicated to fighting colossal beings that threaten humanity. Connections between humans and these enemies are explored as well as the enormous losses incurred while fighting them. 
Humanity tries to survive the attack of monstrous creatures 
Thematics are similar. Catasthrophic worlds, with a twisted inside story, and a lot of misteries to solve. The protagonist are a bit similar in their personalities. I don't know what much else to say. It's great, okay? 
they both giant humanoids 
It sucked at first,but after the mystery begins,in the end,it's all makes sense... "
16498,37521,17,"In both anime there are: * Brutal worlds where characters have to kill to stay alive. * Revenge for the lost ones. * Beautiful visuals (same studio). So if you like the elements mentioned you should definitely check them out. 
-Both main characters are infected with the burning desire for revenge-Both have have similar worlds from a technological standpoint-Both have a few main characters but manage to make the side characters feel just as important and relevant 
As other recommendations have said, these shows were made by the same studio and have too many similar qualities to count. I can almost guarantee that if you like one of these series, you will the other. Similarities include:- a revenge-motivated protagonist with unique natural ability for combat- similar protagonists as a whole. honestly- blurred moral lines- violence- similar art and combat scenes- unique setting. Vinland Saga is a rare historical anime surrounding what best is summarized as the Viking age, while Attack on Titan appears to be in a foreign alternative universe that shares some similarities to medieval England. 
Blood, blades and vengeance.A young boy lives a peaceful life, dreaming of adventure and glory. It finds him, ripping his world apart with visceral cruelty. Left with nothing but his hatred, he takes up a sword and vows to carve a path through the world that wronged him. 
-darker stories and worlds-same studio (Wit Studio)-both are somewhat grounded in history (German architecture and Nordic Vikings and combat)-have likable side characters-protagonists who want revenge 
Both of the series are similar because their genre is War and chaos. 
-They both have a young male protagonist who wants to avenge his dead parent-Both Eren (AOT protagonist) and Thorfinn (VS protagonist) do have anger issues-Also, you watch both of them growing up in the show and they both have amazing character development-They both realize that revenge is pointless-Both have to do with ""slavery""-Both have lots of blood, cool fights, death, op characters and wars-Lastly, they will both give you depression 
it is made by the same studio, the story is amazing and worth watching, and it's both shonen :D. 
Both anime come from the same studyBeautiful visualsVery good and excellent way to tell the storyCharacters with excellent developmentAlthough the story is based on the protagonist, he is not the only one with weight in the plotExcellent fight scenes 
-Both Are Great Dark Seinen Shows-Both protagonists ,Eren/Thorfinn are driven by one of their parents death-Both vow revenge on their parents killer(titans/askeladd)-Both long to see the world outside their small haven,The walls/the village 
Vinland Saga (in addition to Owari no Seraph which has many recommendations that you should check out) is made by Wit Studio.- wit studio tends to animate lots of manga/lightnovels that have similar genres. -art style similarThe protagonists of VS and SnK are both soooo annoying. -They each have something they want to kill:Eren=titans, cause they killed his mom Thorfinn= askella,  because he (his followers) killed his dad.-Askellad and Levi are very similar. Cold asf, don't mind killing everything in their path, dark pasts, etc. -lots of killing 
Perfectly matches each other for revenge. In Attack on titan, Eren Jaeger seeks revenge for his mothers death and the destruction of his home town done by the human eating giants known as ""Titans"" He sweared to kill every single Titan to bring the freedom of all the people inside the huge walls they used to live in for protecting themselves from Titans. Again, in Vinland Saga Thorfinn seeks revenge for his fathers death by killing Askellad,who killed him. In future both of them starts to know their own identities clearly and the past life of their people. 
These two anime series are actually from the same company! I feel like Vinland saga is underrated because of Shingeki. Don't get me wrong, Shingeki is amazing but I really liked Vinland as much as I did for Shingeki. They are both action animes with Vinland Saga being a historical anime about vikings. Both have very deep messages and.. oh gosh.. a lot of killing. Anyways, plz watch Vinland! (also, can't wait for season 2!)  
both are in medieval settings, badass characters, brutal action, good world building 
A wonderful combination of good story line with outstanding action. It tells the journey of young boy who is thrown into difficult circumstances due to war. The best thing is the anime is loosely based on history. It is a highly underrated anime if you like dark action genre. If you've watch Attack On Titans , you simply cannot miss this.  
If you like the bloody complex and grounded politics and action of Attack On Titan, you will most likely love Vindland Saga 
The same studio that animated snk, the main character is so cold and has a monstrous development throughout the anime. The protagonist is also an unparalleled genius, always one step ahead of the others "
16498,38000,13,"- Both follow protagonists who lose a lot and face trauma in the first episode - Fighting demons is similar to fighting titan, both eat humans as well- Similar demon slaying corp to the military police  
Both involve tragedies to our main heroes family right at the start of series.Both involve formidable monsters who prey on humans and the few dedicated enough to fight and combat the issue on the front lines.Both have dark/demonic themes. 
Both anime has a fight between humanity and Titans/Demons. Bigger enemy is scary, strong and hard to defeat, but there are groups dealing with them. Demon slayers and Survey Corps. Then we have naive main character who looses people that are important to him. Lots of tears, screaming and trying to make things better. Few years of training to become a man and then the MC is out to destroy them all.  
-Both protagonists are left with only their 'sister' character after the demise of the rest of their family members, and swear revenge against the perpetrators-Both protagonists undergo rigorous training and join in a military organization aimed to bring down an evil race terrorizing humans-Both are more deeply grounded in reality than most other fantasy shows 
- Both series follow protagonists who have their family eaten by the titans/demons- Both titans and demons eat humans and are/were humans- The MCs are naive & optimists + after some training, they become VERY strong- Both MCs want to revenge their families 
They have both slaying and fighting antagonist. If you like slaying and fighting  then you probably like attack on titan  
Similarities:1- Both MCs's families were killed by human eating creatures2- humans fight human eating creatures for survival3- These human eating creatures came out of nowhere and threatened humans4- MCs enters the special force which kills and fights these creatures5- MCs are naive & optimists + after some training, they become strong6- Both MCs want to revenge their families7- similar setting and atmosphere 
This two anime is really similar, no, this might even be a copy-paste-modify.(SPOILER) ""not that much"" * Both are fighting a against demon or so-called-devil, which is a Superior Beings for humans.* Both have to cut a specific body part to kill the Superior Being which is the nape (Shingeki no Kyojin) and the whole neck (Kimetsu no Yaiba), jeez.* That SB eats human.* Main character that obtain or become the power of the SB and used that power to fight against them.* Use swords.* A party of people that focus on fighting against the enemy.* Main Character's family member got slaughter by SB, ""in the beginning of the show"".* Both have that amazing a memorable uniform* After the slaughter, the MC started to learn how to kill the SB.* A quiet girl that seems to have an interest to the Protagonist.* The MC's father seems to have a big mystery.* Cute and Hot heroines.* Both show is in old times.* Dope Animation. read more 
While watching kimetsu no Yaiba I got attack on Titan vibesBoth of them has a stunning visuals but being honest I liked the visuals of kimetsu no Yaiba then attack on Titan Just watch this anime u won't be disappointed  
It's not all that similar other than the protagonist grows through tragedy and finds power hidden within him and all the simple yet effective cliche's. Also both are about killin' baddies 
The premise of the whole story is almost the same for both of these. Both have : a MC whose family gets eaten, some sort of organization that fights the creatures, revenge themes, a character(/s) who is a creature, but helps humanity, etc. The biggest difference that I can see is the fact that Shingeki no Kyojin gets more and more political as it goes on (it covers politically based issues and conflicts). I don't see that happening with Kimetsu no Yaiba. 
both are the same tells the adventures of the main character that is full of emotions and blood in the initial episode 
Shingeki no Kyojin and Kimetsu no Yaiba has its similarities, the main one being the idea of humans vs a supernatural creature. It's humans vs titans and demons, respectively. Both creatures have only a certain way of killing them which makes both series amusing and on your toes. Also, the concept of a supernatural creature helping and killing its own kind is also very relevant in both series and enjoyable to watch. "
16498,33,12,"It's safe to say Berserk anime fans were left shocked & traumatised by its haunting finale. You get that feeling on a regular basis with Shingeki as characters are torn to shreds before your eyes. Not as extreme (or as sexual!) as Berserk at its most (in)famous, no, but you get the point. Images that won't leave will remain imprinted in your brain, after viewing--ye be warned!In terms of their settings, Berserk and Shingeki are both set during medieval times. Aside from Shingeki's 'Spiderman' way of doing battle with gigantic threats, you're gonna get a STRONG taste of bleak realism from medieval/fantasy epics, here. Unless you plan on getting up-to-date with Berserk's manga (...), don't expect too much 'happy time' to be found in either. Lighthearted laughs ain't what you're gonna get outta these two! read more 
Both series have many epic moments, a dark atmosphere, and a lot of blood. 
Attack on Titan reminds me of Berserk with its horrifying imagery and medieval setting. 
Both anime deal with Demons, revenge, battle, and are both male power fantasies. If you like one you will like the other. They both have interesting protagonists. There are three anime that are very much similar to Shingeki no Kyojin, Berserk, Claymore, and Hokuto no Ken. I would say out of the 3 Berserk is the one most similar. So I recommend it as have many others and this is a very valid recommendation.  
The concept of fighting and blood being spilled in a dark fantasy world is a theme presented in both Berserk and Shingeki no Kyojin (aka Attack on Titan)There is a moody atmosphere in both series that also involves a lot of action, drama, and emotions between the main characters. It conveys imagery in a way that is violent but fits within the fantasy realm of its medieval like settings.The monsters in both series are also considered a dangerous threat to mankind; survival is a must. 
It has that medieval feel to it as well as all despair, no happiness. Both cause a lot of suffering to the viewer. 
Both series tell a story set in a world where humanity is on the losing side in a war against overwhelmingly powerful and monstrous foes and prospects for the future look as bleak as the present situation. Unless, of course, the heroes of each tale, rise to lead humanity in fighting back against these malevolent and horrifying enemies. 
Both have shocking imagery, are set in medieval settings, have relatively realistic characters with realistic responses and actions, use monsters as symbols of fear, and are awesome.  
Both have similar settings with an abundance of violence and gore. Death and mortality are both common themes. They both focus on a battle between violent creatures (titans/demons). Prominent battle scenes and intense combat make both series engaging and entertaining. 
The main characters are both beasts who overcome obstacles through force of will. Full of action and refreshingly neither are harems or have harem aspects, i.e. the fighting in both is gruesome and is paced well, so there is no boredom and no filler.   
Dark, gritty, and violent anime set in realistic medieval-ish times with doses of dark fantasy. Includes suffering, betrayal, shocking plot twists, great action, amazing storytelling, and all time great soundtracks. 
Both anime are quite horrifying and have some great characters; many of which are absolute badasses. Both have a similar supernatural role in them--whether that be demons are titans. If you like one of them, you'll most likely enjoy the other because of similar dark themes and surprises. "
16498,2001,11,"1. Both have strong character stories2. both have a sense of moving forward3. both have great animationOverall there are a lot of similarities with the story line, being trapped (with giant monsters) striving to achieve something greater for the whole race.  Both shows are very uplifting and fun to watch.  
Humans live trapped in a secluded area in fear of giant monsters. Brave souls, in both anime, wish to venture out into the outside. 
While the style of Gurren Lagann is completely different from that of Shingeki no Kyojin, I couldn't help but be reminded of Gurren Lagann while watching this series. In both series, the main characters are attempting to overthrow a seemingly impossible force and escape from an enclosed environment in order to explore the outside world. Also, both animes have an overly enthusiastic main character, a ""sidekick"" to the main character who appears to be nothing but a crybaby, and a bad-ass female character.  Despite the plot and character similarities though, the two anime are very different. Shingeki no Kyojin is FAR more serious than Gurren Lagann, and this could be either a good or a bad thing depending on your preferences. read more 
SnK and TTGL both have a certain style of art that are very particular. Both focus mainly on two guys and a girl, with other characters coming in from time to time. The main character will sometimes turn into your typical shounen fighter beast, but that's ok because they're both epic nonetheless. From my experience, the goosebumps they give make me watch certain episodes again and again. 
Both aim for the freedom of the human society. both have tragic loses of their loved ones. the story is bloody amazing. you would be mad not to watch both and shed a few tears when you see deaths/ 
Mankind is stuck within a certain place (for Shingeki in walls and Gurren Lagann in caves). In both, they fight the entities that hold them there. 
Both anime deal with the human condition being slowly crushed under the weight of an enormous threat that wages genocide on them seemingly without reason.TTGL however is much less visceral and more lighthearted although possessing just as much testosterone-filled action and determination to succeed against all odds. TTGL is also a deconstruction of the mecha genre and anime in general. It is a semi-parody(in classic Gainax style) but also includes a fair amount of drama, good characters and serious plot. The war presented in TTGL does have its deeper moments, and great twists brought about by the characters and their reactions to the escalating challenges they face... but nowhere near as much as SNK.Shingeki no Kyojin is a much darker anime, with a much more present sense of hopelessness and is primarily psychological, a deconstruction of the human condition. It depicts much more hopelessness, fear, selfishness, betrayal, loss, and suffering. I would rate SNK being the better of the two however read more 
Both series involve a story where the characters are enclosed within some sort of barrier as there are potential threats that reside outside of that barrier. The main protagonists of both series have big dreams to travel outside their enclosed realm and adventure out into the unknown.Both series involve over the top battles with beautifully animated action scenes. Also, there are many epic scenes that showcase over the top drama and tension.Both series involve a vast array of interesting characters. However, because of the imminent dangers that they must face, you don't know which characters will survive until the end. 
Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann involves being locked inside an underground city and battling robots, which is very similar to Shingeki no Kyojin, where they are surrounded by walls and battle titans. 
Sort of post-apocalyptic and focuses on a young protagonist as you see them grow up and go through different things. 
Society living enclosed from the outside world and basically both MCs wanna go see the outside world which is nothing that they expected it to be. Many challenges face their way as they try their best to eradicate all their enemies that face their way and reclaim the world for human kind "

Humanity is in trouble.Everything hits the fan several times.Male protagonist has ability to save the day in some regards.Lots of ""Learning about the enemy"".Terror and gore common. 
-Both are pretty gory.-Both have very real, intense scenes that emphasize the fear of the characters.-Both have 'monsters' that you want to know more about.-Both show humanity fighting these 'monsters' for survival.-Both MC's have similar motives for fighting.I think if you enjoyed one, you would enjoy the other. 
Both anime feature a good amount of violence and disturbing imagery as well as  a lot of themes about humanity and the characters fighting for it. They intrigue you by making you want to find out more about the monsters they star and then just when you think that you've figured it out they flip it on its head and change how the monsters can and/or do act. The level of threat that both anime manage to build is very real and the when the intense scenes come, BOY are they intense. Neither show holds back on what they will and won't throw at you. On top of similar themes, the main character and his motives for fighting these creatures are also somewhat the same as are certain mysteries in the show - so go ahead and check it out! read more 
Both anime involve powerful alien-like creatures that have a directive to kill humans. MC can use these powers to fight back. The moral dilemma ""am i turning into a monster"" is very present in too. Gory brutal action with a fine dramatic story in a different setting. 
Both focus on the conflict between humans and some kind of 'other' being with an underlining exploration of what it means to be human. Gritty art in both with some gore.  
Both have leads that have the same powers/abilities as the enemyBoth leads become more powerful after being in the verge of deathBoth are horrifying and creepyBoth have leads fighting to save humanity from a mysterious enemyBoth have enemies that eat humans for no reasonKiseijuu like shingeki no kyojin are beautiful done anime with heartwarming scenes and memorable characters that you will remember and grow to love these are truly one of the best anime I have ever seen 
In both anime, a dangerous creature threatens humanity and the main character somehow gets hold or becomes a part of the group that threatens humanity however with his naive rightousness and sense of justice, he finds a way to use the creature to fight it’s own kind. 
I feel like attack on titan is a shounen take on Parasyte, or vice-versa, so if you'd like to see a more seinen approach to a monster/ action/ thriller series, then Parasyte is a must watch.They both tackle the core concept of, ""what makes someone a monster"" and if you enjoy that psychological aspect of attack on titan, and how that moves Erens character and shapes his development, I can garantee that you will like Parasyte, as this concept is the key theme used to show how most of the characters develop in parasyte. "
16498,1535,8,"Both have a dark, gritty atmosphere. The main characters are interesting, and very well-developed. Death lurks behind every corner in both anime, and the Japanese voice acting is professional. Make sure to check them both out, as they both are really good and stay true to the manga. 
At first glance it might seem stupid, but these two shows are directed by the same director, so they are at the same level exciting, entertaining and enjoyable. Also they are very memorable. 
Both got gore, if you like either one you would love the other one. both have got adventure mystery and fighting.  
Both series bring alot of human emotion into it and both will bitch slap you at moments when you thought hope was lost. 
Both are awesome shounen, thriller and mystery animes. Shingeki No Kyojin / Attack on Titan just has more action. The thrill just gives me goosebumps everytime. These animes are a must watch! 
A cold world. Some worlds are so damned, that those who haven't even passed high school feel the need to go out of their way to change the world. Death Note and Attack on Titan are no expectations, protagonists who understand the cold and dark world end up using what have their strength in a means to change the order of how things work.Death Note having Light become a serial killer, in an attempt to become the 'God of the New World' by ridding evil from the earth. AOT having childhood friends: Eren, Mikasa, and Armin join the survey crops to slay all titans after Eren's mom died from a titan.Both are great anime for the shounen demographic, with Death Note being a mystery psychological featuring mind games, AOT being and action-military featuring all-out carnage. Either way, a ton of 'the enemies' perish. read more

thriller, mystery, psychologicalthe main character is an anti- villainand don't try to make assumptions about the plot progression...with twists and turns in the most unexpected places and times, making assumptions would just be a waste of time!!!tip: the 1st season of SNK (AOT) is a little slow paced...so it will be better to get a little spoiled.... "
16498,11061,8,"These two anime are depressing to watch. SnK is fully depressing but HxH is like cheerful at first then becoming a psychological kind of anime at the last part. Either way, these two have bad-ass female characters. 
Shingeki no Kyojin is focusing on titans eating humans and they do this for no known reason. And even though most of hunter x hunter dosen't have people getting eaten I still think the current arc (Chimera Ant Arc) in Hunter x Hunter is similar because of how dark it is. People are getting eaten and killed, It has the same feeling of hopelessness especially later in the arc and it's just way darker than most shounens.. They are not afraid to go more mature and use more matures themes 
It's similar because it's much darker than all the popular ongoing shounens.. Even though hunter x hunter seems abit lighthearted at first don't be fooled because it's one series that is not afraid to kill of people.. And the current arc of hunter x hunter focuses on the so called Chimera Ants eating people which is very similar to shingeki no kyojin.. And it also has gives you the same feeling of hopelessness.. I've read both mangas and I know that the chimera ant arc gets really dark and makes you feel there is no hope just like shingeki no kyojin 
The Chimera ant arc of Hunter x Hunter 2011 is very similar to Shingeki no Kyojin: in Snk people are eaten by Titans,in Hunter x Hunter by Chimera Ant. Also,they're both different,darker and more mature shonens,completely different from clichè shonens like Naruto,Ao no exorcist ecc. I wonder why HxH is still rated PG-13. 
This is a shonen with dark theme, gore, monster eating human in the chimera ant arc. This isn't a cliche anime, there is the same feeling of hopelessness in the chimera ant arc and in the Phantom Troupe arc. 
Shingeki no Kyojin is a very violent anime that isn't afraid to kill off characters, and that is one of the reasons so many people love the anime. This cruelty can be seen right when you look at the promotional art from the series. Hunter x Hunter is very similar to Kyojin in the fact that death is not held back, but unlike Kyojin you cant tell that just by looking at it. Don't be fooled by the happy childish outside, HxH is brutal ride filled with death of characters you knew just long enough to fall in love with. If you like anime with a great story, characters , action, and music that doesn't hold back death, then you will LOVE HxH. read more 
The two have similar action, in the side both are not all ""fight-hard"" but more psychological action. Interesting changing plot with all full of awesome characters (a lot of cast!!).The Chimera Ant arc in Hunter x Hunter is quite similar to the whole Shingeki series, having their respectively ""human-eating"" beings.(Also, the design of some characters are SO similar you could say are the same XD) 
First of all, these 2 anime are probably anime you've heard of because its one of the popular anime. The similarities in these 2 anime are that the MC is going on a quest and fighting for their family. The difference is that the Attack on Titan MC is fighting to save his city and to also protect his family. In Hunter x Hunter the MC seeks out on an adventure where he fights and meets other people to locate his Dad and find out why his Dad left him at such a young age to become a Hunter. Attack on Titan is the short one with 59 episodes. Hunter x Hunter is the long one with 148 episodes. Hope this helped. read more "

The characters want to uncover the mysteries of their world or nation. In Shingeki, they want to explore the outside world but cannot because of Titans. In Made in Abyss, they want to uncover the bottom of the abyss but it is not an easy task. There are dangers everywhere. They both have also special elite forces to who can handle the dangers.

the characters, the animation, the plot and music everything is just perfect. Shingeki no kyojin is full of gore and violence but is justified. The scenes can get quite intense so if you don't like gore then it will be better if you avoid watching it. The characters those are well established can die as well and that is what makes it more realistic. 
Both are serious animes with mature themes, focused on war, with a lot of blood spilled. Both animes are about fighting for freedom against greater power, in SNK case Titans, in Code Geass case empire that control most of the planet. In both cases main protagonist has some kind of a superpower that allows him to fight the undefeatable enemy.  
A disturbed balance. Attack on Titan and Code Geass understand characters who want to fight the life they once lived in the past, through these tales, these characters grow with a strong desire to collapse the opposing force that wishes to give them otherwise.Eren and Lelouch join their respective teams to fight for the respect of human lives, Eren joining the Survey Crops, Lelouch becomes Zero, founding the Black Nights.Both are great action-military anime with epic fights around every corner, whether it be a mind game or physical action.

If epic shounen-y shows with a healthy dose of well-thought out plot, angst-driven characters, and the theme of people battling forces larger than themselves, only to discover that the biggest obstacles are actually themselves, float your boat, then current watchers of this season's mega-epic must not miss (and likely have already watched) Fate/Zero, the only Type-Moon related series to receive a superb adaptation.Toss in epic soundtracks created by two musical titans of the industry (Yuki Kajiura of .hack, Madoka, and SAO-fame, just to reference her most recent works; Hiroyuki Sawano of Sengoku Basara, Guilty Crown, and Gundam Unicorn epicness), and these two will go down as must-watches for the ages. read more

What's also important to mention is that both shows have an element of scientific mystery; as you watch you'll find out more and more about the new creatures that inhabit the Earth through the characters' own investigations.  
Both are anime that are set in the future where the state of humanity was worse, a distopia. 
Both anime are set in a false utopia, and as the story progresses, the protagonists learn more about the cruel secrets of their respective worlds. Plus, Shingeki no Kyojin has a similar thrilling effect to Shinsekai Yori.

After watching Attack on Titan I went on to watch the EVA rebuilds and it helped me realize how many similarities there are between them. While not a mecha, Attack on Titan has a lot of very similar characteristics(no spoilers, but if you've seen AoT, you'll probably be able to understand what I'm getting at). Eren, Armin and Mikasa are all similar to Rei, Asuka, and Shinji. Though they swap around a few traits here and there.

Both shows present very interesting settings, and part of the fun is just learning about the world and its mysteries. 
I would rather not spoil all of Attack on Titan but these shows can be strikingly similar when looked at closely.  The enemies in Attack on Titan (the the titans) hold an unusual likeness to Houseki no Kuni's Lunarians.

The story of the two are about accepting the world, beating the unbeatable opponents and taking care of your loved ones. As tough as SNK is, it has always been about the dreams of those characters, their struggle to live and succeed, to be the ""best worst generation"", something that One Piece is always so good at!I've actually started watching One Piece after I've watched 2 seasons of SNK, so I was able to catch the moments where you can just tell that the mangaka of SNK liked it so much that he took some of the ideas from OP and reworked them in SNK.As of violence, I'd say that the violence in SNK is not the lustful one, it's there to move the story and not to satisfy someone's desire for blood and gore, the Titans action doesn't strike you as disgusting because of their perfect visual design and the way SNK shows the violent things. One Piece might not look like it has any tough moments, battles at first but the series progresses throughout its course and things are never the same.One Piece and Shingeki no Kyojin are these two anime that are always going to make me happy and I do encourage you to take your time and enjoy One Piece. No skipping any of the episodes, no rewinding; just try to sit back, relax and get used the the way One Piece tells its stories. I can promise that if you will be fully open and patient, One Piece will most likely be the best thing to happen with you in terms of anime. read more

877,57,25,"Music, music, music. Both series have great music scores to keep you entertained, not to mention the underlining drama that eats away at each character. Even if you're not a fan of the drama, you'll probably end up enjoying the music in some sense~ 
Both are good music series. Competition of two bands, romance, drama, and of course good music. Must see both 
Nana feels like the love-child of Beck and Honey & Clover.  If you liked Nana, I'd suggest Beck if you liked the struggling band/musical aspects of Nana.  And vice versa. =) 
Nana and Beck tell us about the musical industry and everything concerning the creative process. We'll meet naive novices and tycoons of record labels, rookies and stars. Although in Nana the story is focused on love and relationships, it's also about the life of musicians, including live shows in small clubs, the recording process, promotion and music videos. If you want to know more about the musical industry you'll enjoy watching these series. 
Both series are done by Mad House. Both have their good share of drama and music, and overall the atmosphere is similar. They both have similar characters and the struggle of a new band trying to show this world their talent. 
Music and life.Both are great anime about a group of friends trying to make a rock band.Slice of life, drama, and romance are the predominant elements of both series (Nana is more girl-oriented, though).There is also the competition between 2 rival bands.We see the characters growing up during the series, and struggling to make their dreams come true.Also, both anime are by Mad House, and Takumi and Ryusuke are similar. 
Both anime have a theme of music, BECK is more of a music fans anime while NANA is more centered toward a shoujo audience . never the less both anime are amoung my favourite. Although I feel BECK is my favourite anime of all time NANA is the closest anime you will get related to rock music. (next to BECK that is) 
Both NANA & Beck are focused on music. NANA has female main characters and the serie centers around them. Also, they're already in their twenties. Beck on the other hand has young boys as main characters. Their both great to watch and have their own amount of music and drama. 
both are portraying a struggling rock band for their path to popularity, their love problems, friendship... although, nana is a more emotional, and from a girls point of view, while in beck, except their music (and all around it), we do not get to know their other side: family. both have some great music, that will stuck to your mind hours and days later. enjoy! 
There both are about trying to make it big in a band and falling in love. 
Revolving around music and in a way relationships. Beck is more of an anime I'd recommend if you enjoy having your adrenline pumping. Captivating, slow at times but worth every minute of every episode. Catchy music.Nana, more if you want to have your heart thumping, rising, tears in your eyes. Yet still some essences of adreanline. Creative characters, good story lines. Overall both series are MUST-WATCH for all music fans be they pop music, indie, rock, heavy metal, punk.  
Both focus on the mentality and hard work it takes to become the biggest rock band in the world. Both feature AMAZING soundtracks plus references to big rock bands. 
Great and about music both 
Both are well-received anime centered around drama and music. Both have fantastic soundtracks.  
Wow, both of these series reminds me of one and the other in a variety of ways.Both series features music as a prominent theme. They have a band who are trying to make a name of themselves in the music industry. But more than that, there is a complex friendship between the two main characters in both series.Beck and Nana are like brothers and sisters imo. They have comedy, romance, drama, and is presented in a mature way that is more than the typical shoujo/high school romances. Both series also has that slice of life feeling detailing some of the events of the characters' every day lives whether involving their careers or their love lives.  read more 
If you like Beck you might just enjoy Nana. They both have rock bands and awesome music and are pretty realistic. The only difference is Beck is light, comedic and shounen. Nana makes you cry its Shoujo. 
Nana and Beck have very similar feeling. When I was watching Beck, I remembered all my feelings about Nana. Also both have really great music and they are uncomparable to other animes from music genre.  
Slice of life very similar taking place in a group of emerging music , combining musical passion and love passion in camera ... own dramatic tone for this special period that the transition from adolescence to adulthood where every failure is a deep wound , and every passion a religion. I have seen Nana there a long time now but I have always this feeling of desperate intensity among dream , hope, resignation, duty ... Two animated reflects very well our first steps in the world torn by our hopes and discovery of our limitsSlice of life très similaires qui prennent place dans un groupe de musique naissant , mêlant passion musicale et passion amoureuse en huis clos... un ton dramatique propre à cette période si particulière qu'est la transition de l'adolescence à l'age adulte où chaque échec est une profonde blessure et chaque passion une religion . J' ai vu Nana il y a fort longtemps maintenant mais j' ai toujours cette sensation d'intensité déséspérée entre rêve, espoir, résignation, devoir...Deux animés reflétant très bien nos premières armes dans le monde tiraillés par nos espérances et la découverte de nos limites. read more 
Both of these two anime revolve around the topic music in one way or another, for example they both involve bands trying to make their debut. The overall feeling is the same, in both they are dealing with everyday issues and things that ""ordinary"" people can relate to. 
The two dominant music-dramas in anime/manga, for good reason. Both feature excellent rock based soundtracks and deal in the realistic when it comes to human drama. Beck is more of a ""breaking out of your shell and do something"" story, while Nana is more about the pitfalls that come with freedom as young adults. Nana's a stronger work, but Beck's really easy to watch, so I'd start with it if you haven't seen either. 
they both are centered around music and drama and romance.however, nana has more drama and romance than beck while beck has more music.but both are still really enjoyable and if you like one you would probably like the other 
- Both Beck and Nana deal with the hardships that certain people face as they attempt to make themselves and their music known, as well as deal with other day-to-day conflicts. - Both Nana and Beck deal with the lives of musicians and how people can be changed by music. - In each of the series there is a band that is trying to get started up, and become a group that everyone knows. - Nana and Beck both tells us about the musical industry and everything concerning the creative process.- In both series they show the sacrifices that need to be made while in a band as well as relationships and hardships that must be dealt with in everyday life.While differences between from the shows' intended audience--Nana, a josei; and Beck, a shounen--are clear, both believably chart the growth in its main character's maturity with wonderful relationships to supporting characters, love interests, and the abstraction of the music business as an antagonist. These anime are top notch in the music genre. If you enjoyed one of the series because of its writing as well as music concepts you will no doubt more than enjoy the other.  read more 
Nana and Beck are two music anime, that are about the life of a musician and the creative process, that goes into what they´re doing. They´re both heavily focused around rock music and have a score to complement such. 
Nana is an wonderful example for a well done combination of slice of life, with very good development of its characters and their relationships, and an insight in the later punk music scene. If you like good melodrama, with a charming kind of sophisticated, fitting humor presenting compelling characters in an extremely impressive music arrangement & astonishing seiyû, you should try ""Nana"" too.Beck and Nana are not identical but they do hit the same tone in the best sense of the word. 
Music, feelings and Love.While Beck  is more focused on Music industry , Nana Deals with love and a lot drama and at the same time with concerts, music and lifes of musicians. "
877,12531,6,"Both series have a very mature approach in romance and relationships. Music is also an important factor in both series, but romance and drama predominate. 
They are very similar:* Both are Josei, Slice of life, drama* The two male protagonists from SNA are like the female protagonists from Nana, being great friends even with their differences.* The love story in both have realism and conflicts (but I think there are more conflicts in Nana)* They are about music I'm sure if you like one you'll like the other. 
Both are about music, and characters who have to deal with complicated love stories and familial issues, as well as being rejected by society. Both also show a strong friendship between two main characters who are totally the opposite but actually closer than with anyone else, and who can support each others in difficult times. 
Both are about music and finding more about yourself. 
Both series are about music dealing with friendship, rivalry, and love complications. Both series has a josei type of feeling.Both series has drama with complicated storyline.Both series has a great pace of story.Both series contain interesting characters.Both series explores the realism of a love and music.Both series are a must-watch. 
Music theme, drama and a lot of feelings and love "
877,1698,6,"Nana and Nodame Cantabile are similar in that they each weigh heavily on music. Nodame Cantabile has much more comedy, whereas Nana contains more drama, but I'd group them close together in terms of character development and drama enthrallment. 
They are both romantic dramas with some comedy that have to deal with music and deep relationships with others. Both are amazing in my opinion. I highly reccomend both...NANA for the more serious and dramatic and Nodame Cantabile for a little more comedy. 
Both series has josei like artwork and contains music as a major theme.Both series features drama as well as romance presented in a more realistic way. Both series has a similar style that details every day life whether at school or with the band/choir group.  
If you're looking for romance with adult students it may be perfect for u. 
Similar setup as both Josei are slice of life that shows young adults instead of high schoolers, both deals with music, especially for Nodame Cantabile.Nana Komatsu is somewhat similar to Nodame as they are great leads that are optimistic and exceed to share their (usually joyful moods) to the spectator. Both are pretty good comedy at the beginning Nana however has a drastic shift in the middle that turn it into a drama. 
Both are romances with realistic slife of life depiction of the life of young professional musicians building a career. The degree of realism is higher in Nana, and the 2nd half has a tonal shift towards more tragedy drama, while Nodame remains relaxed and easy despite dramatic moments. Both have an ensemble cast of different musician characters with own individuality. Nana is a little rogher, not the least because it features rock musicians, while Nodame takes place on the campus of a classical music college. "
877,4181,4,"Nana is about two girl who have a lot of problems in their life and have to keep struggling, just like Nagisa had to. Both anime made me laugh and cry. The first few episodes of Nana may seem childish or boring, but that's the same problem I had with Clannad, however, in the end, they both became my favourite animes.  
Most people would say there not the same but Both of them have a deep love story behide them and alot of tragedy . both will make you laugh , cry and make you feel connected to them 
Both series are explorations into what it means to be in a relationship and what it takes to make it work amidst the turmoil that is life. They're both quite well developed in their characters and in their faithful portrayal of the ups and downs of love. If you like Nana, you should watch Clannad for the back-story then watch Clannad After Story and enjoy the soul-crushing void that comes with it. If you're in a relationship, or were in one where things didn't exactly go according to plan, or even if they did, you will be able to appreciate both Nana and Clannad After Story for all they have to offer. read more 
Both deal with life and shows the impact of relationships within these incredible stories. "
877,28735,3,"- both series focus on performing arts (music/rakugo)- there's a similar dynamic between main characters (unlikely friends)- lots of realistic drama/relationships - both are aimed at similar demographic (josei) 
Both anime are about unlikely and very strong friendship of two very different people. Both deal with how this friendship interjects protagonists' other relationships and life of professional performer (musician or rakugoka, respective). Finally, both ask fundamentally the same question about this friendship. 
i find both of these shows similar in scope, and mature subject matter. while each have their own stories, i find parallels of fame, relationships, and friendships. nana's driving force is music, and rakugo's being storytelling. so if you dig nana, you might find rakugo enjoyable? or not? but give it a shot. "
877,39533,2,"Both anime have a powerful focus on romance, character development ,drama and music. Also both are fantastic watches and are a nice change of pace from the current popular shows.If you enjoyed one I hope you can give the other a shot.  
I would recommend Nana to anyone who enjoyed Given because they are both music anime and they both include 2 characters with a complex wholesome relationship. The same feelings of the joy of friendship, the complications of life and overall relaxing tone is reflected in both series. In Nana the 2 main characters have a platonic relationship unlike given, however the bond the 2 characters in nana share made me fell the same as a romantic one. Also Nana has superrrr cool outfits and great music too! lots of punk and vivienne  "
877,6114,2,"It may not be the most obvious recommendation but still I find some similarities between Rainbow and Nana. What first got me thinking about it was the background music it sounds pretty much the same, also the art work (some characters from Rainbow do look like some characters from Nana). But ultimatly what I believe is the most resounding similarity between this too is the hoplessness, the despair, the feeling that there are just some things you cannot fix, no matter how hard you try.All in all I believe if you liked Rainbow you will probably like Nana. 
The idea of starting from the bottom to rise to the top is present in both Rainbow, which features inmates of a reformatory striving for success in the real world, and Nana, where Nana Osaki strives to reach mainstream success. The sub-storyline most similar to Nana is that of Yokosuka Joh who has raw musical talent and strives to make it to the top. "
36649,39533,8,"Both about boys (Given is much more direct with their relationships)both have darker tones, not nearly as much as Banana Fish but still doesboth will leave you feeling emotional 
Despite the difference in genre, the wholesome romance/friendship dynamic between a stern, unapproachable character and a more quiet, innocent character is extremely similar. Both anime also feature characters with dark pasts and deal with difficult subjects. If one of these shows leaves you wanting more of the pure romance between two male characters with a backstory of tragic events, I highly recommend the other seeing as it is essentially the focus point of both series’. 
They're feel are very similar they both have very Sad scenes i feel like if you like one you'll love the other . Yes they are two different genres but I cried the same way in both of them even though one left me with a feeling of void the other with hope. Their animations are amazing a well (they both have BL content sooo go for it my fellow fujoshis and fudanshis out there ;)) 
If you want to think about something else than banana fish watch given 
If you watched Banana Fish I think it's fair to say that part of the reason was because of the interesting relationship between Ash and Eiji, I mean come on! We all love a little BL. Given is also a BL title, and though it's not as emotionally painful as Banana Fish, It still has very sad themes. The slow development of Mafuyu and Uenoyama's relationship won't fail to keep you on the edge of your seat. Plus you don't really see a whole lot of band related animes. 
Deals with heavy themes as well, but ultimately very satisfying and heartwarming in the way Banana Fish is as well. Similarly, Given paints the boys as real people, not stereotypes, which is what Banana Fish does so well.  
They both are animes not particularly sad, but emotional, you could be filled with happiness, sadness, confusion or emptiness when you finish either of the animes. They are both very well-made and can make you want to watch for a second time! 
These shows are both subtle shounen-ai. Banana Fish is more Action-Drama while Given is Music-Drama. They’re also both very heartwrenching at times. "
36649,2251,6,"Both of them take place in America and revolve around mafia families and gunfights. Even though Baccano takes a more supernatural approach, they both give off similar mafia vibes. If you enjoyed watching Banana Fish, you should definitely check out Baccano as well. 
Banana fish and Baccano have american characters and show the life and the difficulties people in Mafia have to face. They re both very good. 
These two animes have the same setting, being America and they have tons of guns, killing and violence. Finally they have a small number of episodes. 
Same setting(New York, America) same atmosphere, both have guns and urban action in the cities as the main characters try to solve a mystery related to the past. 
Similar energy & universe : action and danger are proeminant but the tone is light and fun.  
Both are set in the U.S. and focus on topics such as gang violence.  "
36649,19,5,"Though it seems like an odd comparison, both are extremely dark, engage heavily in mystery elements and feel like psychological thrillers. Both have some similar thematic morally grey content and feature characters with dark pasts tied to politically-charged conspiracies tetering on the edge of, or jumping over the edge to, insanity, though incorporates these elements in radically different ways.Monster is a lot more atmospheric and slower paced, Banana Fish is much more character and relationship-driven and fast-paced. Both are among my favorites, however, for similar thematic reasons. 
It might not look like it from the start, but both anime touch pretty deep and dark side of society that doesn't really get much attention in mainstream media these days. Big crimes, corruption, conspiracies, few controlling the many. Mafia buying out police and court, experiments with humans, sexual abuse etc. Whilst Monster is deeper and detective type, Banana Fish is more into gangs and revenge, but they both are for mature audience.  
both anime take a place in a foreign country with a japanese getting involved in a mess f mafia and crimes ,both discuss heavy subjects of experimentation on humanboth anime has a well built up mature story    
Similarities:Dark. Psychological. Thriller. Deep character developments. Characters with dark past and mental problems. Bloody and violent scenes. Mature – I don't know why B.F. is tagged shoujo but it is better suited for mature audience. 
Both are dark, psychological and thriller. Both take place in foreign countries, Banana Fish in the USA and Monster in Germany. Both show a dark side of society. While Monster is slow paced, Banana Fish has a faster pace "
36649,40052,4,"It depends on your choice ""found & lost or got"".Both premises are same. Each MCs meet another country person and their real life changes in various ways.Extremely realistic and psychological thriller. You don't miss both dramatic scenes and some ""truth"".Banana Fish is completely dark and serious. In addition, full of male characters differ from GP.Both are really amazing crime series. If you're a big fan of Banana Fish, you will love GP. Vice versa. 
Both have a blonde man and a japanese man, include mafia stuff, drama, police etc etc ITS SO GOOD 
An innocent Japanese guy gets involved into American gangs/mafia's businessThe story takes place in the US and involves drugs and mature content (like sex trade) 
It has a *slightly* more light-hearted version of Banana Fish's whole vibe. It revolves around con-artists, which is kinda similar to the gangs of Banana FIsh. "

The main character in both anime are the child/in custody of the main villain in each series. The main character in both series hates something to do with drugs. Giorno in Golden Wind hates gangsters who sell drugs to children, while Ash hates Banana Fish, the drug that made his brother crazy. In both series the main character is a blond male teenager who wants to kill the boss of the gang and they were both abused as children. Both anime can also sometimes be violent. read more

36649,1,2,"Can trauma truly be healed? Are there wounds that time cannot cure?Ultimately, Cowboy Bebop and Banana Fish reach the exact same sad conclusion.While surface wise choice of the setting and story are different, on a deeper level both anime deal with the similar topic of trauma. Main character of Cowboy Bebop, Spike, and Ash of Banana Fish are traumatized, and each one has to constantly carry the weight of his past. These are two excellent anime, but no matter how fun it starts in the beginning, - do not kid yourself, - you WILL cry.  
I feel like the main characters, Ash and Spike, are actually quite similar. They both are characters with emotional and traumatic pasts they're trying to run away from but they keep being pulled back into what they're trying to escape from. They both have a similar emotional and character arc, and especially Ash's story about the 'leopard in the snowy mountain' and Spike's story about the 'tiger striped cat' make me feel like fans of one character might really like the other too. "

DN's psychological battle, Banana Fish's action give you strong impact.Character development also decent. Light and Ash are clever killers. They are similar to behavior and personalities.But Ash is still good man and realist. Because of he has important people. Light hasn't those existence.Theme is underworld. Full of dangerous. You need to keep motivation. Otherwise you can't enjoy both of them.Banana Fish is more mature theme. Of course, DN also mature enough.

Both of these shows start off as engaging, gritty crime dramas that pull you in during the first couple of episodes, and carry on through the first half of season with solid character developments. They both feature genius street-smart characters on both sides of their conflicts that approach situations in refreshing ways to the viewer, while still feeling like solid characters from an emotional perspective as well.After the first half, however, both of these shows fall flat in their own ways. Banana Fish declines in quality through its over-integration of too many anime cliches and slapstick humor that conflicts with its previously-established atmosphere; and Death Note through its infamous plot twist that left much of that character development hanging in its final act. read more "

37965,20583,23,"There is a high chance that if you liked Haikyuu you will like Kaze ga Tsuyoku as well. I'm already loving them both! You can feel the similar vibes coming through. The art styles are very similar so characters like Kageyama from Haikyuu and the main character Kakeru from Kaze look very similar. Also there is something going on with the importance of being ""number 10"".So definitely check out one if you have seen the other since they are both Sports genre and by the same studio! 
Both are about sports and friendship ,a little bit of comedy . They have different stories behind the main characters and most of the character have high-spirited about sports. And when they face the challenges too. HAIKYUU is more about doesn't give up and keep working on it. A lot of emotional parts too...you will love it by having goosebumps . After watching this, you might have the feeling of wanted to play or try the sport (if you know me ;) 
Another great sports anime, that focus more on the characters but have the same feeling as haikyuu also really similar art/animation to haikyuu 
Same music artist, which gives the shows the same vibe musically. Overall similar feel, though. Just an uplifting fun venture from beginners to more experienced in their field. It just has the same vibe as Haikyuu. 
Same art style and characters have some similarities as they're from the same studio. However, the difference in the focus in the type of character. Kaze has a Kageyama figure and Sawamura (Daichi) -like captain figure who are the main focus. There is a similar drive by characters to be in the top. Characters get their backstories, development, comic relief. There are rival schools, flaws and growth. Best of all Kaze is a college anime (FINALLY!) and draws on the incredible experience of competition on that higher level. So definitely check out one if you have seen the other!  
Both animes are created by the same studio and have a similar art style and its 'realisticness'. The teams don't necessarily win, but they grow and become a better version of themselves, especially in terms of camaraderie and teamwork. Of course, Run with the Wind is set in university and members have more personal problems like finances and family, most members being amateurs, unlike Haikyuu where the focus is more on volleyball and competition since the members are already passionate. Both are very inspiring. 
If you like either 'Haikyuu!!' or 'Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru', I can almost guarantee you'll enjoy the other. Both are sports anime which have a good balance between the actual sport and character building, as well as humour and angst. Furthermore, both anime have very similar styles of animation if you like either of their aesthetics.The more you watch of either series, the more attached you'll grow to the characters, which have a wide variety of personalities, some of which you'll find similar between the two anime (e.g. Kageyama and Kakeru). In both anime there is a mix of naturally gifted/genius/seasoned characters and others who are rookies, all of whom grow as a team to try and achieve their goal, which others believe to be unrealistic for the teams.Basically, if you want a series which will make you laugh and cry with a team as they struggle to achieve their goal whilst forging friendships and rivalries, I highly recommend both series. It doesn't matter if you're not too interested in either volleyball or running, both these anime will get you worked up and you'll find yourself crossing fingers during the matches/races. read more 
The main characters of both shows are very similar. Both shows are about surpassing one's limits and while Haikyuu!! focuses more on the volleyball itself, Run With The Wind focuses on a lot more of the characters. Both deal with learning to fall in love with the sport. 
Both sports anime. Similar animation style as are by same production company. Similar main characters however, two different perspectives on sport. Both inspirational, dramatic at times, good music and feel good shows. 
Plot* They're both sports animes with a team of multiple main characters, all being boys* Both series use comedy and slice of life to reduce the intensity Music* (the god) Yuuki Hayashi is composing the OST for both series, meaning the music is really similar (and awesome)Art* The series is both made by Production I.G.* Takahiro Chiba is the Chief Animator Director in both animes. Which means they have the same artstyle 
They're two spokon anime, Haikyuu in indeed about volleyball, while Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru is about running. In each one of them the real protagonist is the team and every single member has his own importance in that; they work so hard to gain what they want and eventually they manage to strengthen their bonds.We have some comedy and funny scenes, but the main focus is on matches (Haikyuu) and races (Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru). 
Ride With The Wind was sadly pretty underrated by the anime community. For years, sports anime have been filled with casts who are high school students or younger. Run With The Wind has a cast comprised of people in college. So then why should you watch this anime if you've watched Haikyuu? Other than the obvious factors as being animated by the same studio, Production I.G and having the same composer, Yuki Hayashi. The 2 are similar in that they are both well-crafted and well-animated shows with decent plot. Seriously, just watch it. 
If you like sport shounen like haikyuu, you will also like kaze ga tsuyoku Fuiteiru. Even the art style is similar. Also Kakeru is like the same character as kageyama.  
If you've ever wondered what would be Haikyuu!! like if narrated from Kageyama's perspective (as it was originally planned by the creators!), Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru might give you a fairly good idea.If you're drawn by Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru's characters' developing friendships and personalities, you'll appreciate it in Haikyuu!! as well, and perhaps even more, since Haikyuu!! is about a team sport, which naturally requires lots of interaction between the players. 
Both anime feature protagonists which are similar in character and their passion of their sport, where Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru brings out more personal drama and focuses more on the connections between the members of the track club. 
-Both have similar style of art-The main characters are really funny-The mc's relationship is rocky at first but later develops into them becoming really good friends-Both the main characters are aiming for a large tournamentI strongly urge you to watch it if you liked Haikyuu!! because I loved kaze ga tsuyoku fuiteiru :) 
Another sports anime from the same studio, Production IG. Very character driven with a case of loveable and unique characters, with a similar underdog theme. I can't recommend this anime enough. 
Lets see, this is basically Haikyu but with running. Yuki Hayashi the composer for the killer OST for Haikyu also composed the music here. Both stories focus on a team that basically starts from nothing, oh and the main character looks a lot like someone from Haikyu. Overall to me it had the same vibe, and at some parts they used the EXACT SAME music. If you liked Haikyu you will definitely like run with the wind and vice versa, it is a overall inspiring sports anime. Oh and I guess it helps that the show references Haikyu to. 
Both are very character driven shows that have a wide range of very real and like-able characters that all band together to reach a goal in a given sport. Out of all the sports animes I have watched, Run with the Wind has the most similar vibe to Haikyuu. Run with the Wind is funny, angsty and inspiring, just like Haikyuu is. If you watched all of Haikyuu already, consider giving this anime a chance! I promise you'll enjoy it. Bonus: Kakeru, the main character and Kageyama have very similar character design and both have excellent character development 
This anime is made by the same studio as haikyuu is, its about running. The characters are funny and lovable, and the story is great! Watch out for a direct reference to Haikyuu in later episodes! I highly recommend this for those of you who are haikyuu superfans like me, you wont be disappointed!  
it's a sports anime, but if you like the character development in Haikuu, you'll love this. It focuses more on the character development than the running, but it's also a pretty good representation of running. 
They are both sports anime where the characters bond and grow closer to each other. Also, the plots are well thought out 
I don't do much sport, but you can sort of see the similarities, where they are both teams starting from the bottom and make there way to the top, assuming you've watched the other seasons of 'Haikyuu!!' as well, you can also kind of compare there desire to not give up. "
37965,22135,2,"These shows are both thought-provoking sports anime heavily invested in the themes of natural talent and practice 
Two amazing coming of age stories. Possibly the two best I've seen within the medium of anime. These are both seinen sports anime which include highly emotional moments and even similar climaxes. Both are very rewarding for similar reasons. Excellent character growth and plot progression. Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru is my favorite anime of all time and Ping- Pong is the only anime that I have found similar to it as of the time of this recommendation. "

467,13601,40,"Psycho-Pass is, perhaps, the closest thing to GitS:SAC that we will ever see. This isn't to accuse PP of mindless copycatting, though; although both shows deal with similar settings and subject matter, as well as have similar direction and audiovisual feel, Psycho-Pass clearly holds its own and even improves upon GitS in terms of pacing and visual flair at times. It may not be up to one's taste, but it's definitely worth checking out, and its handling of the subject matter surely deserves credit either way.Important to say, much like its spiritual predecessor, PP also respects the viewer's intelligence to a remarkable degree, offering mostly natural exposition, believable character conflicts and interactions, deus-ex-machina-free plot, and zero fanservice. A rare gem of an anime for a mature viewer. read more 
Both are procedural crime shows and set in a future version of Japan. Both shows are very focused on sci fi and each has their own interesting gallery of gadgets and systems. Both follow the attempts of a law enforcement agencies attempts to capture an enigmatic criminal who's always several steps ahead. Ghost in the Shell is more episodic and the underlying plot is visited in standalone episodes throughout the season. Psycho Pass is more focused on the main plot. I've heard Psycho Pass get called at best inspired by and at worst a rip off of GitS but I think it's its own show and I'll recommend it as such. If you like detective stories, Sci-fi, and character driven drama you'll like this read more 
Not only the futuristic sci-fi crime investigation team premises (heavy on characterisation) but also the series' structure and execution mirror each other. Ghost in the Shell was one of the many works Psycho Pass' creators were open about having influenced them; one even going so far as to say they wanted to surpass GitS. Even the animation studios (Production IG) are the same.The setting of both is 'a future not far away from our reality'. This means our real world logic is applied to series where full-body cybernisation is possible and artificial intelligence can think for itself. To better connect the viewer, both GitS: Stand Alone Complex and Psycho introduce rookie characters that are left somewhat alienated to those around them. GitS: SAC has Togusa be the human element: all of his teammates having undergone some level of cyberisation, while he refuses and relies only on his wits and revolver. Psycho has Akane play a very similar role where she is left aghast over how calm her superior and subordinates are over killing people, just because a number is high and their 'A.I.' controlled guns tell them to shoot.In terms of the plots, aside from the eventual unraveling of CONSPIRACIES, it's the basic structure that links them. Both shows have main plot threads - The Laughing Man in GitS: SAC and Makishima in Psycho - that are briefly touch upon in earlier, episodic content before they become the main focus as the series' draw towards their climatic conclusions. Along the way, the main characters are explored via 'case of the week' stories. The key difference between the two is that Psycho is about a controlled society, reliant on A.I. to do their thinking for them, where latent criminals are used to catch other criminals. GitS: SAC has a team of (mostly) ex-military badarses investigate terrorism, among other things--Japanese society not being very different from how it is in reality.  read more 
Both take place in a similar futuristic setting, where the lines between technology and humanity are blurred. Both are from the point-of-view of law enforcement, showing society through the eyes of those who see the worst of it. 
Both are set in a plausible futuristic setting focused on some police authority. Action scenes litter throughout both series, and when done, they're brilliantly choreographed. Like any two great sci-fi, both looks critically into the social implications of technology, the ethical considerations, and any significant impact of change in lifestyle. Easily two of the best sci-fi anime has to offer, utmost care was put into both in developing a world that feels real and the characters themselves behave accordingly to the circumstances given. 
Both are crime-solving anime in a similar futuristic setting. Both get very serious and give a commentary on the human condition. 
The Ghost in the Shell and Psycho-Pass franchises are both futuristic, cyberpunk police series with a philosophical nature. They take the point of view of the law enforcement in a world where technology and artificial intelligence is much more advanced and has become an integral part in people's daily lives. They often show the worst of such a world, and leave it up to you whether or not that's what's best for mankind.Ghost in the Shell is very character driven while Psycho-Pass focusses more on the main plot, but if you like one the other should definitely interest you aswell. 
First of all in both cases we have the police as the main characters. Secondly we could say the time period is not too distant cyberpunk style future.Psycho - pass seems to have some interesting philosophical views on this kind of future... It's the kind of anime which actually needs you to think when watching it. Ghost in the shell has multiple story arcs, while Psycho Pass has a single arc which connects it all together.  
Both are set in a futuristic society and both talk about psychology and philosophy extensively.    
Gritty police procedural anime from the same studio. They explore the ramifications of their sci-fi settings on the behavior of people, especially criminals. Two very insightful shows that are absolutely beautiful to look at. Psycho-Pass is more about the challenges in creating a utopia, while Stand Alone Complex explores the effects of technology on individuals. 
Both of these story lines fall deep into the future with technology that can better mankind but also still have the same amount of crime. Characters are a bit different than ghost in a shell however you will learn about the characters in this anime at different episodes just like ghost in a shell.  
Both series shares similar themes involving dealing with criminals in a world with powerful technology. In fact, these traces of technology can be traced with cyperpunk themes. Thus, both series has a similar feeling.Both series' characters works with a superior organization to deal with the criminals using their skills. Production I.G. is also involved with both series hence similar animation artwork and visuals. Both series has action, drama, police, and great dialogue usage in many scenes. 
Both anime have a similar feel to their story telling as well as both being worlds in a not too distant future. Both can also be classified as science fiction and each follow a form of law enforcement. 
Both animes feature an advanced technological society that despite the cutting edge technology suffers from both existential and criminal issues. Both animes feature cybercrime and a lot of action. Both animes focus on police and investigations. 
Aside from being masterpieces of the psychological genre, both series are set in a cyberpunk world and include plenty of thought-provoking philosophical moments and exhilarating action to keep you at the edge of your seat, especially in the later episodes.In short, what truly sets either of these series above the average anime and makes the other absolutely worth watching if you wholeheartedly enjoyed one, is how there is neither black nor white characterization and character morals, in addition to unpredictable plot direction... By the end of the series (particularly in Psycho-Pass imo) you may end up rooting for what you (as the viewer) believe is the best course of action for the respective content's humanity, as opposed to what is ""justice"" or some commonly accepted ideology. Find out for yourself; enjoy! read more 
The atmosphere is very similar, with mature and complex characters, in these two series there is room for both, action and philosophy. 
Both are in the future, have to deal in a sci-fi genre and deal with aspects of philosophy. Specifically, they deal with the philosophy of current life and future life. Both also have great, almost similar artwork (minus characters). 
They're both set in futuristic/cyberpunk type worlds (although PP seems a few decades behind GITS technology-wise) and focus on law enforcement, while also delving into themes like grey morality. The main difference is in the main theme; where GITS focuses on the idea of individualism in an increasingly connected world, PP chooses to explore the idea of freedom vs security. If you liked one it's a high chance you'll like the other. 
Both of these anime are set in the future and deal with law enforcement. Ghost in the Shell revolves more around how we are losing our grip on humanity compared to how horrifying humanity is in the future with Psycho Pass. Both of these anime also have underlying meanings that really strike a chord when they are finally understood. 
Both are about police investigation. They both set up in a sci-fi world. They both have a strong squad that each member have his speciality. 
Great world building for future crime fighting, integrating future technologies into society. This creates a utopia/dystopia in both worlds. Questions arise about how technologies should be used and how society should be governed to regulate such abuse or misuse. (more pronounced in Psycho Pass)Both have strong female MCs (GITS a little stronger) and an interactive unit/team to introduce interesting characters and dialogue/ideology. (PP is stronger in character development, GITS in dialogue)  
There are some major parallels to draw between the two shows. Both feature a team of police detectives in a near future world, hunting down criminals, often of a cyber nature. They do this using futuristic technology, which feels pretty similar between the two shows. The action scenes in both shows also manages to feel pretty similar.There's two major differences between the shows. First, the story setup is different. Psyco-Pass being focused around measuring a person's criminal tendencies, while GitS: S.A.C is focused around equal rights for androids, and explores if androids are able to have souls and feel emotions.The second big difference would be the art style, which ends up being more realistic in GitS, and slightly more stylized in Psycho-Pass. read more 
If You liked one, then you will definitely like the other. Both these anime's take place in a future society that have advanced technological marvels that can satisfy the most hard core of sci-fi fans. Both anime's are suited for a more mature audience and depict police procedurals in a similar fashion.Ghost in the shell is more action packed or at least the action is on a different scale, while Psycho-pass is more philosophical about society, not that SAC doesn't do the same in it's own way.Bottom line is both of these anime's give off a very similar vibe and they they were intact made by the same company, but only about a decade apart. read more 
Both of them are masterpieces of the Sci-Fi genre.Both of them revolve around agencies that deal with criminals in complex and mostly dystopian futures.Both of them are incredibly well written, the characters have a lot of depth to them, the settings they take place in are so vividly detailed and fascinating that they make you wish you could be part of such a future.They are both some of the best produced anime out there.Psycho-Pass obviously takes a lot of inspiration from Ghost in The Shell, but both Psycho-Pass and Ghost in the Shell have distinct voices and they are in no way the same thing.Both of them have memorable soundtracks.Both of them are action packed, filled with thought provoking moments, psychological thrill rides and excitement or despair lurks at every corner. read more 
Its easy to see how Psycho-Pass was inspired by Ghost in the Shell (1st Season)OB; objective similarities SUB; based on my personal experience.-Similar in the world-building; both shows have a cyber-society dominated by technology . (OB)-Presentation of the Police cyber-crime exists in both shows, a criminal that uses cyber technology in a stand-alone episodes, that is not part of the main arc. (OB)-Both shows have a special team (division) to deal with such crimes (OB)-Minor Spoiler BEWARE --------- there is a corrupt political operating system in both shows. (OB)-Both shows have a main villain (cat-mouse type). (OB)-The use of technology however is more logical in Ghost in the Shell (SUB)-More realistic turn of events and more focus on politics in ghost in the shell than psycho-pass. (SUB)-Similar villains but Psycho-pass villain has more screen time and is more interesting. (SUB)-More focus on the main arc in Psycho-Pass than GitS (OB)I Hope this was useful. read more 
They are both made by Production IG.They are both cyberpunk police showsThe main character is female in both series (Tsunemori Akane for Psycho-Pass and Kusanagi  for GITS)They are both very philosofical and psychological 
Both are set in cyber world's that rely on machines in some way or another. I believe Psycho Pass is heavily inspired by GITS as well and in some ways a more modern, less complicated variation to the classic series. 
- Both deal with a futuristic society.- Both have similar motifs.- Both are cyberized.- Both have action for engagement.- Both deal with a stand alone complex in some sort of way. 
When it comes cyberpunk settings anime, these two are a must watch. Futuristic police and government action, not to forget the fact that both anime franchises were created by Production I.G. Both series have female lead characters, something you don't come across a lot in anime.  
GiTS: SAC and Psycho-Pass are similar Police, Drama and Psychological shows, which deal with some of the same themes. Both shows have the same pacing and only go out of hand at the end of the story. 
Both focus on a story set in the future and revolve around solving crimes commited. Both deal with very realistic conflicts and believable characters that keep you gripped from the beginning of the show till the very end. The paces of both are a little different but otherwise they share quite a few similarities. Psycho Pass is probably the closest thing in anime to GitS. 
Both are set in a futuristic setting and aired with the same studio. They both deal with philosophies and have a very similar feel to storytelling.  
Futuristic worlds where the advanced technology should be supposed to protect us from all evil and create perfect societies, but the reality isn't always that simple. Corruption lurks in every corner and a villain/master-mind appears in an attempt to deliver his own justice.That's where the special investigation teams come up. Consisting of a bunch of agents with open mindsets and different levels of experience dealing with crimes have their ideology tested to prevent the villain's actions.While solving multiple small cases leading to the master-mind, both teams get a step closer to uncovering the truth. However, the case is not as simple as capturing a bad guy.Basically, you will get a similar type of investigation-centered anime with tons of action and some deep dialogs/questions that will amuse you and maybe create some empathy with the villain's ideology. read more 
Both Psycho Pass and GiTS SAC are brilliant action and police anime with a specific focus on law and order and exploring the morality and efficiency of the systems of justice set in place. Anyone who adores well-written police/psychological and cyberpunk anime should watch both Psycho Pass and GiTS. 
Similar cyberpunk setting, brings up themes of society and other philosophical questions 
Both take place in a cyberpunk dystopian Japan and follow a special police task force’s activities. Each episode, the characters responded to different incidents that end up being interrelated with each other. I can’t really say too much more without spoilers. 
These two series are police orientated with a group of characters solving mysteries and kicking ass.Both of these series concentrate on philosophical questions that make you really use your mind to connect things together and goes on about what it truly means to be human   
Psycho-Pass borrows very heavily from Ghost in the Shell SAC's structure, in which police forces in futuristic cyberpunk worlds deal with new forms of crime committed using technology that interacts with the human brain, and their members must come to terms with their roles in this conflict. 
Aired by the same producers, has the same future feel. Both aren't afraid to experiment with something. Of course, SAC is an absolute classic. 
Both are from future, about problems in society.  "
467,1,9,"Futuristic animes that have characters who are Kick Ass! The main characters in both animes, the Major for GITS and Spike for Bebop, both have strong convictions and an unknown past that fuels their character's values.  
Sci-fi anime set in the near future that focus on criminal investigation (bounty hunters/cyber crime police). Both are filled with back to back episodes of intense action driven by a wonderfully jazzy soundtrack composed by Yoko Kanno. 
Amazingly crafted sci-fi future settings, conveyed through episodic crime drama. Both shows develop their characters through a series of self-contained sequences, while also having elements of an overarching plot, and ending the series with a focus that plot. If you are looking for a series that can be both episodic and sharply reflective on its characters, these two are the way to go. Should also be mentioned that lauded composer Yoko Kanno made the OST for both. 
First, both anime have a lot of sci-fi stuff in them, but one thing that really makes them similar is how in both anime, the main characters are always trying to catch some criminal. Of course, in Ghost in the Shell the main characters are cops while in Cowboy Bebop the main characters are bounty hunters which does make the anime a little different. Ghost in the Shell's story is much more complex, while Cowboy Bebop is more free and wild. However, both are petty serious anime, except there are a lot of times that I laughed while watching Cowboy Bebop. They also both have lots of actions scenes of people shooting each other. Also, in Cowboy Bebop, I think I related to the characters more, but in both anime all the characters still have this unstoppable pursuit to catch their target. read more 
Both are heavy on the characters, specifically a group of people banded together seemingly for work only, but who become friends in the process. An overwhelming majority of the episodes is action-packed, with some being a part of a greater storyline and some - individual stories. Although the setting is completely different, they give off similar vibes and rely on akin formulas. 
Both shows are mostly episodic sci-fi shows with heavily character driven stories that play on the complexities of their own sci-fi world while retaining a certain level of relatability to the viewer. Ghost in the Shell SAC does a slightly better job at world building and  features more engaging and and philosophical stories than Bebop but this is obviously subjective. Both shows also feature well choreographed fight scenes and kick-ass sound tracks by Yoko Kanno. 
These anime share a similar plot structure: we have a different case/adventure in most of the episodes while still retaining a background main plot. Throughout the story we learn more about each MC personality and past. If you like futuristic action and some mature themes, you got here two anime perfect for you. The crew in Cowboy Bebop is more of a 'bandit crew' while the crew in GitS is an investigation team and everything would point that they are opposite poles but they actually share many similarities. Just take in mind the settings and world are quite different. 
Both are episodic cyber-noir series with soundtracks composed by Yoko Kanno running 26 episodes.  Both series feature the protagonists confronting memorable and unique criminals each episode, and both have excellent dubs.  Both series also heavily feature gun-play. 
Both shows are believable visions of crime in the future; Cowboy Bebop is about bounty hunters, while Ghost in the Shell is a cop show. They are both mostly episodic but some episodes are tied together by an ongoing plot that reveals some characters' backstories. They both also have excellent art, animation, and music. "
467,1535,3,"Dig out your sleuth hats. Both series follow a plot that is very challenging to figure out. While Ghost in the Shell has a greater focus on action, Death Note and GitS share the ability to baffle with plot twists and complex schemes. 
Both series' stories involve very deep, intellectual concepts and the plot twists, in particular, are amazing.  While GitS has far more filler than Death Note, both series almost always focus on crime and/or the psychology and rationale of the people who drive the stories forward.  Also, they both have absolutely stunning art styles. 
Both have the same psychological roller-coaster of a cat and mice chase. "
467,19,3,"Both shows have really prominent elements of mystery and suspense which keep audiences actively watching and on the edge of their seats! Though one is obviously futuristic and the other set a few decades in the past they share a common allure due to the fact that they're so exciting and intriguing and they keep us guessing at things. They also both include a lot of ethical dilemmas. Generally, they're both just really awesome... :) 
Both stories have short side stories, which are influencing the flow of the story and after a time the connection between everything gets clearer. The antagonist is in both stories very mysterious and the goals are unclear, they also have in common, that they are connected to each sidestory. 
The animation style is the same. The same psychological roller-coaster is given to the viewer. "

Not only have these two set out the pinnacle and future potential of anime, but the influence they gave on future entertainment...Both share a plot with lots of politics, crime, war, etc. involved, as well as mature and philosophical themes. While both are military-esque, these two have different approaches. LoGH involves a lot more tactical warfare, as well as it being set in space. Ghost in the Shell deals with cyber warfare and is a bit more grounded in realism, despite having mechs (tachikomas) and cybernetics involved. By the end of these two anime, you will practically remember [almost] every character you come across in these two series. read more

35851,12355,21,"This is the top recommendation already, but the themes and emotions in these two movies are both really raw and similar. Single mothers raising children that are of a different species, dealing with the problems that arise because of these circumstance, and loving their children unconditionally. Both movies made me cry, though Maquia had me in tears since minute 10 til the end of the movie. They are really heart-wrenching movies, and as a girl who immigrated to America and lost a lot of familial bonds, I cried a little extra. The pure maternal love in these movies make me choke up every time. Really recommend them.  read more 
Motherhood: the movie. These are two stories of single mothers raising a child/children by themselves. They are some of the best examples of true motherly love, and really hit at that emotional core in many ways. They show the sacrifices required to raise children, and both the good and bad that can come with that. If you want something to lift your spirits, likely through tears, these two are easy to recommend.  
Those are movies about a single mom raising a child from a different species. In the case of Ookami Kodomo, the protagonist raises her two half-wolves kids; in the case of Maquia, the protagonist raises a human boy as if he was her own child. Those are one of the few anime I've ever seen that focus on how hard it is to be a single mom. Both are great movies, and will surely make you cry. 
- A story about mother.- Hana is a breeder , Maquia not. Both are lovely mother to have, though. And to watch ofc.- Two rebellious kids v. one mother-complex kid. Choose your poison wisely, mom.- Beautiful world. Personally, i like the kindgom-esque world in Maquia more than the humble village-esque world of Ookami Komodo.- There will be tears. Trust me. 
Both are films about motherhood, under unusual (that is to say supernatural) circumstances, that will likely make you cry.Despite their fantastical setting, they focus on the hardships of life, relationships, and how people change and grow. 
Both are very beautiful films. They make me cry T ^ T. Similarity:-About single parents-Show how mothers care for their children grow patiently- A BROKEN HEART MOVIE T^T 
need something that wants to test how tough your heart and emotions are? I will give thisP.S : this is an anime movie, so it doesn't take long time to watch it. 
Both have similar themes.Both will make you cry. 
SPOILER ALERT FOR MAQUIAMaquia and Wolf Children both deal with the hardships, struggle, love and care through the fantasy genre of mothership and maternal love. Where as Wolf Children's conflict comes through Hana having to raise 2 impossible children who possess both human and wolf traits, Maquia shows the relationship between an immortal girl raising a child who is inherently not her own. Both seem almost majestic by showing what is essentially at its core a grounded and heart felt relationship between mother and children, with the struggles of growing up, yet also being set in a believable fantasy world. If you love Wolf Children, or want a realistic fantasy to cry at again, you owe it to yourself to see Maquia. read more 
Exploring the themes of motherhood integrated into beautiful fantasy settings. The focus on parenting is more prominent in Wolf Children, with Maquia expending more time and effort to develop its world. Both are dazzling and dramatic experiences to behold, ambitiously attempting to weave tales covering large time spans within just a few hours. 
-Both of these movies made me call up my mum and just say ""I love you so much and thank you so much for looking after me and loving me <3""-They are heart-warming and beautiful and twine together all the emotions felt by the viewers seamlessly-TELL YOUR MOM THAT YOU LOVE HER ! 
Both are hearthwarming portrays of a mother raising her child through adversity 
Wow, both will have Cat's In The Cradle playing in the background as you watch them.Apart from being blatant pro-natal propaganda, both shows take a huge risk that other producers avoid like the plague - talkin abt MOTHERHOOD.In case you didn't know, its one of the hardest jobs in the world and both movies prove that in their own way - by chopping onions on the down low. Still, the only thing you have to remember is CALL YOUR MOM AND TELL HER YOU LOVE HER DAMMIT!!! 
I think the biggest similarity between these two movies is that they’re parent-oriented tear jerkers. If you’re looking for a grogeous movie to sob to, look no further. The lead in both is a single mom trying her darn best for her kid (s). Sayonara is a fantasy based worl that includes dragons, mythical races, kings and warring kingdoms, while wolf children focuses on a modern Japanese setting. There’s strong character growth through both, which includes the children and the parents. You’ll cry for both, so get the tissues ready. 
Both tackle the same topic which is raising a family. Although that both have fantasy, Wolf children is more connected to the modern era. They have a similar narrative with the use of timeskips, and in my opinion they were better used in WC. If you enjoyed one of them, I highly recommend the other 
It's no easy task to become a good parent, especially being a single parent, Wolf Children and Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms are specialists in this situation. Even with the vast difference in race, even with the abnormalities and troubles that can be brought to the family due to society. Mothers Maquia and Hana both create a family far from a standard human one, in which, both protagonists go through a process of learning normal life skills via raising children. Both characters also have a nice smile to keep up.Both are great works for the fantasy genre about family, though Promised Flower is for those who love drama, Wolf Children for those who look for more s.o.l read more 
It would be hard to find two movies more similar than these two. They both feature:- single mothers raising a child of a different species,- themes about your children growing up and you having to let them go,- lots of emotional moments to cry at,- and a beautiful fantasy setting. 
They are both movies about a mother's struggles of raising their children and family life. 
The protagonists of both movies are extremely similar, in a sense of having a child yet not knowing on what and how to deal with it. Teaching a valuable lesson in life that might help in real life situations if the same issue/s were encountered.

35851,33352,8,"These are both stories of love and loss, and give off the same warm feeling (coated with a splash of darkness). Both main characters are trying to discover what love is (in various ways), and trying to find their place in a world that doesn't really want them around. The art in both is fantastic, as is the music. Characters are also fleshed out and enjoyable. Bring tissues, these are two emotional roller-coasters you won't want to skip. 
- Both give similar feelings and bring alike atmosphere. - Both will probably make you cry. - Protagonists don't fit in society due to being different from most people, and animes focus a lot on their personal development. - Kind bittersweet story. - Both main heroines are blond, duh.  
Both main characters are detached from the norms of society due to their past upbringings, and go through quite a bit of characterization and development as their respective story progresses. In both cases, they were bittersweet and show the hardships and realities of life, even in fantastical settings (though Sayonara no Asa is more supernatural/magical by nature).Both shows' animation are among the best in the recent years, and arguably ahead of their time. 
Both anime have similar bitter-sweet atmosphere, telling a story of girls who doesn't fit into society and how they learn about the world as well as how to overcome obstacles on their way. Both tales are very emotional and more likely will make you cry at some point.  
There is a very simile feel between these two. They both have female mane characters and have a bitter sweat story about people struggling with there emotions and coming to grips with what has happened in there past. Also the artwork in both these show is amazing, the overall feel of the show is smiler as well despite the fact that violet evergarden is light fantasy at best. 
Both SayoAsa and Violet are linked to one thing: character development as an important narrative element. This is the reason to watch, you want to see the characters being alive in the work. 
Conflict is bad. But with its destruction it brings, the aftermath that comes after it can sure change one's life forever long. This is true for both Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms and Violet Evergarden.Both heroines Violet and Maquia suffered from confliction between two different groups, only to distance away from the troubles and live a new life finding meaning in what should be an obvious answer to a simple question. That is, being a mother in Promised Flower, and what ""I love you"" means in VE.Both are great visual masterpieces filled with heartfelt emotions and amazing soundtracks to accompany it.

All the emotions. Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms and A Silent Voice both follow stories that give a heartfelt story full of people going through ups and downs one would normally have in an iffy relationship.Promised Flower has a relationship between an Iorph and human. Silent Voice is between a former bully and a deaf girl (who bullied by the former bully).Both are great visual masterpieces that you can expect to be filled with the happiest of times and saddest, though Silent Voice is more depressing than Promised Flower. 
If you cried with this movie then you'll cry with this. I believe that A silent voice wraps it up more then Sayonara no Asa ni Yakusoku no Hana wo Kazarou. You'll get all the backstory and character development you'll ever want here.  "

35851,4181,2,"Raising a child is difficult. Stories Clannad After Story and Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms present this all too well. Hardships, a past of darkness, corrupted values influence these families all too much.Clannad's struggling Tomoya endures the pain of what possibilities can await an adult. Promised Flower's Iorph Maquia also endures this pain as well as the differences in races in who she is raising.Both are great anime with the same emotional ups and downs parents and children can feel alike. 
Both revolve around that family aspect and is a great movie to watch for a good cry. A big difference is the setting though since this movie is more fantasy. NOTICE: the first time I watched it was slow in the beginning but it gets better and the ending left me with a happy yet bittersweet and lonely feeling.  "

31646,23273,52,"Very similar main characters, facing similar complex and personal problems, in a similar isolated setting, similar messages... I could go on. Enjoy! 
the anime tells a story of a young boy striving towards his goal of being a professional in their own respective field while simultaneously facing other problems in their daily lives. while solving their inner problems, they get stronger and eventually reach their goal (hopefully).graphics-wise, both anime has a similar style. it can be gloomy in times and bright the other. the main character is a boy wearing glasses with a blonde older sister-type support female character. 
both feature young child prodigies with an extreme talent: chess and music. Both are about more than just that talent, as the characters deal with underlying issues within themselves and their relationships with others. 
Both of these anime delve into a deep psychological trauma. Both MCs are known as child prodigies and it is due to a need to avert their eyes to reality. They are both complex stories that touch upon the heart strings with topics of depression and self-acceptance. 
Story of a boy who climbs to the top of his profession. Through with that, he is bounded by a wall created from dark past. 
I can't help but to think about Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso when watching 3-gatsu no Lion.Similar titles aside, both feature the same premise; a prodigy young man's struggles to cope with the depression of losing a loved one. Both series feature a prodigy MC (Rei and Kousei) who are similar in looks and personalities and female figures (Kaori and the Kawamoto siblings) who came inside the MC's life and help them overcome their depression. The MCs also gains many rivals and friends throughout their journey in their career.Even though I found 3-gatsu's tone more consistent and its comedy less forced than Shigatsu, I enjoyed both works and guarantee if you enjoy one of them you'll enjoy the other due to their similarities. read more 
A prodigy with an existential crisis. A lot of gloominess and not strong enough comic relief to wipe it away. 
3-gatsu no Lion and Your lie in April both have a main protagonist who suffers from a depression. They also are good in playing the piano. While the one is more romance oriented and the other slice-of-life, they both share the story of how the protagonist overcomes his depression. 
Main character who has a painful past, who excels in a field (Arima on the piano and Rei at the shogi). He also has many uncertainties about his future and lack of self-confidence.Warm characters around the main character; (Hina, Momo, Akari in 3-Gatsu no Lion and Kaori, Tsubaki in Shigatsu)A wonderful animation with a visual identity for both. (The two animes look slightly alike) 
Both animes are quite , about feels and talents and independence both animes have the main character who is shy , wearing glasses both heroines are blonde , and they look like each otherboth main characters have suffered their parent's death and trying to live independently  
Both shows have a lot in common. They both tell stories of a main character who is a child prodigy and struggling to maintain their title. Their struggles are represented in a similar style and narrative, and yet the overall story is different, so it doesn't feel like you're watching the same show twice. In fact I would go so far as to say March Comes in Like a Lion surpasses Your Lie in April in many ways.TL;DR: If you enjoyed watching Kousei overcoming his past and learning to love life, this show is for you. 
If you're watching this because title similliarity, than you're not watching the wrong show.Both MC has similliar problems, and each anime has their own style of art. 
Similar Art styles 
Both protagonists share a dark past and a remarkable skill. The monologues in each of them often have deep metaphors for life. Introspection, retrospection, and dealing with losses/mourning all are resonating themes in these two.  
Both protagonists struggle living their lives due to their treacherous pasts. They both have people help them develop into becoming better people.Both of the protagonists are proficient in what they play, Rei to Shogi as Arima is to piano.Similar artstyle.Both protagonists have glasses (I ran out of comparisons lol) 
Both feature a protagonist who is struggling with depression because of the death of his loved ones and both main characters have a complicated relationship with their passions (Shigatsu has music, 3-gatsu has shogi), but these passions are not the main focus of the shows. Also, both protagonists meet people who change their lives for the better. They have similar color pallets and realistic characters.March Comes in Like a Lion has more unique visuals and better direction than Your Lie in April due to the very different animation studios and directors. Also YLIA has way more romance (3-gatsu being more of a slice-of-life series), but anyone can feel the similarities while watching one after having seen the other. Both are touching dramas that serves as a memorable experience for fans of the genre. read more 
Both of these series feel similar in their directing and animation styles.While Your Lie in April focuses more on romantic relations, March Comes in Like a Lion focuses more on familial/platonic relations. Both are sure to hit ya right in the kokoro. 
Not only the titles look-a-like, but the feeling you get when watching is fairly similar. Main characters have only one thing they are good and his friends (and other side-characters) will help him get back on his feet. The scenes vary from funny to death serious which makes it very appealing to keep on watching. So If you liked ""Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso"", ""Sangatsu no Lion"" will not disappoint you. 
Both protagonists look like they could be brothers and they have a very similar personality. They both deal with depression and loneliness, but are also gifted with a special talent in their field. Both series have an unique color palette and look very good.  
The main characters are both struggling with depression, they're both genius and can't give up on it. They are both drama/slice of life anime with beautiful unique soundtrack and animations. The plot of the stories revolve around the main character struggle and them learning things from their mistakes and experiences.  
The Art Style is Similar. Both Protagonist are talented, they also look alike with glasses, Both Lacks Confidence and depressed. It also gives you The Your Lie In April Vibes 
A talented prodigy who feels as though they've got nothing else (and also happen to look kinda similar) the stories are pretty different, but they give off a similar vibe - and anyone who loves the first, will definitely love the other - at least, I certainly did! They're emotionally deep, are astonishingly beautiful to watch and will leave a whole in your heart you won't be able to forget. About dealing with past trauma, and the journey to self discovery and finding a way to wake up from that half-life depression. Honestly, they are instant gems, masterpieces, unbelievably refreshing and unique but with unbelievable parallels.Truly, you're missing out if you pass either one up after seeing the first! read more 
Both of the main characters have only 1 thing that they do exceptionally well and want but can't separate it from their lives. 
I find these shows both similar not in the aspect of plot but in character. Both mains, Kousei from Your Lie in April, and Rei from March Comes in Like A Lion both share similar character as they have both had traumatic past life events. This prompts them to be somewhat timid and silent but have thoughts encircling their minds at all times. On top of that, they are both young prodigies in a competitive field (Piano and Shogi respectively). Finally, they share a somewhat similar appearance with glasses, messy black hair, and an always  wavering mouth.Another thing noted is the animation. I find a large resemblance in the styles, especially on the character designs. read more 
Both MCs have mental and social problems due to losing their family member(s). And some characters help them get out of those problems.No ecchi.Both are anime with competition in it.Both arts and musics have the same vibes.EVEN THEIR TITLES HAVE ""GATSU"" IN THEM. 
Both of these series focus on characters who are dealing with depression and the loss of loved ones. Both also follow their character's chosen profession and how they handle these careers at young ages. I recommend this to those who are interested in stories about depression, loss, and perseverance.  
I do think the MCs are very similar and overall they have the same tone to them. 
Both main characters have a special talent (Kousei piano and rei shogi)they both walk through life with the past constantly biting them and both are quite emotional. 
Both the protagonists share some aspects in their lifes, like the absence of their families and confront their past to keep moving on 
The vibe of the two anime are very similar. 
Both of these anime are both similiar and different in a lor of their aspects. Both of these series have a talented teenager as a main character that are good at what they do( shogi and Piano). Both these characters deal with tragic events that had happened in the past. Both these characters seek outside help from people they hardly know for support and both these shows get you right in the feels. They have a competitve aspect too.They're a lot different too! 
Both series' deal with a MC who struggles with personal problems as a result of a loss of family, to which it is through the relationship with the center female (3 in 3-gatsu) that the main character starts to break from his shell 
the main character Arima, kousei is so much like Rei  in how they both see the half empty part of the glass .. how they both feel lonely without  piano - in case of arima - and shogi -in case of Rei -, and how the few people around them make the the biggest effect with the least action the make towards them.both are one of my favorite slice of life animesand if you happen to like one of them, you got to watch the other cause surely you'll like it,too enjoy it :D 
Both series feature protagonists who are young prodigies, who are struggling to overcome depression and a traumatic upbringing. 
Both shows feature a main character who suffers from this inherent, inescapable guilt which they work tirelessly to overcome. Both main characters also look very similar and have a lot of similar character traits in general (even when excluding their main difficulties they face plot-wise). Shigatsu is shorter, but Sangatsu is a true masterpiece. Anyone who enjoyed Shigatsu or who cried should give both seasons of Sangatsu a try, ESPECIALLY season 2 as it is far superior (which is hard to do given that season 1 is already perfection). 
Both Main Characters are almost 100% Similar in their downtrodden Characteristics and their Genious attribute in their own places.Arima is a Piano Genius who has difficulties playing it due to his unrivaled skills and past circumstances.Rei is a Shogi master who has been a Shogi monster but his step sister and brother had pushed him away thus he think that his skills of Shogi is nothing but a Necessary Evil for him.Both hate their Genius abilities but they can't live without Piano/ShogiBoth were kindled by the people and friends around them 
-Both the male MCs are eerily similar, both physically as well as with their past.-As time passes, they both slowly open up and start mending the cracks by forming beautiful relationships with those around them.-Both series capture emotions of the viewer and twine them together as the story progresses. 
Why they should be similar, were you thinking, right?Well, to start both told a story about a shy, confused and little coward boy, who tries to overcame his fears and anxiety. As the story moves on we will see our main character grow, evolve, we’ll see him smile and cry, how he’ll interact with his surrondings and what kind of relationship will born with the other characters; because personally, i believe, that these last ones are the most important and fascinating.I will be straightforward with you, both of them have quite the strong emotional impact, on which i reflected a lot. Both of the stories deal with strong, difficult and heavy themes, things that maybe not everyone have desire do deal with, but i still want to invite you, at least, to try to watch and not discard them immediately.To conclude, i hope i have motivated at least some of you, the only things i can add are that there are some of the best scenary that i remember, the musics are fantastic and there si an extraordinary characters personalization.Thanks for reading this far and goodbye. read more 
Both have similar sort of atmosphere and slice of life story telling involving the mc actually developing and making better relation with other people.  
2 stories about 2 geniuses struggling to overcome their loss in the past, and how they were saved by the people around them. 
- The main characters both deal with trying to find themselves due to their pasts- Both are conveyed in very similar ways- Both have characters where they help them discover themselves- Both are touching, however Your Lie in April is sadder 
A story about getting over the past, which is a reoccurring theme in both series. Both protagonist are naturally gifted and talented, however because of it they are both haunted by the past. Kiriyama suffers from discrimination, while Arima lost his abilities to hear himself. They are both great masterpiece series out of their own perspective series. 
Both the MCs are alike and both anime deal with their problems and I think if you have watched either of them you will like the other. 
They are both stories of despair and passion. The main protagonists have something traumatic happen to them, and this despair begins to overtake and hide their passions 
These slow-burn, drama-heavy anime will keep you coming back for more. Plus, both the main character of each show, Kiriyama of Sangatsu no Lion and Kousei of Your Lie in April look like they could be brothers. While watching Sangatsu no Lion, I couldn't help but be reminded of Your Lie in April. 
Both have the same melancholic, romantic, sad ambience and atmosphere. Really peaceful but a lot of inner turmoil. Both had me crying :( 
March comes in like a lion and Your Lie in April are both amazing dramas following an introverted kid with a huge passion and talent in a certain activity. Both of these shows also both have a similar art style which may not be beautiful on their own, but they fit their respective anime all too well. And finally I need to mention that both of these anime are extremely sad, which is to be expected from dramas, but in my opinion the sadness factor in both of these anime is WAY above average. 
Both deal with lots of character development and backstories for each one. goes in-depth to smaller characters and tells their backstory. 
slow paced and have VERY similar premises. 
Both of the main characters lack color and depth within their world. They are now failing at the sports that they were amazing at and both suffer from depression due to lack of family and friends in their world. However, both meet people that manage to bring color back into their world. Sangatsu, overall, does a better job at this than Shigatsu and manages to show amazing scenes along with the struggles that side characters often go through as well. Thus, if you like Shigatsu, consider Sangatsu. 
Both are very slow-paced slice-of-life drama-oriented animes, with a troubled-minded main-character boy (looking almost alike).Your lie in april (Shigatsu wa kimi no uso) focuses on classical music, while 3-gatsu no Lion involves a Japanese board-game (shogi). 
Extremely similar to each other, both serving many parallels that can be identified with the other. Both feature a main character with past trauma involving their respective professions (Pianist, Shogi Player) who gradually develop themselves due to the influence of others. If you are looking for something like Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, this is your go-to series. "
31646,4081,15,"deals a lot with depression and opening your heart to others. both are very good at changing your feelings with the mood it sets. some scenes can feel cold and distant, while others feel warm and welcoming. they're overall fluffy, feel good shows. both protagonists are quiet, antisocial, and not good at expressing themselves. both are also frequently taken care of by kind people who are not blood-relatives.    
A mellow athmosphere with character relations as the main focus. 
- Main characters are presented as precocious children who are initially withdrawn from society due to circumstances.- Story is nonlinear and series is broken up into short stories. Mainly seem to be coming of age stories of protagonists slowly coming out of their shell.- Shows make viewers want to protect their sweet cinnamon rolls. 
Both are slice of life shows about boys dealing with isolation and depression who learn to open up, depend on others, and be happy. Both are very touching with beautiful character development. Rei and Natsume are similar character archetypes, and if you enjoy either show for the main character, you'll definitely like the other show. 
Both the MC's of respective shows are a lot alike, they both close and choose to restrain themselves at first but as they meet people, the barrier they initially put erodes and show another side of themselves.  
The great point is the personal rhythm of the anime series, with a great visual style where the characters evolve how humans, with feelings and discover the world of the friends and family, but always supported on an element that marks his life. 
Although Natsume Yuujinchou is a fantasy slice of life with supernatural yokais and 3-gatsu no Lion is about shogi, they have similar themes in overcoming struggles, depression etc. They have similar vibes and look good and unique. 
Both about introverted high schoolers, whose parents died when they were young, dealing with their own issues and slowly coming out of their shell with the help of other people and sometimes, in the case of Natsume, yokai. 
Both main characters have an extremely difficult time accepting affection and tend to be extremely cautious with opening their hearts. 
Nice, slow pace. Lots of sad stories, but has a bitter-sweet feeling that lingers and warms your soul. Great anime, great music and great characters too. 
we can sense the same warm and sad feeling from them plus the background music is really support that feeling. the characters face same difficulties of being alone and for the first time finding the meaning of love from friends etc, 
-Both the MCs have somewhat of a sad past, but slowly break out of those shells by forming close bonds with people around them.-They both learn to trust the people around them, while also learning lessons from those that mean harm to them as well.-Both series revolve greatly around SoL and emotions. 
Both are heartwarming slice of life dramas that have kind but troubled protagonists learning to rely on others and open up about themselves.  If you take the youkai and fantasy elements out of Natsume Yuujinchou you would have Sangatsu no lion at its core.  The supporting casts for both shows are fantastic, and the art and soundtracks are beautiful.  Please give both shows a watch!   
Similarities:- Both MC parents are not alive anymore and both have to live with other people- Both MC felt out of place- Both have bittersweet past- Both are ""saved"" by another family 
the characters both are melancholic, deals with healing and found family. sad orphan boys :( "
31646,28735,10,"Both series are about people who are passionate and talented in a specific thing (rakugo performance and shogi), and both give a very in-depth look as to the complicated feelings you can have toward something you dedicate your life to. Both have excellent character drama, writing, art, and directing.  
Both are stories  about protagonists pursuing success in the only thing they have to fill the void inside while coping with the isolation and loneliness that comes with it. Hurting people  close to them and trying to fix the mistakes are dealt with in both anime albeit in different ways. And even though Shouwa Genroku takes a mature tone compared to Sangatsu, both of these stories are character studies and are pretty good ones at that. 
> the protagonists were obliged to choose the way that they travel still very young> are part of traditional Japanese art and are improving over time> there are several dramas and suspensions around the protagonists while developing the plot and talking more about their trades 
Both have to do with traditional Japanese arts/games and focus on the emotional impacts those skills have on the people who practice them. 
Both series are incredibly introspective series. The main characters are both melancholic but not to the point of being annoying. In fact, they both work quite well with the tone of the series (dealing with doubts and anxiety that come with pursuing a profession at a young age). Also, the supporting cast can be quite uplifting while also dealing with complex issues of their own. Overall, I'd say Rakugo is a little darker in tone as it deals with subjects such as death. However, 3-gatsu is no lightweight either as it deals with subjects such as child abuse but it definitely carries a lighter tone.  read more 
If you liked how one shows emotions, the other does it is a similar artistic and poetic way. 
 Fantastic and entertaining stories with appealing and deep character development. Drama is the strong key on both animes, showing the life and difficulties of a daily day. Both the main male characters grows in personality over the anime. 
Both are great drama anime, if you like one of these, you'll most likely love the other one.They use traditional Japanese art to tell their stories.  
Great dramas that focus on character development. With both Rei and Yakumo, their main focus in life (shogi and rakugo respectively) are things that bring them pain. To them both, this pain is brought about by losing people close to them. 
Shogi and Rakugo. Even without any prior knowledge of these subjects, both shows manage to remain extremely engaging, focusing on the struggles of very well-written characters while showing their lives and relations with others. "
31646,22135,8,"Both are coming-of-age stories that use sports as a tool for character development and focus more on the depth of the characters involved in the games and matches (even the minor ones). 
Both are sports anime that push the genre to the background in order to focus on the depth of the characters and their evolution throughout the show 
Both shows use sport as the aspect who drives many characters. 
Both are bitter sweet views on a love for a game that becomes the driving force of someone's existence. 
Both use sport as a development factor for the drama of the characters  
Sangatsu and Ping Pong both use their respective activity as a means to present character interactions and conflicts of emotion.Both also involve elements of coming-of-age, with the characters maturing, standing up against life's hardships and growing to appreciate themselves and others' being a MAJOR part of the shows' magic.These also feature an artistic element that makes them stand even more to other game/sport drama stories: Sangatsu features unique Shaft-style animated sequences that depict the mental state of characters (e.g depression, hostility, pressure), whereas Ping Pong features unorthodox direction that makes it resemble a comic rather than an animated series. 
Both explore the themes based around ""competition"" through amazing characters having different motivations, expectations from the respective games(Table Tennis & Shogi), where they end up & how they have to accept it & move forward. Both do this amazingly by having a lot of ""out of the court"" stuff, which developes characters & is exactly what makes the ""in game moments"" great. Both are beautiful & inspiring coming of age tales but while Sangatsu is slow paced, Ping Pong is fast paced. 
March Comes in Like a Lion and Ping Pong the Animation both explore what kind of people are capable of becoming professionals in a game of head-to-head competition. The characters all have different backstories, but nearly universal is some kind of hardship that motivated them to devote an incredible amount of time thinking about and practicing their craft. Simply wanting to be good at shogi/ping pong or loving the game is not sufficient -- in fact, it might be totally unrelated to the factors that make someone good enough to climb the ranks of pros. Along with this, the two shows explore the psychological toll that the constant fighting -- high stakes winning and losing -- has on competitors. Differences: Ping Pong has a very unusual animation style that makes its aesthetic unique, and it tells a story with one main arc about the protagonist and his friend. March Comes in Like a Lion is a broader story about damaged people helping each other through life. It's really striking in 3-gatsu that there are almost no bad guys and yet many characters have suffered a great deal in life -- it feels very realistic. 3-gatsu also has some story arcs that have basically nothing to do with shogi. By the time these stories develop, you're very invested in the characters and fond of them in the same way the protagonist is fond of them. Ping Pong is very good, but it's not quite as touching as 3-gatsu is.Both of these shows are sports anime, but they focus less on the details of tactics and strategy than most entries in this genre. Instead, the games are a way to look at unusual people under stress and how they handle sustained pressure. read more "
31646,28851,7,"Both of these look heavily into self-loathing and self-discovery. They are, at their cores, stories about forgiving yourself and overcoming your own psychological weaknesses. They are about discovering what it is that you want to do in life and what your passions mean. Fantastic directing, art, animation, and style in both. Some of the best at setting a deeply reflective mood. Tons of good drama and character building as well.  
Deals with a depressed kid and really conveys the emotion fantastically 
Both are heartfelt dramas that deal with depression, isolation, and the human condition. They both teeter between heavy and uplifting atmospheres and give off a similar vibe. Season 2 of 3-gatsu also touches upon bullying in a similarly beautiful manner as A Silent Voice does.If you liked A Silent Voice, you'll probably enjoy 3-gatsu and vice versa. 
Both are very personal drama's, that give the viewer credit to infer and which focus on the protagonists emotional turmoil. There isn't a shred of doubt in my mind that 3-gatsu no Lion is the most similar anime to Koe no Katachi in existence. Trust me, I've seen everything considered even remotely similar.BTW:Koe no Katachi - Definitely watch it subbed3-gatsu no Lion - Preferably watch it dubbed 
Both of these animes deal with the consequences of depression and, while to a much less pronounced extent with 3-gatsu no Lion, bullying and feelings of inadequacy. The primary driver in both of these stories is character interaction, which both helps and hurts the MCs. 
A high school student suffering from depression and loneliness has to face his past-self and grow as a person. Both of these are touching anime and if you enjoyed 3-gutsu no lion you're sure to enjoy Koe no Katachi  
Wow, Rei, Kousei and Shouya, nothing more to say about this 3. Struggling with their pasts, feeling guilty, everybody'd love to see their journey to find their true selves and seek for salvation. "
31646,22789,6,"Both is Slice of life ,you can enjoy watching the main character develop  and  the little girls in both are so cute in many ways :3  
Both main characters were isolated because of their profession. MC in 3-gatsu is a professional shogi player, MC in barakamon is a professional calligrapher. Both MC get help and inspiration from new friends.Both stories are slice of life and realistic. 
-The three sisters and people around the MC drag him out of his darkness.-Both settings feel very calming and relaxing most of the time 
If u r looking for a slice of life that makes u realize the importance of living your life by enjoying the company of others and also bringing calmness and peace of mind, then these are a must watch. U'll learn to care not only for urself but  for others also. 
-Both anime start with a depressed protagonist-Character development relies heavily on surrounding people-Excellent slice of life/drama especially 3-gatsu no lion-Good/Relaxed BGM, Super good OP, Heartwarming-Both protagonists are professional at calligraphy(barakamon) and shougi (3-gatsu)-Both characters receive support or inspiration from their friend and family 
Both 3-gatsu no Lion and Barakamon manage to combine slice of life and drama elements in an effective way. If you like your wholesome slice of life drama shows that will make you want to cheer for the characters and which also convey their personal development beautifully, I think you might like both of these anime.  "
31646,9989,3,"Both anime are of the slice of life genre and revolve around a personal past being overcome. 
Another slice of life/drama with really well written characters that feel so real they make you cherish their best moments and suffer from their worse ones. The main character is too damn relatable at times and if you enjoyed watering your eyes with Anohana this one might fit you well too. 
Alot of people have situations that are hard to deal with in life. If you want the type of anime that hits you where it hurts with feels 3-gatsu no lion will do that. Like Anohana, 3-gatsu no lion build up their characters in a really realistic way in terms of personality traits developed by their surroundings i.e. how they're treated and more. Although 3-gatsu no lion looks like another one of those ""I'm about a game"" type of animes' in this case shogi, it talks more about the character's everyday development and pulls you in by making you want to know what happens to the protagonist so much that you'll want to binge it all.Side-note :Initially I wasn't all that compelled to watch 3-gatsu no lion thinking it was another its gonna be all about shogi type of anime but I was browsing and decided to give it a try and I truly got really invested in the story. Throughout the whole anime my goldfish brain still couldn't understand shogi but I still found it very interesting to watch this anime so you don't have to worry about not understanding shogi and give this anime a try :3 read more "

31646,457,2,"Some of the animation scenes would remind you of Mushishi 
It has the same vibe as 3 gatsu no lion , that soft smooth feeling u have when u watch it is pretty much the same and both of them despite their difference in era , is very calm and beautiful and makes u think about life.If ur person who loves such types of shows , Mushishi is a must watch. "
31646,32983,2,"Warm atmosphere with lots of slice of life moments truly relaxing and very touching.The two main characters have a painful past and are orphans. They also grew up in host families.However, 3-Gatsu No Lion focuses on shogi while Natsume Yuujinchou is rather a fantasy series with supernatural creatures (yokai) 
Plotline and setting are different but I think if you enjoyed Natsume Yuujinchou, then you will enjoy 3gatsu no Lion, too.They have a familiar feeling I cannot explain well...-Main characters have similar background. Rei is an orphan who went through bad experiences and met nice people too.-Both have heartwarming and sad/bittersweet moments.-The narrative gives off a somewhat familiar feeling.-Both are slice-of-life and you can see the struggles of MC in both of them. "

The protagonist's special relationship with a boy (adult in Sangatsu) with white hair and ""angelic"" appearance.

Both stories are about one special girl and how an event on one summer day leaves a lasting effect on her family and friends, for years to come. There's the main character who holds the girl's affections, the boy who can only watch in envy, and the girl who always feels like she's in the shadow of that special girl. Add to it feelings of regret and guilt, wishes, and dreams, you get two great slice of life, coming of age stories. 
one has baseballone has ghostsother than that, they're kind of the same. 
They both have stories that kind of center on the male protagonist's deceased childhood friend/girlfriend, and both give off the same kind of feeling. 
Even though Cross Game is about baseball the underlying themes are similar to Ano Hana. Also some plot elements are very similar between the 2 series. 
Both anime are very similar. strong bond between childhood friends, having one special girl in their childhood, and making her last dream come true. the difference is that Anohana with ghost but no baseball while Cross Game with baseball but no ghost (or at least it's left to the viewer's interpretation) 
I only recommend these two for each other based on a single similarity ...but it is a very striking similarity both shows carry. Both deal with childhood friends and death, and both also show the gradual reconciliation of feelings toward the dead and coming to terms with it. Both are also very sweet and extremely sad. So I only recommend one for the other if you saw one and enjoyed the parts dealing with the dead and the romance with the shows.Otherwise, the shows are pretty different. CG is slower paced and about baseball while Anohana is about a group of friends who have broken apart. read more 
3 of the 6 main characters are the same seiyuu in Cross Game.The interactions of characters and underlying story are similar except Cross game has an added sport and competitive element. 
Both series adapts a similar tone of story telling involving a young girl who was once a special person (childhood friend) in the main protagonist's life. They have a lighthearted atmosphere that follows a sort of slice of life adaptation.Both series has theme of friendship involving the main protagonist and the other characters he has interactions with. There is also hints of romance, drama, comedy, and emotional moments. 
you get the same feling for both of the romance and the characters that tomatsu haruka voices for. They both hate the person they love. very teary ad motional. i cried every episode. one answrs the other's question.""Do ghosts grow?""You would want to answer,""Yes, they do!""anyway the're both a very good an emotional anime. 
Both of these anime are very similar both are about childhood friends that are very close to each other and then suddenly an unexpected scenario will happen can they overcome it or not? 
Both of these anime deal with young children losing a special someone close to them and how that loss affects them in the future. One of the main motivations the characters have is making the deceased's dream come true. "
5941,627,10,"Well both are about baseball and they have several other similarities; however, i don't want to give anything away so you'll just have to watch to find out!! ^_^ 
Both baseball animes in which the main characters are determined to advance in baseball because of some emotional event experienced in their lives.  
A similar event occurs early on in both shows. The male main characters are power pitchers. Both shows have a baseball loving female main character. 
Both about baseball, though Cross Game a little ""lighter"" and Major is more of a serious anime. Same kind of chars and similiar story 
Baseball, Romance, Tragedy, Friends, HardWork 
Both of them are similar because they both love baseball and improve. The main characters are alike. The anime shows little bit of romance, childhood, and both characters been through a death of someone they love and cared for. So if you love cross game then you will love major or if you love major then you will love cross game. 
They are both baseball animes. Without giving out spoilers, similar situations occur to them. This leads to the protagonist maturing through the sport. 
If you love a good story chronicling someones life through baseball, than you have to watch the king of them all, Cross Game 
People close to the Main Character die in both series, only that in Cross game, it's in episode 1, but it's still sad, considering how old they are, and their relationships.You get to follow the MC as they grow up, and there are some really emotional scenes, that involve the MC recalling memories of the important person's death throughout the show. Both about baseball, and rising to the top. 
Both amazing baseball storiesMC goes through heartbreak during the beginningBoth MCs are powerful pitchers that can throw up to around 97-99 MPH. "
5941,2402,2,"Hard-hitting and realistic sports anime with stories that make full use of ordinary life. Ashita no Joe is about boxing while Cross Game is about baseball, but they're much more similar than it may seem.  
Although they are different sports, Ashita no Joe and Cross Game, are very similar, dealing with how the daily life of their characters is presented, showing all the evolution in its maturity. The drama is also one of the focuses of Cross Game, although it is more intense in Ashita no Joe. "
5941,1842,2,"High schoolers trying to get to Koshien :) 
Cross Game and the 3rd season of Major are basically the same.They both involve an aspiring pitcher, and his goal to get to Koshien. The protagonists also went through a traumatic incident in their past. They both have female love interests that love to play baseball. Also I couldn't help but notice that they both have the same high school name ""Seishuu"". Sports anime is not a very popular genre, but I recommend that you should see Major S3 and Cross Game, because they are both suspenseful, romantic, and most importantly enjoyable.  "
5941,22135,2,"Both series portray action in a realistic high school setting, revolving around how the main characters who are initially indifferent to sports, despite having the required talent, gradually develop a liking towards it and start playing more seriously. Both shows leave you with an understanding of how talent, hard-work and genuine interest are not independent factors of success but complement one another. 
Both animes are superb coming of age stories that might make you reconsider your goals in life. While Cross Game offers a much slower pace Ping Pong will quickly suck you into fast paced matches "
5941,263,2,"Both have those hard training scenes that lead to improvemnts in there chosen sport. Both involve tough bad asses! Both are very  funny at times and have a nice amount of drama. Both have a sub romance theme and both are great easy watches (smooth rolling with nice art, excellnt story line, and matching music to really allow u to feel the anime. if u like one then yes u should definetly watch the other 
Cross game and Hajime no Ippo are dramatic, and makes you care about the characters outside of the field,ring respectively. They are both VERY addictive and will make you want to marathon through them. If you like the fact that you cared about the characters then either of these anime will satisfy that need.  "
37999,1535,18,"-Both feature a psychological duel between two main characters in order to achieve an important objective-Both take themselves very seriously during these scenes and feature similar buildups and use of musical scores-Both do an excellent job at developing both their primary and supporting casts, adding to the believability of the environment the story takes place in 
This what happen if Yagami & L reincarnated to romcom anime.Kaguya is very similar to Yagami. The color theme, evil expression style, also she is manipulative, will do anything to accomplish her goal, have advantage and exploit it.Meanwhile, Miyuki her rival bit similar to L too, he is more smart than her, but have less advantage position. 
Both titles are about the psychological warfare between two characters. They feature the mind games of two strong protagonists who will make you root for both of them at the same time. Obviously Kaguya-sama is a romance based mind game, while Death Note is a detective series. 
Both are series involving battles of wits between two geniuses from different parts of society who really, really, really want to go to bone town on each other.  
Two different geniuses who engage in a dramatic mental battles with one another, with incredibly unrealistic yet entertainingly complex and over the top strategy. 
While having contrasting tones, both shows heavily focus on mind games and psychological warfare between the 2 protagonists into confessing (literally in Kaguya-sama, figuratively in Death Note) 
Both series involve a battle of wits in which their two protagonists engage in a fierce struggle to outdo each other, with the main difference being that Kaguya-sama takes a more comedic approach. The main characters are well-developed and viewers will occasionally find themselves cheering for both sides.  
Both Kaguya-sama and Death Note have a mental game between two great minds. 
The comparison might be a little odd but both manga involve a lot of mind games and intelligent characters trying to trick eachother just unlike Death Note Kaguya sama is all about romance. So if you are interested in a Death Note without the philosophy but love instead this is the manga for you. 
Both series contains battle of wits between the main casts. Kaguya is more comedic in tone, whereas Death Note is more mature. The main duo of each series are well developed and likable.  
They're an intense psychological battle in between the minds of our main two protagonists who are both smart and cunnng. They think of every possible decision and what can go wrong if they choose the wrong option. They also try and get the other person to admit to something that is important to the story. One difference is that one is a romantic comedy, while the other is a psychological thriller. 
Two smart characters attempt to outwit each other throughout the show. 
Kaguya sama is, like one user has noted, the lighthearted rom-com adaptation of Death Note. The battle of the minds, but instead of a global scale of death and destruction, of two student council members.  
This might look weird, to compare this two shows, but Kaguya-sama shows what would happen if L and Yagami fell in love. Both characters try to “hunt down” each other. However, Kaguya-sama as a very light, comedy, funny tone. Not so dark as Death Note 
Most was already saidIt's weird but Kaguya definitely has Death Note vibes, that's while those shows are completely different in tone. They don't actually have much in common, exept one big nuance- Both are focused around characters, that think a lotIn Death note there were lots of smart thoughts, in Kaguya there was a lot of fun ""overthinking"" 
Kaguya-sama is the more lighthearted romantic comedy version of the more darker toned Death Note. We have 2 brilliant minded people trying to catch one another, one anime is for the purpose of confessing love while the other is for the purpose of bringing the other down by their sense of justice. We have Kaguya who is the Light Yagami of the series, a very cunning, manipulative character who is one step ahead of her rival and using every advantage at her will to make rival confess to her. And lastly we have Shirogane, the Lawliet L of the series who even though he is the smarter than his rival, he is at a disadvantage but is always the one closer to make Kaguya finally break and confess.While Kaguya-sama is satirically using the tropes of psychological animes to create humorous moments and this subversive use of a conventional serious thrillers ends up making for a great tool to tell its story in a new and unique way. The same techniques that worked great for psychological thrillers such as Death Note read more 
If you like a masterpiece like Death Note, then you might also like Kaguya-sama wa kokurasetai. Both anime titles include a battle of wits, in which two characters are fighting a tough fight to surpass each other, Kaguya-sama is more comedic and funny anime, with a school theme, and Death Note has a more mystical and serious atmosphere, I recommend that you watch kaguya sama wa kokurasetai, you will definitely like it, I'm sure! 
kaguya is actually light vs l but with straight relationship and more funnyboth using brains to make the others loseMisa looks like chika but chika is more useful and cute "
37999,38691,2,"Both shows have very similar humor and stylistic slapstick. While Dr. Stone focuses on science in an apocalyptic world with comedy on the side, Kaguya-sama: Love is War continues a similar joke style but places it’s characters in a totally different environment. Even though the characters are distinctly different, both shows leave similar impressions on the viewer that makes a transition between the two really seamless. 
While one may be a romance story and the other a shonen, each of them have the similar chaotic comedy behind them. Tons of charm are put into the jokes and characters that can be occasionally hard to find. Basically, both these shows are hilarious. "
37999,11843,2,"Similar, sketch-sequence dynamic across the episodes.  Very frantic and entertaining and even in a school setting.  Both a must watch. 
same day-by-day-, situation-by-situation type story telling, keep in mind though that Kaguya-sama is a romance, but it doesn't have that cheesy & slow build up that most romance shows do as its also a seinenthey both have the same type of meta humor that doesn't really rely or overplay on one single trope like most other comedy-centered anime do which is really nice "
37999,5081,2,"This is a recommendation to Monogatari series in general. Both Kaguya-sama and Monogatari series heavily uses narration in their story telling, and is done well. Both anime are also presented in a pretty unique style, giving a new kind of experience in this medium. The difference is Kaguya-sama is more episodic, while Monogatari series have an overarching plot. 
Both suprisingly had a very nice slick art that your eyes will enjoy "
37999,37450,2,"Both of these shows are of romance genre with a hint of humour. Though I admit that ""Kaguya-sama..."" is more of a romantic comedy, but it as well has moments when drama kicks in.Generally speaking, if you're a fan of romance with a hint of comedy and drama, these shows are perfect for you. 
You will like these animes no matter which genre you prefer. Both animes seem to attract all types of anime watchers. "
38889,23273,1,Both shows are music-themed and have a great story and character development. Kono Oto Tomare has a pretty slow development at the start but it's necessary. It really starts shining in 2nd season of the show. 
2246,457,42,"The story lines are pretty similar. They both feature a male lead that travels in search of supernatural events and spirits, etc. And both are episodic type animes.  
The premises of both involve their respective main characters (usually mistaken as being mere medicine men due to their appearances) traveling around period piece Japan and solving supernatural problems. But Mononoke lacks Mushishi's depth since, where as the Mushi in Mushishi are an extension of nature that aren't inherently good or bad (nature can be cruel, folks!), the titular Mononoke are vengeful spirits that need to be put to rest. Both series follow a pattern of gaining understanding before the problems can be resolved, but Mononoke's stories nearly all being related to vengeance left much more restricted and limited: always having a murder mystery 'whodunnit?' approach. Also, Mononoke's nameless lead was never explained, and never will be since there's no source material. On the other hand, Mushishi's lead, Ginko, has a full back-story. In a nutshell, the premises are very similar but what separates the two is that Mononoke is very much style over substance, where as Mushishi is substance over style. read more 
Both stories involed a man wandering around japan carrying around a wooden box and deals with supernatural entities and helps people along the way. Mononoke is a lot darker and a bit more cynical then Mushishi is, and the Medicine Seller is more of an anti hero, but that doesn't keep him from being an enjoyable, interesting character. The stories in both series are interesting, each being self contained, though Monoke tells it's stories in a series of 5 arcs. Also, Mononoke's stories are always more on the horror side of things, whereas Mushishi's are usually more emotional. 
Both look amazing, while Mononokes art is more abstract is still manages to immerse the viewer.Both have a medicine seller who traverses from place to place attempting to solve paranormal situations. 
Both deal with the supernatural and both have charismatic lead characters. The drawings in Mononoke will take a little getting used to. Just a little warning, some parts of Mononoke can be quite scary compared to Mushishi.  
Anime with Unique art? Relating to a search of mystic beings of some sorts? You got it in these both. Although both do have their differences, if you loved one, you'll love the other. As a bonus, both protagonists are lovable (in a hot, respectable way).  
Both series concern a main character who travels around solving supernatural problems. The Medicine Seller has his mononoke, and Ginko has his mushi. 
Both series have a travelling protagonist who helps different people in each episode or story arc with supernatural creatures they don't understand -- traditional Japanese spirits in Mononoke, and unusual nature spirits in Mushishi. 
If you liked the story about a man wandering around from place to place, ""saving"" people from supernatural creatures, then Mononoke is for you. But Mononoke has bizarre scenes, really artistic detalis, and also...it's a dark version of Mushishi.  
Episodic and is similar in the fact that the protagonist is a traveller and medicine seller eliminating supernatural creatures. In Mushishi it was Mushis and in Mononke it is the poor mononokes being terminated. Both are amazing shows. 
Both series features a traveling mysterious main character that deals with supernatural phenomena around. While melancholy and drama are foremost for Mushishi and mystery for Mononoke they still have a similar mood. Their artwork have different stylings, but the approach of evershifting reality and simplicity is close. 
Both have a main character dealing with weird supernatural happenings.  
Both series have a travelling main character who specialises in dealing with paranormal beings, they also both have amazing art, though mononoke is more abstract. 
Both series deal with the supernatural and follow the journeys of a fascinating lead character. There is no over-arching plotline, but a succession of situations involving strange creatures and humans. Each has an original and distinct atmosphere with great art, animation and soundtrack. 
You could swap the plot summaries for each of these shows and it would still make sense. They are about a travelling man wandering from place to place solving problems related to supernatural entities. Mononoke focuses more on the horror aspect of these entities, Mushishi focuses more on the surreal and enchanting, and both are excellent at what they do. The main characters also share a lot of similarities, though Ginko is much more relatable to the viewer, as we do get glimpses into his past. 
Both Mushishi and Mononoke are about traveling ""magicians"" who help solve peoples' problems. Both stories take place during an Edo-like period and have beautiful character designs. Mononoke has longer story arcs while Mushishi has a one-shot episode format. Ginko (Mushishi) is more personable while Kusuriuri (Mononoke) is more ethereal.   
Main heroes of both anime are travelling soul healers. Esotheric, psychedelic, psychological, simple but deep meaning, cleanse yourself, find your zen. 
Both anime are episodic, has a wandering medicine seller main character. One is chasing after rumours about mononoke and the other is chasing about mushi rumours.Each of the main characters is helping people with their skills and knowledge.Mononoke is harder to understand, even with a well understanding of japanese culture and history. Each detail in Mononoke has an explanation.Both anime are interesting to watch. If you like one of these, you might like the other. 
The similarity is that both Ginkgo and Kusuriuri use their knowledge to help when it comes to the spiritual world and the problems that may occur whit contact between the human and mysterious. Besides that, inner fulfillment exists when watching both anime. 
Mononoke is kinda like a much more sinister version of Mushishi.  Both feature an enigmatic medicine seller (although Ginko is more developed) roaming the land ""exorcising"" mysterious spirits.  Mononoke is more of an atmospheric pseudo-horror anime though, and the art is much more stylized (and absolutely jaw-dropping it is). 
Both have a very similar feel to themboth are episodicBoth Leads go around running into supernatural events both have white hair XD Both have a an eerie atmosphereBoth leads ""help"" or give advice about different phenomenons to people on their travels 
Exactly the same story, but Mononoke is more psychological and horror-infused, while Mushishi is more philosophical and peaceful. Mushishi's world is somewhat more grounded, while Mononoke is heavily centered around Japanese mythology. The simplest way I can put it is that Mononoke is Mushishi's dark, edgier brother - Don't take that as an insult though; Both shows are mature, beautiful looking, and thought-provoking, and can even deliver strong emotional punches. 
It can't be said enough, but anyone who liked one show will like the others. Ginko and the Medicine Peddler may have starkly different methods, outlooks on life, and motivations, there is something that ties the two shows together.  
Mysterious wandering protagonists with a suitcase of curios travelling and interacting with the world's more unearthly inhabitants.Very different art styles, but with a similar atmosphere humming quietly with curiosity, showing the subtle enjoyment found in travelling and learning. Not as serious as people make them out to be, there is plenty of humour and silliness, just not as loud as in other shows. 
I could talk about episodic construction these titles which improves impression that they touch the most basic themes human's lives. Or maybe I could tell you about the protagonists who always give the victim a hand but provided that this person wants his help and change the status quo. I could talk... but it is not really important. They are so specific that not everybody will be satisfied after them. But they are worth trying. 
A wandering salesman often traveling in rural country is usually tasked with combating supernatural enemies or hindrances. Both main characters have an easy going nature and tend to be highly respected individuals when people figure out who they are.  
In both animes, the main character travels around the world: finding answers about rumours related to mushis in Mushishi's case and related to demons in Mononoke's case.Both are composed by short stories well structured. 
both series are episodic with a mysterious main character and have supernatural elementes.  
Luminous paths. Bewitching Sceneries. What can travellers see else?Ginko and Kusuriuri are similar to personality, profession, purpose. They traveling various places, and there are all sorts of drama.Sometimes fortunate. Sometimes melancholy. Nobody knows what will happen to their life.Mushishi is style of calm. Profound story draw in you. That's beautiful suggestiveness.Contrastingly, Mononoke is very fright, eerie. You can see Kusuriuri's coolness that unleash sword of exterminating evil.Both plot is almost episodic. As stated previously, travellers go many new lands. Each episode content is quite deep.Art and Soundtrack also great. Both are beauty, remaining easy to impression.If you liked Mushishi or Ginko, you definitely like Mononoke and Kusuriuri.Well, if possible, I have Mushishi's sequels to watch you. More energetic. read more 
Mononoke and Mushishi are quite similar, despite the difference in art styles and general 'vibe'. The two main characters share a similar... occupation if you will. They both spend their days travelling in search of Mushi, or Mononoke. Both stories are interesting, however unlike Mushishi, Mononoke doesn't go episode by episode. The arcs take 2-3 episodes, however each arc is still interesting. Mononoke also contains a catch, unlike Mushishi where Ginko can easily solve an issue in a single episode. 
Both revolve around mysterious travelers traveling around with their big back bags they both travel around to exorcise creatures that affects a place or a human in an unnatural way 
The main characters are both wanderers and travel around the country to solve the problems caused by supernatural beings. I lack the words to properly describe the genre, so I'll label them both as ""food-for-thought-anime"". If you like short stories with a deeper meaning, then Mushishi / Mononoke (depending on which one you haven't watched yet) is definitely worth (binge) watching. 
I wonder why I forgot to create this recommendation as it is so obvious.Mononoke and Mushishi certainly appeal to the same audience. If you are looking for unique exorcism anime look no further. If you enjoyed one of these, you will certainly enjoy the other as they even share a similar mini-arc episodic story (Mononoke arcs are longer though). Even both protagonists work as lone medicine sellers that deal with demons for a living.Smart 'demons' designs that are more of phenomena than evil creatures, a very mysterious protagonist and incredible and unique visuals mark some of the similarities.Both certainly have this ""creepy"" and eerie aura in some scenes as well. read more 
While both of these shows share an episodic format and a similar ""plot"", they have a different form of entertaining viewers. In Mushishi, the MC isn't always fully involved with the incidents shown and in some episodes he doesn't even appear until the last few minutes. In Mononoke, you're with the MC from start to finish; he's always involved with the supernatural incidents.When you watch Mushishi, you enjoy the stories it brings; when you watch Mononoke, you enjoy not only the stories presented, but also the mysterious and enigmatic MC. 
Both shows have the main character traveling to different places helping people who have issues with the supernatural. 
- both shows follow a traveler who is fighting against supernatural creatures- supernatural elements in both shows are highly influenced by Japanese mythology and beliefs- MCs of both shows are pretty quiet and they are only interested in their jobs- both shows are made up of stories that are not connected to each other 
they both solve problem for other people, give kinda the siimilar vibe but mushishi is more to the relax, quite side. and mononoke is more into cult thing and have some action and disturbing image one or two 
Both feature supernatural creatures in which both main characters travel around to either exterminate or get rid of in the manner of healing. Both of these shows are episodic and don't really require a certain watch order. Additionally, both main characters are cryptic and much isn't known about either of them. Their moral values, previous life experiences, etc. are not really known. Essentially a very similar show except that Mononoke is far more abstract and artistic. 
The show follows a protagonist that is minor to the story. The show is not about the protagonist himself, but the monsters that they encounter and their stories. 
Both are episodic, and have beautiful stories. The art is great for both of them, though in completely different styles--Mushishi is tranquil and peaceful, while Mononoke is eerie and haunting. But both feautre a mysterious traveller who visits households and people to offer aid from supernatural things that is not so easily understandable or remedied, and for both, the travellers are not the protagonists of the episodes, they are the catalysts through which we get to know the stories.  
The main selling point of both shows is that it mesmerizes its viewers by telling daunting, unsettling, and beautifully absorbing stories incorporated into an episodic-type anime. 
A mysterious being wanders Japan, seeking out otherworldly creatures and saving people from their ignorance through a combination of skill, technique and wit.  "
2246,5081,11,"Series of short story arcs centred upon supernatural entities (Aberrations in Bakemonogatari and Mononoke in Mononoke) taking form and haunting characters. While Mononoke focuses more on the stories and Bakemonogatari on the characters, they structure their short arcs very similarly, both narrative-wise and progression. Both series share this style of storytelling presented with a unique style of animation: Bakemonogatari is more Shaft than the average Shaft, and Mononoke takes upon itself a very ""Japanese"" style to fit their respective settings. 
Both series centre around sequential arcs in which the protagonist tackles a supernatural entity plaguing humans by unravelling the circumstances surrounding it. Bakemonogatari has a modern setting while Mononoke is a period piece, so they complement each other with the contrast. 
Both are arc-based stories dealing with one specific supernatural entity in each arc. The true nature of the situation is not always readily apparent at the beginning of the arc but is revealed by the end. They also both have a very distinctive visual style, though not necessarily in the same way. 
Both animes are stories about supernatural beings. Bakemonogatari is about oddities and Mononoke is about demons. Both are also made in an unothordox way regarding the animation style and art. 
both series feature the same sort of paranormal mystery aspect, though the two go about it in a different timeframe and fashion. Both feature a unique sort of artwork seen in anime, though the two aren't all too similar in that respect. 
These two anime are alike for the structure and the very basis of the show. They are both anime about the supernatural separated into arcs. While Mononoke has a better focus on the execution and the art. Bakemonogatari is more character and dialogue based. 
Two series about Japanese apparitions. They're not very similar storytelling-wise, but Mononoke's MC (the Apothecary) is quite similar to Oshino Meme, an aberration specialist from Monogatari (they even share the voice actor). If you enjoy encounters with the supernatural, both series should suit you. 
Very supernatural, mysterious, Japanese, arc-driven series.Both have psychedelic art, one of them having it as a basis for the whole anime.Paying attention is the norm for watching the two series.One thing though, while both animes have Mystery tags, Mononoke falls more into the horror genre, while the Monogatari series is focused more on romance and fanservice. 
Bakemonogatari and Mononoke are surprisingly similar. The latter is definitely more serious, with a heavy psychological focus, whereas the first has no shame in being irreverent and constantly playing around with meta-references (although it never strays into fields of shameless idiocy or exaggerated humor). Both, however, present unique storytelling and a distinctive and highly experimental (Mononoke being much more iconoclastic) audiovisual experience. Words, images, and sounds are just as important as narration in both cases. And in both cases, it never fails to be interesting.And by far the most interesting connection among them is how the arcs are focused on the characters and their inner struggles and contact with supernatural entities rather than a ""master-storyline"" that guides the entire show. read more 
Bakemonogatari and Mononoke feature unique art and direction as well as a lot of dialogue. The shows consist of a series of arcs focused on the supernatural which are well complemented by their music and style. 
they are both psychological animes with mystery and supranatural in them. "
2246,6594,5,"If you enjoy the intriguing art style of Katanagatari, the feeling of being suspended in a Japanese painting, then you may be interested in checking out Mononoke for a similar, yet completely unique style. 
They both have eclectic visuals and a creative sense of style. Even though the stories are different they both have similar atmospheres and take place in odd worlds. 
The main plot is different, however the artstyle are both incredible and hold the same kind of influence. Japanese wood prints. If you've seen Kana', you need to see Mononoke. 
Interesting art styles and full of engaging dialogue. Music that fits perfectly with the shows' tone. Mononoke and Katanagatari are both very unique and clever in terms of their execution and direction, giving a rich experience for the brain as well as the eyes and ears. 
Both series have a unique design and also have good stories, if you liked one you may like the other or vice versa. "
2246,7785,3,"Similar to Kuuchuu Buranko, pretty trippy and you have to infer the story. Once you understand the story it's mindblowing. These are shows that force you to think and really understand what is going on in the show. 
In both series, the art style  and the development is pretty unique. If you liked Mononoke you should really try Yojo-Han 
Although there are little similarities between these two in terms of story or genre (Mononoke is horror/demons while The Tatami Galaxy is comedy), their animation and art style are very unique and top-notch.  If you are looking for great stories paired with great visuals, these two are for you. "
2246,199,1,"Despite their disparate art styles, Spirited Away and Mononoke have very similar atmospheres. This in part stems from more traditional Japanese influences (themes centering around Shinto, social structure, and other worlds, etc.) mixing with more contemporary aesthetic and narrative features of anime. Also, while I am sure there are more natural comparisons, the fact that these are both so strong makes the watching experience hard to equal in both cases. "
10162,22789,35,"Both have the adult main character growth led by the children surrounding them. Although Usagi Drop feels more dramatic, while Barakamon is more subtle to send a message to the viewers. Both are excellent slice-of-life anime and with great character development. And the feels. 
The second  I saw this coming out I got so excited because it reminded me so much of Usagi Drop, one of my favorite slice-of-lives. Energetic, eccentric, sort of wild little girls coming along and brightening the lives of stuffy guys away from the city, these stories both share this plot. The art work is also similar, as well as the laid-back, vibe. Both little girls are funny and endearing, and both men are subdued at first but of course fall for the amazing kids personalities.  
A guy stumbles upon taking care of a young girl that he didn't expect to take care of. Though the differences are, Usagi Drop is more dramatic than Barakamon, which is more of a silly little light-hearted comedy. 
The main lead characters share an unique bond throughout both series despite their contrasting differences from the beginning. There's an initial development as they learn more about each other and what they enjoy in life. The main male protagonist shares similar personalities and at times can become frustrated at certain events. However, they often take on life as it is with smiles and joy. When it comes down to it, relationship dynamics are a key focus in both series. Recommended for any viewers interested in a charming slice of life. 
• Both shows have an adult male protagonist who grow through building relationships with children (just one with Usagi)• Both are Slice of Life but with serious undertones - although Usagi is more serious• Both have great artwork, characters and plot• Both are extremely heartwarming  
No, I'm not linking these two together because they're both about an adult male taking care of a little girl. Both of these shows make you feel at home and have tons of SOL symbollism that link to morals and themes you would find in real life. Both of these shows tackle family values and realistic character growth. The only difference is that Barakamon is focused on Handa's career (the adult) while Usagi Drop is focused on how Daikichi's life and how he adapts because of Rin. 
Both shows feature an adult being close and caring for a kid (in a non-creepy way) and they're both cute. The differences are that in Barakamon there's the element of the main character's calligraphy career and they're on an island like the countryside but in Usagi Drop there's only the one theme of caring for the kid. 
Both shows have a main character that learns responsibility through their newfound role as surrogate caretaker for a child. 
Barakamon and Usagi Drop are about an adult with a kid hanging around with him. Barakamon is more about a carefree lifestyle while Usagi Drop is bit more seriousness in it since it is within family relationship. While Usagi Drop contain a lot of character development throughout the series, Barakamon is more towards slice of life anime around the village without any romance.Both anime give out heartwarming feeling while watching them, you will definitely think of one another anime if you're already watching one of them. 
Both is about how children's can change a persons life.But not just that.Really funny,loving,cute, also some parts are really touching.Great animes with a sence of summer that you can't avoid  falling in love with them!! 
The main character is an adult who develops alongside a precocious and endearing child with whom he forms a strong, realistic bond. Barakamon is more humorous and Usagi Drop is more heartwarming, but both shows are quite similar and enjoyable to watch. 
When you just want a good, clean story about a man having to live in harmony with a child that's not his. The two anime also compliment each other by masterfully intervolving normal, daily events into bonding exercises between the adults and the children. Just for your own sake, perhaps consider avoiding the Usagi Drop manga if you're interested in it ~ 
Both have everyday life vibe to it, both are heartwarming and very relaxing. If you feel sad or tired, these two shows will make you forget it. 
-Both have adorable kawaii little kids.-Boosts your mood when you are down or neutral.-Both make you feel warm in the inside. xD-You won't stop smiling until the very end.-One of the best slice-of-life anime out there. If you're a slice-of-life kind of individual, then don't miss these gems. 
Both male characters play a substitute role of parent with a child who wants nothing more than to be happy.Both influence each other and are influenced by those around them and show how simply is to get happiness. 
Both Anime have a really relaxed story telling about a more adult character.The plot is completely different but both anime have this magical ""relaxed"" feeling while you are watching the episodes piece by piece. It's the perfect Anime after a stressfull day.(Also the humour from both shows are just hilarious) 
Both are slice-of-life-ish but not necessarily episodic, both involve MCs who are a tad short of middle age and in career ruts, both show MCs making positive strides in their respective social developments, both involve really fun realistic child characters, both are short sweet shows, and both involve pretty artwork and very little ""action"".Barakamon isn't about parenting which is one of Usagi Drop's things, but there are tons of similarities nonetheless.I personally preferred Barakamon to Usagi Drop as the former showed a bit more character development but the difference isn't massive. Good shows both and worth a try even for people who normally don't care for slice of life read more 
Both are slice of life animes that involve adult to child relationships.  Both animes involve protagonists that are suddenly thrown into unfamiliar social environments but but adapt to their situations and build character from their experiences.  They are both refreshingly realistic in the way the characters interact with one another and how they handle change.  Usagi Drop is more realistic than Barakamon in the relationship between its characters, but the latter compensates with the synergy formed by the personality gap between its characters. 
Both Barakamon and Usagi drop are feel-good slice of life shows with a story or theme centered around children and their impact on an adults life (with this being slightly more prominent in Usagi Drop, with neither of the two possessing any ""fantastical"" or out of the ordinary (in regards to real life) aspects.Either show is likely to leave you feeling warm inside by the end of it's run. 
Both are lovely slice-of-life anime with a focus on the relationship between children and adults. Humorous and sweet. 
Both anime have a lighthearted, playfull air with occasionally some deeper elements. The comedy itself is similar  in both anime and serves as a nice extra without being relied upon. The story in both anime focuses on the lives of a still kind of young, single man, looking for his place in the world. A small girl plays an important role in both of their searches. 
both of these stories start with meeting a child these children lead them to different events in their lifestyle which they are similar,but both of them are very interesting on their own i realllyy recommend watching either one  
A sweet young girl, suddenly enters the life of a solitary working man, and changes the way he perceives things in a delightful way. 
both deal with a friendship between an adult man and an unusual young girl near-flawlessly and are refreshingly free of awkward tropes. Usagi Drop is more focused on the struggle of a new parent, while Barakamon focuses more on the friendship involved, but in both cases it is handled very sensitively and leaves you with a warm fuzzy feeling. 
If you like children, you will definitely enjoy both. They both are set where a male adult is living with children surround them. The characters are all lovable and enjoyable to watch. However, Usagi drop has a dramatic setting in which Daikichi needs to adapt his ""new"" way of living with Rin while Barakamon has a ""Slice of life/Comedy"" tone to it.If you have time, you check out both! 
Character development of the MC through the presence of a younger childBarakamon has a subtle change while Usagi Drop is a bit on the serious note. 
In both Anime does the main character have, to a certain degree, a father role to the child he's taking care of.Both anime are slice of lifeAnd both anime are on a more slower pace making them easy relaxing shows for the most part. 
Barakamon and Usagi Drop have 'father figures' as their central characters and show these characters' grow when they take on responsibility and interact with the children who look up to them.  
both had adult protagonist and had children too take care but usagi drop more dramatic and barakamon more comedy. 
Both anime are similar in story and character where both anime tells the story about a male adult take care of girl. The girl isn't similar but the similar things is how the MC get troubled with every thing concerning the girls. It's fun and it's a good anime to watch when you're tired and need some entertainment.  
Is so beatiful, how the relation into the person of anime, kid with u (""father""), make you want one son. 
They're both heartwarming and simplistic which will calm your mind. Both shows have unusual family circumstances and the main character learns how to adjust to their odd circumstances. It maturely handled themes with the importance of family values/morals in a subtle manner. 
Both are similar in a lot of ways especially in terms of the artstyle and the chemistry with Handa Sei and Kotoshi Naru is very similar to the relationship in Usagi Drop with Kawachi Dai and Kaga Rin. While Usagi Drop is more of a drama rather then being a light hearted comedy it does have a couple of funny scenes with the character interactions both have really lovable characters but in my opinion personally out of the two shows I like Usagi Drop a little more because it's main story is more developed and impactful I prefer Barakamon for it's comedy and slapstick humor both are Great Slice of Life anime in my opinion I highly recommend you watch both. read more 
-Excellent slice of life feeling-Protagonist development surrounding by younger people-Heartwarming as hell-Unique relation between kids and protagonist-Relaxed/Chilling pace-Comedy/drama work between each other pretty good 
The main similarity with Usagi Drop and Barakamon is that both of them have lots of heartfelt messages to share. While the latter is a bit more light and relaxed, the former showcases a bit more dramatic atmosphere to inspire some mellow emotions from the viewer. Now as for the character persona, it'd be weird if you didn't notice the very apparent resemblance (as that is the the biggest correspondence of all for both). "

Both stories revolve around a single parent attempting to find a way to raise a child/children on their own and the trials and tribulations that follow. 
Both show the struggles of being a single parent caring for children. They are slice-of-life anime that are really really heartwarming. 
They both are simple stories about life. While ookami has a plot in the last 1/3, Usagi Drop continues to have the simple tale. That doesn't mean they both are bad, since they don't have plots. It's actually their simplicity that makes it so engaging. They both heavily emphasize about how cutesy both animes are suppose to be and we grow with the characters. they are both fun and have magnificent storytelling that makes the characters extremely gratifying. 
Both are the only shows in existence about parenting  worthwhile. Just please don't read the usagi drop manga. 
Both anime contain a main character that take cares of kids with him/her self, and both of them had much trouble to get use of taking care of children. 
Parents make all sorts of sacrifices to raise their children. These sacrifices are compounded for single parents. The reward of seeing their children grow is quite motivating. Both are centred around such stories and are told from the parent's point of view.The artwork and sound track to both are absolutely great.Usagi Drop has a much more happy and light feeling to it where as Ookami Kodomo no Ame to Yuki has one of the saddest openings ever and a bittersweet ending, especially if you are a parent. 
Single-parenting with extraordinary circumstances. 
They are both about the idea of growing up; being raised by a parent until they are capable of being independent. The animation style for both titles are very simple but bright, and their ost, in my opinion, sound very similar at times. Although Ookami Kodomo no Ame To Yuki is about raising wolf-children, rather than human-children, both anime have the same feeling to them while watching; the viewer could even feel accustomed to the idea that raising animals as their own children is perfectly normal, making both titles, naturally, a relaxing watch. 
Both about raising a child alone with one of the parents is missing and both have the same aura 
Similarity- point difficulty of single mum/dad that have to raise kid aloneDifference- Ookami (movie) is a lot more struggling because the mother has to raise her two werewolves kid in human world alone since they were born.  
Usagi Drop and Wolf Children are both masterpieces about the difficulties of raising a child. Both have unique artwork, exceptional characters and stories, and while Usagi Drop is more simplistic and easy to follow, it's an anime that doesn't get enough credit! So, if you loved Wolf Children, WATCH IT! "
10162,4181,11,"- Family.- Responsibility.- Coming to terms with taking care of a child.- Heartwarming.- Slice-of-life, comedy, drama.- Good parent/guardian.- Adorable daughter. 
While Clannad After Story is not entirely about raising a child, it does spend a significant amount of time developing its adolescent character. If you liked the parent concept in After Story then you will enjoy Usagi Drop as the entire show is about what it's like to be a parent. Both anime display great emotions that will make you both happy and sad throughout the journey. 
Anime that tell a story about how a single 20-30-year-old man raise a very young child alone. Both stories take audience through the hard yet satisfying trip known as parenthood. 
Usagi Drop is also about a single guardian raising a child, and it has a similar feel to it. The stories are both heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time. 
Both focus on the challenges it takes as a single parent to become a blissful family after tragedy of some type, though Clannad 2nd season can be grim and not for the light hearted. Clannad 2nd season's main focus is more drama and romance for the beginning majority as well. Although both do have very enjoyable prevailing slice of life theme too. Excellent voice acting for both series. 
If you can't get enough of the cuteness of raising a little girl, you should definitely watch the other. In both series, a single father starts to raise a cute girl around 5 years old. Both fathers go through significant character development after taking on their new roles. The challenges and emotions of this are portrayed heavily.Be warned though, Clannad: After Story has a lot more drama and tragedy. Usagi Drop is a happy walk in the part by comparison. 
This anime has some of the same the father-daughter cuteness going for it. The main characters both learn and grow a lot from the beginning to the end of both shows. Once you, personally, have finished both of these shows, you feel as if you know more about yourself and what you value most in life.  :) 
Both have as main theme the importance of family, especially the parenthood. How both shows portray the way of the main characters of fighting to grow up a child is superb in their own way, while Clannad: After Story is extremely dramatic and a truly masterpiece, in contrast with the kind slice of life pacing of Usagi Drop.Remember to watch Clannad first. 
DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED CLANNAD: AFTER STORYIf you liked the last part of Clannad after the turning point, you will really like Usagi drop. The entire anime is about the interactions of the two characters in a unique way for most anime. However for the most part where Clannad had a heavy sense of regret and sadness in it, Usagi Drop is much more light hearted, although still relatively serious discussing some topics about how children treat each other, and later on how adults treat each other too. The specials weren't bad either, even though they were to short to get any real story or meaning into. They did give some happy scenes between the two main characters. read more 
Both the shows deals with an adult raising a child. While usagi drop is a light hearted show whereas clannad after story is very dark. The setting in clannad after story is different but the premise is same. But beware of you wish for an ending that feels good then don't watch clannad after story. The hardship faced by a working adult while raising a child is shown in both the anime's. 
The main focus of both shows involves family relationships, responsibilities, and wholesome moments. "
10162,457,3,"Similar simple art and animation, action progression is equally slow.There is no useless moves, actions, scenes. In both anime reactions of charachters are believable and it simply gives us similar feeling of well spent time after watching anime where there is actually almost nothing to complain about.  
Both are calm but with some spicy comedy anime. In Mushishi however, that comedy is weaker. It's more of a serious anime. 
Usagi Drop is about a thirty year old man named Daichi who goes to his grandfather's funeral, and learns that his grandfather had an illegitimate child named Rin, who's 5/6 years old. Due to the scandal Rin's existence would cause, none of the relatives want to take her in. Daichi, the kind-hearted soul that he is, agrees to take in Rin, much to his entire family's dismay, believing he'd be an incompetent parent and taking her in would bring shame upon the family. He does struggle with raising Rin, but he's up to the task of growing as a parental figure. Mushishi is about a nomadic traveller named Ginko. Ginko is a mushi master. Mushi are (mostly invisible) life forms that can be very harmful to humans or the land/object/host it occupies. Ginko travels, helping people who are affected by mushishi- a healer/exorcist, for lack of better terms. These shows have very different plots, but they're both slice of life with a slow but calming pace. Both talk about growing as a person, and finding their place in the world.  read more "
10162,9989,3,"After Anohana ended for Spring, I was heartbroken. I really missed this show. Then, the Summer animes started and Usagi Drop is a really good replacement for Anohana. Anohana is more about friendship, and Usagi Drop is more about family, but they are both shows with amazing relationships. They are both such cute shows with such beautiful meanings! If you loved Anohana, you will love Usagi drop! (or the other way around) They both are such amazing shows! *o* 
Both want to be good drama shows, full of real life situations, and both fail in the process. Usagi is better than Ano Hi. Both are boring and overhyped.  
The main object is the family. From AnoHana we get the perception that it's not my father and mother or my brother my only and truly family. The definition of family can change according to our life history, our past...Usagi Drop brings us that. A new definition of family.

Usagi Drop reminded me too much of all the seasons of Natsume Yuujinchou.Both series have a similar atmosphere, with beautiful scenes and fantastic music that makes each episode very enjoyable.In terms of content, human themes are well achieved. If you liked one, you will like the other one "

Although displaying a different kind of relationship, Usagi Drop has very similar tropes. More realistic but enchanting in its own way, Usagi Drop is another heart warming story of the development of unconditional love. "

The story is set were the characters needs to confront their pasts to face reality and move forward into the future. They are both very emotional and strong stories.and they both are about lose, so its pretty easy to put your self in the Main character's Position and get hit directly by the feel train and even shed a tear ~  
In both anime the cast must confront their pasts to face reality and move forward into the future. 
Both are touching stories about growing up and having to deal with real issues. Both will also rip you apart emotionally. Wonderful soundtracks too. 
This anime is about music and romance. The main character, Arima Kosei, struggles with his life as a middle age student. He was consent with his life, until one day, one girl, Miyazono Kaori, changed everything. I recommend watching this anime if you watched Ano Hana, because the main characters are similar to one another and how they both have someone supporting them. Especially the ending for both animes.   
Your Lie in April is basically Anohana's second coming, having both done by A-1 Pictures and both having the intention of ripping your heart out in pieces. One thing that both shows share is that there is a good portion of the story being about the childhood of the characters, and even the conflict on both shows started in their childhood. But what separates them from each other is Your Lie in April is more on music while Anohana is more on childhood nostalgia.My personal preferences: If you're a person who've watched Your Lie in April first and is going to watch Anohana, I prefer you watch in a minimum of 1 episode per day. Because Anohana is a show that will do everything in it's power to make you cry in every episode it has. Granted, it's shorter (11 episodes) so it's kinda understandable. Some of you might be fine with that but in my own experience, I didn't cry as much as other people did because I watched it in one sitting and when a dramatic scene does come in an episode, I just feel numb because I'm still not over about the dramatic scene in an episode prior. read more

Did you cry while watching ""The Flower We Saw That Day""? Do you enjoy anime that make you cry? Are you a masochist? So am I. Your Lie in April, just like The Flower We Saw That Day, will make you cry (unless you're a cold heartless bastard). Your Lie in April is the journey a boy makes, with the help of a pretty classmate, to overcome his depression and continue to play piano after his mother/piano teacher passed away from an illness. Similarities between the two anime are: Great Animations/Graphics, music that can make a grown man cry, and a stellar voice acting cast. Even though being short, one season anime (Your Lie in April being longer), they had surprisingly satisfying (and depressing) endings. TL;DR: Watch Your Lie in April. read more

- Both anime revolve around an MC who has trouble letting go of the past.- Both anime attempt to communicate powerful messages with their story.- There is more depth in many characters than what initially meets the eye within both of the shows. 
*Spoiler*Ano Hana is yet another one similar to Shigatsu as in the male protagonist meets someone who's known them from the past and is their first love. 
Love triangle - check.Death of significant someone changing MC's life - check.Plot to rehabilitate one's self - check.Feels - definitely check.Bonus: Both are from the same studio. 
The vibe of the anime is similar, and so is the overall theme of the anime. 
An emotional ride. A character-driven story of overcoming trauma and coming to terms with oneself.  
THEY BOTH RIPPED MY HEART INTO MILLION PIECES.REWATCH IT ALMOST DOZEN OF TIME YET I AM STILL CRYING. 
While their main story is different from each other, their similarity lies in that both have main characters who are burdened with their past as they try to face forward to a better future. Another thing is that you'll be bombarded by a variety of feels as you learn more about the characters and story. There are also the love triangle aspect that brings out drama. 
Both series are absolutely fantastic dramas that feature wonderful characters. If you are looking for a beautiful anime that will bring tears to your eyes like Shigatsu wa Kimi noUso, then this is a perfect choice.  
Both have amazing intro and outro, with the portrayal of each character and their personality. Final episode is said to be the climax where the tittle only make sense after watching it and tears will be dropped, supposedly.Also, both will show you how hidden feelings and emotions can make you feel warm inside and yet to be filled with regrets. It's a play on secrets and drama of a few teenagers with their own story to tell. 
Both the animes are brilliantly executed. I literally cried at the end of both show. But I was more than satisfied with everything shows had to offer. I had a great time watching them. Highly Recommended to every anime lover. 
Its both about characters learning to move with their lives and connecting with someone on borrowed time. 
If you want an emotional ride that will surely make you cry, you can find that in both of these anime. Both these anime tell very touching and heartbreaking stories. Both these shows know how to use music in an effective way to trigger emotion. Being very similar shows is why if you like Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai, I would recommend watching Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso. 
 I would recommend Your lie in April. Why it's because not only this was my first ever anime. This anime will make the person whoever I recommended it to create an attachment with the characters and story to the point that they will have feelings at the end of it. After watching this, they will want to consume more anime to fill in the void that this anime created to them.Not only that, but this anime will teach them the lesson of healthy relationships and live life to the fullest. This is a great anime to start. It has all of the components to make you turn into an anime fan.To the music, characters, and story. This anime will make you hook in to look for more animes. Knowing that these different components make a good anime. read more 
They are both about losing a loved one and trying to find inner peace with each other before they go. Both are pretty hard tearjerkers, too. 
If you like tearing to death with anime, this one is for you. 
Both of these animes are about friendship and dealing with loss. If you watched anohana because you're a fan of animes that will make you sob, then your lie in April should definitely be next on your to-watch list. "
9989,4181,35,"Both will make you cry with their tales of love and loss. With the help of a supernatural force, the characters learn to cope with their grief and accept the fate of their situations. 
I have a feeling that Ano Hana is like Clannad in the making. Maybe the atmosphere they give off? Anyway, both are awesome (so far Ano Hana is doing good). Quite the drama too. And yeah, both have deaths in it.  
Both stories involve strong romance and friendship. They'll rip out your heart, throw it against the wall, and step on it without giving you the chance to grab the box of tissues. And it will probably do it several times. If you like one, you'll like the other. Just be sure to have the box of tissues ready beforehand.  
When watching Ano Hana, it gave off the same atmosphere as After Story. They both involve a group of friends and love between two that ends tragically. There is a lot of drama in both and they will also make you cry. Ano Hana was the only anime too make me cry since I watched After Story, and that was a couple years ago. They are both amazing shows that will captivate you to want more because you finished them in a day. 
Both of these anime unlocked the gate to my eternal manly feels. If you love a good old masculine cry, then these two anime are similar in that aspect. I suggest you do not watch Clannad: After Story before watching Clannad, so if you want a small one-night feels anime, watch Ano Hana. Both of these anime intentionally make the audience cry. If you bottle up your feels, you may find trouble enjoying either of these.  
Dramatic plot development that feature friendship, family, using a small bit of supernatural plot device. You will undoubtedly encounter some intense catharsis along the way of watch both.  
Lemme get one thing straight. Clannad After Story and AnoHana (abbreviation) will make you cry your little anime-loving eyes out just by how good story is.Now here are some examples why they are similar:1. Drama Lots and lots of DRAMA. Yup.2. The Atomosphere You have a kinda heavy atomosphere that gets light hearted at some points.3. Friends  Friends are not as close as they are after an event. 
They're both deal with some type of loss and the struggles that come with it. Anohana will definitely have an impact on you mentally and physically, that is if you do start bawling.  Also, the concept of strengthening their bonds  with one another is definitely there. Oh, but I  personally believe that anohana  gives a bigger impact than  clannad. 
Well first of all, they both made me really sad and teary ;~;.They both involve death, and love. They also have a triangle relationship between the main character, his lover, and his childhood friend. (Sorry, not really accurate! Trying to not give spoilers). They both have fantastic artwork. They are both rated 10/10 in my personal anime list!If you enjoyed Clannad I'm sure you'd love AnoHana.  
Clannad Afterstory is the sequel (second season) of Clannad. What makes it similar to Ano Hana is that they both utilize drama and emotions to their fullest potential. These are tales of love and family, friendship and loss, that will take you on a roller coaster of emotions as you walk with the characters from the first episode to the last. Both shows utilize their soundtracks and music super well to support particular scenes appropriately and to convey a message. There are also minor touches of the supernatural used to support the story, yet make the shows unique in their own ways. These are both shows that I wish I can re-watch from scratch without any memory of it! Because the journey was simply phenomenal and once-in-a-lifetime like!  read more 
For me, at least, the only downside to Clannad: After Story was that is did indeed have to come to an end, leaving a void that simply could not be filled by lighter-hearted fair. Anohana was the show that broke the Post-Clannad void for me. I can sincerely recommend both shows for anyone with the desire to cry literal buckets of tears (unless your heart is a brick). 
Though this story is rather different from Clannad. It has the same level of emotion. I'd say it's like as if someone where to condense Clannd into 11 episodes, it would give you Anohana. It's basically a story about Friendship, rather than Romance, which, I feel touches a wider audience, and the backlash of losing something (or someone -spoliers-) who you hold dear. After watching Clannad, and you feel like finding an anime to fill in that void, look no further, because Anohana, WE FOUND YOU! 
both stories about friendship and relationships that will have you tearing up. 
Both anime have a very strong sense of drama, and both stories feature an exceptional power to hit the viewer in the feelings. They can make you laugh, smile, and cry - as you find yourself to be in an emotional rollercoaster. You will probably cry watching both shows. 
good anime about life, friendship, and love.focused on one male lead charter who helps his female lead character.both anime has a great set of supporting cast of friends to help the lead charters develop, while they themselves develop in the process. 
If you feel a empty place in your heart after Clannad After Story and you're looking to fill that place with an anime that will gave you the same feeling then I can only think of one anime that's on the same level: Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai. Even if at first they give a different impression, both series explore similar themes like family, friendship, loss and forgiveness and they're more related that you'd think. 
Same feels and void to both anime. Impeccable character development to a very 'human' cast. In both series the protagonist is a generally unhappy person, whether its because he has lost someone, or he is generally unhappy with his life. Finally, they both have supernatural elements, which influences the story. 
Both are tearjerkers.Both are tragic love stories full loss. Supernatural forces are involved as the main character struggles to deal with the pain. Both shows are absolute masterpieces, Clannad is longer and has more development whereas Anohana is short but doesn't fail to make you cry. If you like one, you will love the other. 
Both shows will hit you at an emotional level. I'd recommend Clannad to anyone, but I can only recommend Anohana if you have a very high tolerance for overdone melodrama. If you like your drama to have a sense of reality and elegance instead of having the show shove obnoxious and unjustified crying down your throat, then I would not recommend it. If you just want to turn your brain off and enjoy good animation, amazing music (especially the ending theme like oh my god it's so good), and formulaic tugs at your heart strings, then I highly recommend Anohana. 
Both have emotional stories and while at first, they both have unrelatable characters turn out to be really good and highly memorable. Both will have tear-jerking moments. This may be a controversial comment, but I cried more for Anohana, and unlike the Clannad series where you have to go through 44 episodes, Anohana only takes 11, so it is at least worth the watch. 
-Both are really emotional-Will hit you in the feels-Satisfying ending 
if you are looking for a anime that will make you cry both of these are perfect for you. 
How did your Tears Taste? Good? Want to try some more? You do? Watch this one :3. 
These are two relaxing slice of life with fantasy & reincarnate. 
Clannad: After Story and Anohana are both very emotional anime's.  They are both in the genre of slice of life.  The characters in each deal with happiness, confusion and loss.  They can be very exciting and happy at times and at other times it is extremely sad.   There is death in each anime where the other characters have to learn how to deal with their deaths.  They go through Denial, Anger, Depression, and Acceptance.  I believe that these anime's are very similar and if you liked one of these you should try watching the other.  They are both very good anime's. read more 
Both shows show off massive loss, probably made a lot of people who watched it cry as well as featuring great developed characters and good relationships.....Did I mention the potential crying? 
Both focus on the hardships of the main characters, and both are slices-of-life that will play with your feelings.  
If Clannad: After Story had you in tears like me and you're looking for something else to crush your feelings look no further than AnoHana. A memorable tale of friendship and romance that vividly highlights the struggles of getting over the death of a childhood friend, and how it can affect the lives of everyone they knew. Very touching and twice as beautiful if you can relate to the feeling of loosing a close friend... 
Both of these series will make you cry like a baby that is really all you need to know. If you need a anime to fill the void from Clannad watch this. You wont be disappointed. 
If you want to sweat through the eyes kkkkk, these animes is what you are looking for. Beautiful, exciting stories that tinker with your emotional. 
They both have two of the best dramas stories ever made, in my opinion; I would certainly recommend these two excellent works !! 
This series really make you crying especially endingHave supernatural genre 
-DRAMA/SUPERNATURAL Good combo-Both got strong romance and friendship-Both protagonists had been forced to accept the fate of one character-Crazy good climax scene on both anime-Clannad:AS require you to watch the first one to get the maximum output of the scene significantly while anohana are easier to watch but it's not as good as clannad:AF ( but it's still good ) 
Anohana and Clannad share the same type of sad feel because as well as sadness and despair, there are important morals along the way.  
I f you want to watch some heart-warming yet tear-jerker romance anime like anohana, Clannad: After story is the one for you. "
9989,28851,20,"Group of friends torn apart by some event that happens in their childhood.Both story are focus around the female lead that was unintentionally responsible for these events and follows the characters in their journey to fixing the relationship of the group 
Koe no Katachi and AnoHana share similar character traits and senarios. Each series revolves around a group of 'friends' who have cut ties since childhood and brings them together again. These two series also have similar main characters, male lead with a serious disconnect from the real world and a tragic female lead. You get a similar feeling while watching both these series, they're very emotional and dramatic. If you have seen one I would highly recommend checking out the other for a similar story and emotional expierence. 
I got very strong AnoHana vibes when watching Koe no Katachi. Both shows deal with a group of childhood friends who become distant after some incidents in the past, and how they restore their friendship when they meet again in the future.  
Both anime center on a teenage boy who suffers from guilt after a traumatic event in his past and seeks some form of reconciliation and redemption for his actions. Both anime also devote considerable time to that boy's group of childhood friends and how they too have to deal with their own personal demons stemming from that event. Lastly, both anime are very effective tearjerkers. 
These anime share that theme of teenagers struggling to overcome a dark event from their past, for one.But mostly, I got a really similar feel from Jinta's and Shoya's characters and how they were affected by their individual tragedies. They both start out as confident, outgoing little boys-- the ringleaders of their groups of friends. ...And then grow up to be really withdrawn and insecure. It was one of the most striking elements of A Silent Voice for me, and though the focus on that element in Jinta's story is a little more subtle, it's definitely there and reminded me a lot of Shoya.  
It's a tear-jerking story about group of friends falling apart. 
Both are amazing tearjerkers, as they succeed on delivering an emotional roller coaster up until the very end. 
KnK and AnoHana work under the similar backdrop of a melodramatic story about a group of people's childhoods and how their guilt and hidden emotions against each other have caused life-changing scenarios for all of them—and how their coming to terms with their past allows them to move on a new chapter in their lives. 
Watching Koe no Katachi, I couldn't help but notice the remarkable similarities to Anohana. The stories revolve around characters initially as young children when an incident breaks their fragile realities tearing friendships and livelihoods alike apart at the seams. Further, they have a similar time skip from elementary to high school to explore how the characters changed overtime and how the past has affected them. In the end, both are about the perils of life and growing up. There are consequences for every action and life isn't nearly as simple as it was when you were a child. Communication might appear to be a simple task but even as we grow in age expressing emotions and words is arduous and full of unexpected complexities. We all experience pain and the journey to conquer it and redeem our mistakes is at the root of both tales. read more 
This anime shows the fragility of a person will to live, mainly on adolescence, when compelled to deal with the feelings of others. 
a heartfelt reunion to heal from the past 
""A Silent Voice"" is everything I wanted anohana to be.a well-written story about social anxiety, depression and let it the past go...if you are interested in well-written dramas, this is for you (It's also better than 13 reasons why) 
The heroine of the story is a pity girls who are sad, this story revolves around the past and trying to fix them in their teen age when the main character got reunited with the heroine. These two anime are trying to teach us lessons that we shouldn't hurt others. 
Both explore the impact of childhood trauma (death in the case of anohana and bullying in the case of koe no katachi) and moving on from the past. Additionally, both have romantic elements (more so in anohana).  
These animes surprisingly have a lot in common. Both of them deal with childhood trauma and observe the regathering of childhood friends to form strong bonds once again. While these two are quite different (and Silent Voice is ten times better), they still have similarities that will give you certain vibes, but won't make you feel at all like you're watching the same anime. They take different turns but both have finales based around similar concepts. They are, however, quite different. So don't expect them to be super similar. 
Both involve a past incident that defines the current MC. Both are also heavily emotional and tearjerking. Both have social narratives that are much relevant to us today. 
You want to know how to settle up with your ""old friends""?Both have the same situation, where you and your childhood friends grown apart because an accident. 
Both has somewhat similar characters, coming of age, and friends drifting apart.  
Both types of anime solve problems about friendship, jealousy and being together with old friends. Both animations have exciting animations, and have a beautiful meaning too!  
they gave me the same vibe when I watched them, I really think you would like this if you enjoyed Anohana "
9989,31043,15,"Both of them have a main character who regrets a certain thing that happened in their childhood involving a girl, and they both try to ""fix"" it. Both of them are dramatic, thrilling, psychological and emotional. AnoHana and Erased have brilliant directing and production, they have the same director, stunning visuals, detailed backgrounds and some hidden stuff in their op and ed, and they're both made by A-1 pictures. 
Both of them involve revolving around the childhood of the MC, and a little girl/childhood friend. Both are quite emotional and touching~Both have phenomenal soundtracks and great visuals, along with superb narration and directing. Both have really good OPs and EDs as well. 
Both of these anime involve childhood friendships, death in a small group of young kids, and supernatural elements such as time travel or a ghost. both are extremely emotional and touching. 
>Both involve little kids and their relationship>Both are really dramatic 
- Death. Dealing with the deaths. Aftermaths of deaths.- A group of childhood friends. In Erased, the friends are mostly seen in in their childhood-form whereas in AnoHana it switched between childhood memories and the current highschoolers.- Male MC who is more or less a loner at the start solving the puzzles/finding closure.- Emotionally rich works with lots of drama. 
Honestly I feel the need to reccomend this and Steins;Gate together. If There were an anime with the story of Steins;Gate, and the characters of Anohana, then ERASED is it. If you like ERASED, you will love these two. 
Both are series that explore the past and the results of a traumatic childhood event. Animation is very similar and while watching the series it often reminded me of Ano Hana. Characters in Boku Dake ga Inai Machi are much more fleshed out in my opinion.  
The story, the characters and even the opening of Ano Hana is similar to Boku Dake. Besides they are both very engaging and dramatized. 
+ Both are series that explore the past and the results of a traumatic childhood+ Character designs is somewhat similar...(eyes)+ Both of these anime are emotional...really...+ Both have amazing visuals/ost's...+ Both are made by A-1 Pictures / both has similar genres as well...- (just Jintan from AnoHana is so damn annoying, unlike Satoru) 
The main protagonist have a supernatural based issue helping them with a situation involving a childhood friend who was killed. Boku Dake is more of a thriller/mystery show while AnoHana is more of a emotional piece. Both however are well directed and have beautiful animation. Definitely would recommend both to watch! 
In both series an introverted Main Character is forced to confront major events from his childhood in order to make a better future for himself. The main difference is that in Ano Hana, Jinta must overcome his grief at losing a dear friend in Menma in order to rebuild his own life, whereas Satoru goes directly back in time to stop the death of a girl in his class named Kayo Hinazuki. 
Both have great drama story and plot. These anime stories revolve around someone that isn't actually part of their time and is living in another time, either future or past. I highly recommend AnoHana to those who liked ERASED and vice versa because of their great story, drama and especially their tear-jerking plot.  
Both theses animes will hit you the feels if you want that then I suggest a watch. 
-I got the same feeling when watching both of these shows.-Both are about a young girl that died in the past. 
Its really similar pace wise yet it is more on the thriller side of things.  "

Both stories are about one special girl and how an event on one summer day leaves a lasting effect on her family and friends, for years to come. There's the main character who holds the girl's affections, the boy who can only watch in envy, and the girl who always feels like she's in the shadow of that special girl. Add to it feelings of regret and guilt, wishes, and dreams, you get two great slice of life, coming of age stories. 
one has baseballone has ghostsother than that, they're kind of the same. 
They both have stories that kind of center on the male protagonist's deceased childhood friend/girlfriend, and both give off the same kind of feeling. 
Even though Cross Game is about baseball the underlying themes are similar to Ano Hana. Also some plot elements are very similar between the 2 series. 
Both anime are very similar. strong bond between childhood friends, having one special girl in their childhood, and making her last dream come true. the difference is that Anohana with ghost but no baseball while Cross Game with baseball but no ghost (or at least it's left to the viewer's interpretation) 
I only recommend these two for each other based on a single similarity ...but it is a very striking similarity both shows carry. Both deal with childhood friends and death, and both also show the gradual reconciliation of feelings toward the dead and coming to terms with it. Both are also very sweet and extremely sad. So I only recommend one for the other if you saw one and enjoyed the parts dealing with the dead and the romance with the shows.Otherwise, the shows are pretty different. CG is slower paced and about baseball while Anohana is about a group of friends who have broken apart. read more 
3 of the 6 main characters are the same seiyuu in Cross Game.The interactions of characters and underlying story are similar except Cross game has an added sport and competitive element. 
Both series adapts a similar tone of story telling involving a young girl who was once a special person (childhood friend) in the main protagonist's life. They have a lighthearted atmosphere that follows a sort of slice of life adaptation.Both series has theme of friendship involving the main protagonist and the other characters he has interactions with.

If you want to cry again, I'd strongly recommend this anime.(Plus, they have the same character designer).

Anohana is more about friendship, and Usagi Drop is more about family, but they are both shows with amazing relationships. They are both such cute shows with such beautiful meanings! If you loved Anohana, you will love Usagi drop! (or the other way around) They both are such amazing shows! *o* 
Both want to be good drama shows, full of real life situations, and both fail in the process. Usagi is better than Ano Hi. Both are boring and overhyped.  
The main object is the family. From AnoHana we get the perception that it's not my father and mother or my brother my only and truly family. The definition of family can change according to our life history, our past...Usagi Drop brings us that. A new definition of family. A girl that will live with a guy that means nothing to her in the beggining but that will change with the time and wich will become her ""Family""! "

both have multiple love interests but still having a decidedly ""obvious pick"", both have some sort of aspect that's.. well sort of happening because of the character's emotions at the current time, the puberty effect and the ghost. Both are also quite short.

Alot of people have situations that are hard to deal with in life. If you want the type of anime that hits you where it hurts with feels 3-gatsu no lion will do that. Like Anohana, 3-gatsu no lion build up their characters in a really realistic way in terms of personality traits developed by their surroundings i.e. how they're treated and more. Although 3-gatsu no lion looks like another one of those ""I'm about a game"" type of animes' in this case shogi, it talks more about the character's everyday development and pulls you in by making you want to know what happens to the protagonist so much that you'll want to binge it all.Side-note :Initially I wasn't all that compelled to watch 3-gatsu no lion thinking it was another its gonna be all about shogi type of anime but I was browsing and decided to give it a try and I truly got really invested in the story.

Porter Robinson, who wrote Shelter, listed Anohana as one of his top favorite anime. It's easy to see the similarities in the two. Both are about loss and hope. Both are huge tearjerkers. A-1 studios made both, so they are definitely similar in terms of artwork. 
The amazing graphics and images are really good in both of these ""animes"" (I do not consider shelter as being only a music). Both of they are really realted to love and needing to save someone. Both can make you cry.Shelter is also related to ghost in the shell and animatrix. "
9989,9253,2,"It's a surprise this isn't within the top recommendations. The art style is similar, creating an environment of surreal and  realism at the same time. Main characters are similar, with both main lead male roles fighting desperately against fate for the person they care about. Menma= MayuriDaru= HasidaAnju= Kurisu 
They are similar in that they show a look and the character's psyche/mental state. "
9989,457,2,"They both involve people who can see spirits. 
Similar melancholic mood with a supernatural twist and slow moving pace.  "
9989,4081,2,"Both lead characters (Natsume and Jinta) are able to see spirits, in Jinta's case its only Menma. Both are slice of life/dramas, but AnoHana is much more of a tear-jerker.  
if you like this, i'd recommend Natsume Yuujinchou.+drama, supernatural, friendship and love.might think, omg youkais?? this must be scary show!!fear not! it's not dark at all, instead it's warm :) "
2251,1,30,"Both of them are themed around Jazz and Blues. Both animes display alot of martial arts and gunplay. Definetily check out Baccano! if you loves Cowboy Bebop! 
The style is very similar. It has a very jazzy feel to it that fits with the show like it did with Cowboy Bebop. The characters are so loveable and unique and so different from one another like the people on Bebop. Not to mention the soundtracks have a similar feel to them. 
Baccano! is a strangely underappreciated show that has a huge cast of good characters, a compelling plot drawn from the ample source material, a soundtrack that complements the show well, action, comedy, drama, intrigue...If you appreciated what Cowboy Bebop had to offer then you'll find a lot to like in Baccano!. It's a show with definite rewatch value. 
Bebop and Baccano! are all about style. It’s the thirties: tommy guns, stars from black-and-white movies and jazz. Bebop is more like blues with its sadness and noir films features. Baccano! is a jazz like it was in really beginning, totally improvisation. You don’t know what will happen next. Great cocktail from retro, detective stories, comedy, cruelty and heartbreaks. Both these series was inspired by films like “The Godfather”, “The Untouchables” and so on. You’ll find crime families and gangland killing, fire-fights and pursuits, maniacs and comedy characters in Bebop and Baccano!Soundtrack is also magnificent, when I watched Baccano! it was like I’ve met a Yoko Kanno’s genius work for Bebop one more time. Although storytelling is extremely different, for Bebop it’s a story per episode, Baccano! is a mosaic from plotlines that fully combined, they are really similar. You'll share an entire range of emotions with each character and find that these creations are somehow cast in the same mold. read more 
Funky, badass, amazing anime with great action, animation, and music.Both have possibly the greatest characters cast ever seen.In both series you’ll find awesome fight scenes (both martial arts fights & gunfights), mafia, an immortal shota boy (Czes in Baccano, Wen in CB), and comedy despite the violence and mature contents.Both are anime that you can rewatch again and again without getting tired of them. 
the feel of these anime's is failry similar, they both are ""western"" anime and there is also a similarity in the music styles, they both also have extraordinary dubs i would go as far as to recommend the dub over the sub because it actually sounds more natural but both are great animes and should be given watch 
Both Baccano! and Cowboy Bebop have excellent visuals, jazz on the soundtrack, high-intensity fight sequences, and likable characters. 
Same kind of show : you'll find the best OST in both (jazzy, really cool), same spirit/atmosphere with really great characters/action you will enjoy all the show without any moment of boring !! I guarantee you'll not be disappointed !! 2 must-see. 
Both shows have the same tone and similar style, both have great action scenes and cool characters. 
Both have intense combat sequences that aren't just limited to hand-to-hand.While Cowboy Bebop's actual plot isn't thoroughly developed. Baccano's is highly incomprehensible until the very end.Both have great, memorable characters, dubs that fit the era, music that fits the scenes, and an enjoyment factor that skyrockets! 
Cowboy Bebop and Baccano! have a jazz filled soundtrack, slick, fluid, and detailed animation, and are bitter sweet series. 
As an anime viewer, you might be lucky enough to eventually stumble upon unforgettably great anime at one point or another. I'm here to tell you of two such anime: Baccano!, a tale of immortals and the mafia gang, and Cowboy Bebop, the journey of a former syndicate-turned-bounty-hunter.  Baccano! and Cowboy Bebop share the same atmosphere, fluid animation and clever dialogue. They are western-styled and contain lots of references to western cultures. Furthermore, the two are immensely entertaining and enjoyable anime that will keep your attention the whole journey through and leave you breathless. While Baccano! is more of a different-plots-intricately-woven-into-a-great-story kind of anime and Cowboy Bebop is more episodic, there is no doubt that if you enjoy one, you will most certainly enjoy the other.  read more 
Both have an americian cast of characters, are full of action, particualrly involving gangsters and just a general sense of coolness about them that sets them apart from other anime 
Jazz, Style, Class, Crime, Action, Drama, Romance, Comedy, Wacky characters, Psychotic characters, Mysterious characters, Smooth characters, Hand to Hand Combat, Shootouts, Oldschool feelCowboy Bebop and Baccano! are the kings of cool when it comes to anime. They both feel more like movies than actually animes and even though, each one does it differently, they both use multiple stories to tell one big story, giving you pieces of the puzzle until the end when it all comes togetherThey both also make great additions to what I like to call the ""Jazzy Crime Anime"" trilogy which includes Cowboy Bebop, Baccano!, and Lupin The 3rd.They both certainly have their differences but there's no denying that they both go great hand and hand with each other. After watching both, you're gonna wanna go out, buy a nice suit, learn martial arts and get into gunfights. Both of them are 10/10 masterpieces, check them out. Oh and they both have fantastic dubs that are more fitting than the sub versions because of how Westernized the two shows are read more 
Both of them heavily influenced on American culture and have the vintage/retro style. Especially choice of soundtracks are very similiar, jazz and blues mostly. They both have smooth/charismatic characters like in Quentin Tarantino movies with their witty and badass dialogues.  
Both have the same jazzy, easy come, easy go attitude and a very lovable and energetic cast composed of gangsters, gunslingers, and silver-tongued thieves. 
Both anime have great jazz soundtracks. Jazz music is almost exclusively used in both anime. The openings of both anime is really popular precisely because of their upbeat, jazzy music.Also, both anime have a lot of melee combat. 
1: AWESOME FIGHT SCENES!2: Both have really good character development3: Jazzy feeling (best way I can describe it)    
If you liked the jazzy element to Cowboy Bebop, you'll definitely like this! 
Both contain an outstanding jazz/blues style soundtrack, and also contain a decent amount of action involving both guns and fists. They also have a cast of unique and compelling characters that all get at least a little development (though the main character cast of Baccano! is much bigger, despite being shorter). Both also have excellent English dubs, a possible persuasion for those who may predominantly prefer subs. 
They have similar music styles throughout the shows, both having one of the best opening songs I've ever heard. Both have a lot of violence and shooting. They both have awesome characters as well. They both have multiple stories being shown that tangle up for the final outcome. Also they both have something about organized crimes.  
They are both rule of cool shows, with Baccano being more over the top and having supernatural aspects to it.In terms of story Baccano is far more impressive by having multiple random events being interwoven and connecting with each other by the 13th episode. Bebop is episodic so it tells a different story in each episode.In terms of Art and Animation. Baccano looks more realistic and it is more detailed than Bebop, but Bebop is prettier to look at and it has a more original art style. Bebop also inches ahead in terms of animation by being more fluid while being a much older and longer show.In terms of characters they are equal. Baccano has a much larger as but doesn't get nearly as much development as Bebop. While Bebop has a smaller cast that is just as enjoyable but also gets development. read more 
Baccano! and Cowboy Bebop have a very similar cool and jazzy atmosphere. The music and intros of both shows are also similar; both intros are swingy jazz tunes. Both these shows are specifically great for western audiences, and they both have superb English dubs. 
Are you ready for special dangerous parties? Be alive.Both main organizations are gangster. Extremely humorous and enjoyable. Coolness and action-packed.OP songs are very similar. It's jazz. Baccano! has vocal version. This one also great.Spike and Issac can share similar personalities. They have very positive thinking and lucky things.I can't write more both characters similarities because too big cast. Nevertheless, favorites are many.CB is more longer, serious plot and ultra dramatic. Baccano! has some bloody scenes and complex settings.Both are really amazing classics. I love both of them so much. Worth watching if you prefer gunman style. 
Just like Bebop, Baccano's fight scenes are primarily with guns and hand to hand combat. Baccano provides likable characters and great character development. It has the same Jazz music that lends itself magnificently to the atmosphere of the series, and gives the viewer what Bebop did not for the majority of the series, a plot. Albeit the plot is almost impossible to understand until you progress into the series, it is expanded upon gradually throughout each episode.  
Both have jazz and music like that but also center around gun fighting and martial arts 
If you are a fan of ""Baccano!"" then you know what good story telling is.  You understand pacing, timing, character development, and solid endings.  ""Cowboy Bebop"" also embodies the qualities that make up a masterpiece, and ""Baccano!"" is a masterpiece in it's own right.  
Both have a good jazz soundtrack, they both have amazing fight scenes and they both have unbelevibale dubs. 
If you're looking for great fighting scenes with a little bit of jazz playing in the background, look no further than Baccano! for your next anime fix. Much like Cowboy Bebop, this show also has a lot of action-packed scenes and is also placed in 1930's Chicago, so you know the music is pretty good. Szilard and his aide, Ennis, are looking for the missing bottles that contain the elixir of immortality, but there's also a lot going on in the background—like mafia wars, for example. The alchemists are on a road to find out the true price for immortality.  
Both being the best anime which contains jazz and have fun characters with alot of mayhem except some moments in cowboy bebop where it gets slightly darker. Don't forget their op's. "
2251,5114,14,"Surely both series do share a big part together which is the alchemy.Alchemy and all its related things: immortal beings, legends, immortality elisir/philosophical stone and so on.Both stories evolve around the same epoch (first years of 1900) and share amazing main characters.Even if, the style to tell the stories is very different, they both still share a very good music theme as well.If you enjoyed one I'm sure you'll like the other too! I can definitely affirm that both of them are masterpieces. 
Both deal with immortality, an all-cure elixir, and alchemy. Both are great anime with unique and wonderful characters, great animation, very well done fights, and violence & blood scenes. The first thing that comes to my mind when I watch Baccano! is FMA brotherhood. ;) 
Both involve people using alchemy in order to perpetuate their existence, as well as having some crazy stuff thrown in. 
Baccano is more similar to FMAB then any other anime, whenever I watch it I think of FMAB, D. Gray man might have one or two aspects but baccano has dozens of aspects that are similar to FMAB, if you like FMAB you will like baccano, it is stupid that people say you will like Blue Exorcist if you liked FMAB just cause both the main characters have brothers. That doesn't mean it is similar! just one little thing that won't affect your liking of a series! Baccano is a must watch if you if you like FMAB. 
I found them similar because both of them have things about alchemy, but Baccano is a bit more mature and has some gore in it. 
If you liked the whole mystery and conspiracy feeling in Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, than you will like Baccano!Also, both anime have beautiful fight scenes with lots of blood, and extremely badass characters which add a massive amount of excitement to the show.Not to mention both have alchemists, immortals, homunculi, and are based around the same time era of the 1930s.So if you liked one of these anime, I highly recommend trying the other. 
Τhey are both about alchemy ,they both have a huge amount of great characters and great production values too .For a first eye they dont look alike but if you think it a bit they have many things in common 
Large cast of likable characters plus alchemy. Plus both have hilarious comic relief seamlessly woven in-between the serious scenes. 
Both animes share a big part which is alchemy: immortality, legends, elixirs etc. Both of them have amazing characters(main and supporting), a stunning plot/story and of course, spectacular animation/soundtracks. Each and every episode is a huge mystery and it's impossible for you to stop watching. Finally, these two series are some of the masterpieces Japan has to offer. 
both series deals with the concept of alchemy and immortality. both series are extremely epic. 
If you're interested in alchemy or homunculi these are both must watch anime. If you liked one chances are you'll enjoy the other as well although they are quite different in a lot of aspects.  
Similarities:- Both deal with immortality- Baccano has alchemy in it also- Homunculus exists for both- Mystery element- Alot of work with the plot- Violence- has comedic moments and serious momentsDifferences:- Baccano story is scrambled- Full Metal story is more straight foward in terms of plot- Characters are pretty different, no similar ones 
There's a reason why FMA:B and Baccono! are my two favorite series. I'm a sucker for a good story and it is done so so well with both of them. How? Well:-Continuity! Every plot point is relevant, characters are not thrown away, and there are no ass-pulls. The plot is well thought out, with tons of twists and turns that are surprising, yet understandable when you look back on the clues.-Alchemy also plays an important role in Baccano! with an event in the 1700's acting as a catalyst to the main story. Not gunna say more cuz spoilers.-Both involve weird immortality.-BADASS characters.-Brings up interesting philosophical issues.Also, if you like the setting in FMA:B:-It is similar to Baccano! (although Baccano! jumps around a lot chronologically, it mainly takes place in the early 1930's) with similar technology.  read more 
These two series share a fundamental element in their plot that is: Alchemy.Other than that, they both have an excellent cast of characters that makes them entertaining and memorable. "
2251,40052,6,"Both series feature entertaining and fast paced story where at one point everything just makes sense and it's just fun to watch. Great Pretender's build up is a lot faster than in Baccano and features more con men thief characters. Similar music style, especially the openings.  
Jazz never bored. As long as old people exist.Both are written about foreign mafia's slapstick stories. Atmospheres also very similar. Especially opening.Not only America but every foreign places are part of settings in both shows. Very intriguing.GP is more realistic. You can understand why GP is comedy in whole. Baccano! is darker and bloody.Both have powerful entertainment. GP is 2020 version of Baccano! IMO. I hope you love it. 
Have a very similar Tarantino esc like energy and the whole American criminal element is similarly mimickedExcept in Baccano it focuses on prohibition era New York instead the whole worldIt also has a similar Jazzy soundtrackIt obviously misses some of the hip hop tracks that Great Pretender uses but overall it's similarBasically if you like the pacing, energy and character focus of the series as well as the soundtrack you'll like BaccanoJust prepare for something more like Pulp Fiction instead of Jackie Brown with the story being told out of order 
Jazz & crimes goes together like macaroni & cheese. Baccano! and Great Pretender are both shows about criminals doing criminal things, but somehow they make it mesmerizing to watch. The two have have extremely original and well written casts that kind of makes you want to root for the ''bad guys''. Finally, they both have amazing soundtracks.  
-> Great ensemble cast in both series-> Jazzy openings-> Both are terrific crime-comedy dramas-> Baccano! is some weird combination of FMA:B, Steins;Gate, Pulp Fiction and Snatch-> Great Pretender is like Ocean's 11, but with more comedy 
Great pretender is a must watch anime for baccano! lovers , to know the reasons check other recommendations. "
2251,36649,6,"Both of them take place in America and revolve around mafia families and gunfights. Even though Baccano takes a more supernatural approach, they both give off similar mafia vibes. If you enjoyed watching Banana Fish, you should definitely check out Baccano as well. 
Banana fish and Baccano have american characters and show the life and the difficulties people in Mafia have to face. They re both very good. 
These two animes have the same setting, being America and they have tons of guns, killing and violence. Finally they have a small number of episodes. 
Same setting(New York, America) same atmosphere, both have guns and urban action in the cities as the main characters try to solve a mystery related to the past. 
Similar energy & universe : action and danger are proeminant but the tone is light and fun.  
Both are set in the U.S. and focus on topics such as gang violence.  "
2251,4282,4,"The only story of any kind I recollect seeing executed like the fifth Kara movie, where the events switch between past, present and future on the fly for mindfuck purposes, is Baccano. Neither of the stories when told in order are complex, and Baccano in particular is easy enough to follow as is if you pay attention, but they can give headaches due to the mindfuckery.Unlike Baccano, Kara 5 starts out totally linear, and stays that way for the first 40 minutes or so. Then, it proceeds to jump around like a rabbit on crack, and it left me pondering at the end whether I'd seen one of the best movies of all time or a movie executed in such a way that its flaws were well-hidden. Even without much understanding and a lot of confusion, it was totally gripping. read more 
Supernatural, magic and gore and both have a rather confusing storytelling. In both anime, the story is presented like a puzzle and you have an opening sequence where you see what is going to happen.  
Both masterfully employ non-linear narrative as a mystery/unexplained occurrence is slowly revealed as disjointed ""puzzle pieces"" fall into place throughout their stories. Dark atmospheres and palettes are typically used in both, though Baccano frequently provides comic relief whereas KnK seldom does. Nonetheless, fans of action will find plenty to like in both KnK 5 and Baccano, with both featuring top-notch, smoothly animated fights and occasionally over-the-top gore.  
When it comes down to the story telling, I noticed that it's similar to Baccano!'s style. The movie changes a lot between past and present, though the main difference between these two anime is that while watching Baccano!, you are still able to follow the story and get a clear picture of everything at the end. In Kara no Kyoukai 5, on the other hand, you will get utterly confused at some points of the movie, just wanting to shout out WTF!? "
2251,777,4,"Both are intensely bloody, using physical decapitations/trauma and psychological teasers that bring interest and diligence. Their story lines are similar in the aspects of immortality, violence, power, and interest. 
Baccano and Hellsing (ultimate) are both amazing seinen anime which revolve around supernatural beings and immortality. They contain a lot of action, blood, guns and amazing characters who will make you want them to succeed in what they're doing. Great anime to watch, both of them.  
Noise. Western setting in place of a more conventional eastern one. Glorification of violence. Overabundance of blood. Uncommon friendships and betrayals.  Unusually long life cycles. Overpowered eccentric males. Silent females who kick butt. Supernatural versus ordinary. Youth versus experience. Kick-ass English dubs which are arguably better than their original counterparts.  
While these shows have completely different premises, they both are filled with trigger-happy lunatics and some of the most memorable characters you will ever see in anime. Morals in both of these shows are very grey and there is blood galore! So if you're looking for a insane, bloody, action fest with supernatural elements, look no further than either of these shows. "
2251,5081,3,"These are for people who can really enjoy an artful story. These are both quite unique anime.The only real similarities between these involve immortality, but they play into the stories in very different ways. 
This one may be a stretch, but if you like a different form of story telling, these are for you. Baccano and Bakemonogatari feature several stories on different characters and make everything connect as it proceeds through the story. 
Immortality plays a prominent role in both series, albeit shown though their own methods. While the two are very different kinds of shows, neither tell their stories in traditional manner. Instead they are disjointed and fragmented, but done in a way that actively encourages the viewer to piece it all together. "
2251,9253,2,"While Baccano is not about time travel, I feel that people who enjoy Steins;gate should try out Baccano. It is bloodier than Steins;gate, but full of mystery and you get the thrill of understanding more and more each episode. Once you finish the series, you will want to rewatch it to understand it better just like Steins;gate. 
both are pretty confusing at the start but makes more sense as u watch it.both have supernatural theme "
2251,10087,2,"Both are thrillers.Both have numerous interesting and conspicous characters with no defenition of which is the main.Both have a fast pacing with something always happening but with quality dialogues as well.Both have supernatural elements and heroes with sad back stories. 
They share two main strengths. There is the relatively big character cast, which gives enough screentime to every important character in a minimal amount of time and there´s the action sequences, which are even better, due to the very good animation in both shows. "
2251,1575,2,"Anime that you can no longer stop watching, the story follows a perfect course every episode and all episodes intertwine * - * is a dificel to understand, understand more when you realize it's perfect anime. 
While this is somewhat non-direct similarity, i had some Code Geass vibes while watching Baccano. So:+ Both have wide cast of developed characters+ Both are very dynamic and active animes+ Both are interesting to watch, as lot of unexpected staff happensOn the minus note:- Both aren't as smart as they may seem at first glance- Both lose their logic more as the show goes onAnyway, if you are not hardcore thinker (i am hardcore thinker only after anime ends, heh), and like interesting and active shows - both are great at those terms "
2251,205,2,"Why these anime, they  are so original, have a lot of action and comedy, if you watch both you will love them. 
Both of these Anime have a rather slap stick comedic approach to their series yet they both can become very dark and very violent at times. There is also a mystery element to both series that many may enoy. "
2251,918,2,"Well, the genres are completly different if I may say so myself but when concerning the characters, both anime are on par. Both Gintama and Baccano! have instant love characters and they both invlude characters that are so crazy, it's simply hilarious.  
Is this a bit of a stretch? Yes. But is it wrong? Not really.-The characters are EXTREMELY similar, from the way some of them act and interact to their voice actors-Both start out as comedy but soon dwell into deeper territory, Baccano! becoming seinen and Gintama becoming shonen.-Both take place in time periods in the past, and while the periods and locations are different, they both have a splash of the supernatural added in to spice up the story (or in Gintama's case, open up the setting to make almost literally anything possible) "
136,21,10,"Just as One Piece,Hunter x hunter is a pretty long shounen anime,both series can be really funny at times ,you will never get bored and always want to see the next episode,both anime have some awesome fights and also the characters are very likable,if you enjoy one of this anime you will most probably like the other one too. 
These two shounen animes are the best of their genre, and im sure anyone who's liked one, will definetly like the other. 
Long running series like One Piece. The main characters have typical characteristics, fun and yet intuitive. You will definitely enjoy this anime 
Both are popular manga that run in the same magazine. They have similar styles and a wide cast of characters. They also have plenty of action and a darker side to the adventure. 
The way that main charcter are not botherin you (like Naruto forex) and the respect that you feal towards Gon, Killua, Hisoka and others in this great anime is somewhat similar to One Piece series 
Both main characters are tremendously similar. Both stubborn, with hidden strong sides, happy-go-lucky attitudes and  they are really single minded. While Luffy goes for the title of Pirate king Gon chases the title of Hunter, with friends that will follow them through the deepest and most dangerous adventures.  
Super engaging/amusing/touching Epic Quest fantasy with a ton of awesome characters. 
One of the easiest recommendations ever. Hunter x Hunter and One Piece deliver top notch emotion and character development, that it's just hard to even avoid them. Any shounen fan should have seen these two animes, because they're bound to love them.  
Both are about adventures and fights and magical things, HxH is  more mature and also way more violent though, it also avoids all the cliche moments seen in most shonen making it more original.I recommend watching the 2011 version for now 
1. Long adventures2. Great action3. Nice plot4. Amazing fight scenes5. Lots of content when you are done with the anime "
136,1535,3,"Brilliant minds. Life and death situations. Story gets darker just as Death Note does. 
They're both mindblowing good. They have some similarities in psychological thinking and plottwists. They have similar characters who are extremely smart or skilled at stuff. I highly recommend both of them. They both have (almost) no boring ep whatsoever. 
in terms of the plot they arent really similar but they both entail the theme of strategy and planning "
136,11061,2,"Hunter x Hunter's first series. It doesn't cover nearly as much as HxH 2011 and is slower paced but is sitll a slightly different adaptation of the first arcs of HxH. 
It remains incredible. The change is that there are things that don't exist in 2011, things that didn't happen. Things take longer in 1999 but it's still cool "
22789,10162,35,"Both have the adult main character growth led by the children surrounding them. Although Usagi Drop feels more dramatic, while Barakamon is more subtle to send a message to the viewers. Both are excellent slice-of-life anime and with great character development. And the feels. 
The second  I saw this coming out I got so excited because it reminded me so much of Usagi Drop, one of my favorite slice-of-lives. Energetic, eccentric, sort of wild little girls coming along and brightening the lives of stuffy guys away from the city, these stories both share this plot. The art work is also similar, as well as the laid-back, vibe. Both little girls are funny and endearing, and both men are subdued at first but of course fall for the amazing kids personalities.  
A guy stumbles upon taking care of a young girl that he didn't expect to take care of. Though the differences are, Usagi Drop is more dramatic than Barakamon, which is more of a silly little light-hearted comedy. 
The main lead characters share an unique bond throughout both series despite their contrasting differences from the beginning. There's an initial development as they learn more about each other and what they enjoy in life. The main male protagonist shares similar personalities and at times can become frustrated at certain events. However, they often take on life as it is with smiles and joy. When it comes down to it, relationship dynamics are a key focus in both series. Recommended for any viewers interested in a charming slice of life. 
• Both shows have an adult male protagonist who grow through building relationships with children (just one with Usagi)• Both are Slice of Life but with serious undertones - although Usagi is more serious• Both have great artwork, characters and plot• Both are extremely heartwarming  
No, I'm not linking these two together because they're both about an adult male taking care of a little girl. Both of these shows make you feel at home and have tons of SOL symbollism that link to morals and themes you would find in real life. Both of these shows tackle family values and realistic character growth. The only difference is that Barakamon is focused on Handa's career (the adult) while Usagi Drop is focused on how Daikichi's life and how he adapts because of Rin. 
Both shows feature an adult being close and caring for a kid (in a non-creepy way) and they're both cute. The differences are that in Barakamon there's the element of the main character's calligraphy career and they're on an island like the countryside but in Usagi Drop there's only the one theme of caring for the kid. 
Both shows have a main character that learns responsibility through their newfound role as surrogate caretaker for a child. 
Barakamon and Usagi Drop are about an adult with a kid hanging around with him. Barakamon is more about a carefree lifestyle while Usagi Drop is bit more seriousness in it since it is within family relationship. While Usagi Drop contain a lot of character development throughout the series, Barakamon is more towards slice of life anime around the village without any romance.Both anime give out heartwarming feeling while watching them, you will definitely think of one another anime if you're already watching one of them. 
Both is about how children's can change a persons life.But not just that.Really funny,loving,cute, also some parts are really touching.Great animes with a sence of summer that you can't avoid  falling in love with them!! 
The main character is an adult who develops alongside a precocious and endearing child with whom he forms a strong, realistic bond. Barakamon is more humorous and Usagi Drop is more heartwarming, but both shows are quite similar and enjoyable to watch. 
When you just want a good, clean story about a man having to live in harmony with a child that's not his. The two anime also compliment each other by masterfully intervolving normal, daily events into bonding exercises between the adults and the children. Just for your own sake, perhaps consider avoiding the Usagi Drop manga if you're interested in it ~ 
Both have everyday life vibe to it, both are heartwarming and very relaxing. If you feel sad or tired, these two shows will make you forget it. 
-Both have adorable kawaii little kids.-Boosts your mood when you are down or neutral.-Both make you feel warm in the inside. xD-You won't stop smiling until the very end.-One of the best slice-of-life anime out there. If you're a slice-of-life kind of individual, then don't miss these gems. 
Both male characters play a substitute role of parent with a child who wants nothing more than to be happy.Both influence each other and are influenced by those around them and show how simply is to get happiness. 
Both Anime have a really relaxed story telling about a more adult character.The plot is completely different but both anime have this magical ""relaxed"" feeling while you are watching the episodes piece by piece. It's the perfect Anime after a stressfull day.(Also the humour from both shows are just hilarious) 
Both are slice-of-life-ish but not necessarily episodic, both involve MCs who are a tad short of middle age and in career ruts, both show MCs making positive strides in their respective social developments, both involve really fun realistic child characters, both are short sweet shows, and both involve pretty artwork and very little ""action"".Barakamon isn't about parenting which is one of Usagi Drop's things, but there are tons of similarities nonetheless.I personally preferred Barakamon to Usagi Drop as the former showed a bit more character development but the difference isn't massive. Good shows both and worth a try even for people who normally don't care for slice of life read more 
Both are slice of life animes that involve adult to child relationships.  Both animes involve protagonists that are suddenly thrown into unfamiliar social environments but but adapt to their situations and build character from their experiences.  They are both refreshingly realistic in the way the characters interact with one another and how they handle change.  Usagi Drop is more realistic than Barakamon in the relationship between its characters, but the latter compensates with the synergy formed by the personality gap between its characters. 
Both Barakamon and Usagi drop are feel-good slice of life shows with a story or theme centered around children and their impact on an adults life (with this being slightly more prominent in Usagi Drop, with neither of the two possessing any ""fantastical"" or out of the ordinary (in regards to real life) aspects.Either show is likely to leave you feeling warm inside by the end of it's run. 
Both are lovely slice-of-life anime with a focus on the relationship between children and adults. Humorous and sweet. 
Both anime have a lighthearted, playfull air with occasionally some deeper elements. The comedy itself is similar  in both anime and serves as a nice extra without being relied upon. The story in both anime focuses on the lives of a still kind of young, single man, looking for his place in the world. A small girl plays an important role in both of their searches. 
both of these stories start with meeting a child these children lead them to different events in their lifestyle which they are similar,but both of them are very interesting on their own i realllyy recommend watching either one  
A sweet young girl, suddenly enters the life of a solitary working man, and changes the way he perceives things in a delightful way. 
both deal with a friendship between an adult man and an unusual young girl near-flawlessly and are refreshingly free of awkward tropes. Usagi Drop is more focused on the struggle of a new parent, while Barakamon focuses more on the friendship involved, but in both cases it is handled very sensitively and leaves you with a warm fuzzy feeling. 
If you like children, you will definitely enjoy both. They both are set where a male adult is living with children surround them. The characters are all lovable and enjoyable to watch. However, Usagi drop has a dramatic setting in which Daikichi needs to adapt his ""new"" way of living with Rin while Barakamon has a ""Slice of life/Comedy"" tone to it.If you have time, you check out both! 
Character development of the MC through the presence of a younger childBarakamon has a subtle change while Usagi Drop is a bit on the serious note. 
In both Anime does the main character have, to a certain degree, a father role to the child he's taking care of.Both anime are slice of lifeAnd both anime are on a more slower pace making them easy relaxing shows for the most part. 
Barakamon and Usagi Drop have 'father figures' as their central characters and show these characters' grow when they take on responsibility and interact with the children who look up to them.  
both had adult protagonist and had children too take care but usagi drop more dramatic and barakamon more comedy. 
Both anime are similar in story and character where both anime tells the story about a male adult take care of girl. The girl isn't similar but the similar things is how the MC get troubled with every thing concerning the girls. It's fun and it's a good anime to watch when you're tired and need some entertainment.  
Is so beatiful, how the relation into the person of anime, kid with u (""father""), make you want one son. 
They're both heartwarming and simplistic which will calm your mind. Both shows have unusual family circumstances and the main character learns how to adjust to their odd circumstances. It maturely handled themes with the importance of family values/morals in a subtle manner. 
Both are similar in a lot of ways especially in terms of the artstyle and the chemistry with Handa Sei and Kotoshi Naru is very similar to the relationship in Usagi Drop with Kawachi Dai and Kaga Rin. While Usagi Drop is more of a drama rather then being a light hearted comedy it does have a couple of funny scenes with the character interactions both have really lovable characters but in my opinion personally out of the two shows I like Usagi Drop a little more because it's main story is more developed and impactful I prefer Barakamon for it's comedy and slapstick humor both are Great Slice of Life anime in my opinion I highly recommend you watch both. read more 
-Excellent slice of life feeling-Protagonist development surrounding by younger people-Heartwarming as hell-Unique relation between kids and protagonist-Relaxed/Chilling pace-Comedy/drama work between each other pretty good 
The main similarity with Usagi Drop and Barakamon is that both of them have lots of heartfelt messages to share. While the latter is a bit more light and relaxed, the former showcases a bit more dramatic atmosphere to inspire some mellow emotions from the viewer. Now as for the character persona, it'd be weird if you didn't notice the very apparent resemblance (as that is the the biggest correspondence of all for both). "
22789,31646,6,"Both is Slice of life ,you can enjoy watching the main character develop  and  the little girls in both are so cute in many ways :3  
Both main characters were isolated because of their profession. MC in 3-gatsu is a professional shogi player, MC in barakamon is a professional calligrapher. Both MC get help and inspiration from new friends.Both stories are slice of life and realistic. 
-The three sisters and people around the MC drag him out of his darkness.-Both settings feel very calming and relaxing most of the time 
If u r looking for a slice of life that makes u realize the importance of living your life by enjoying the company of others and also bringing calmness and peace of mind, then these are a must watch. U'll learn to care not only for urself but  for others also. 
-Both anime start with a depressed protagonist-Character development relies heavily on surrounding people-Excellent slice of life/drama especially 3-gatsu no lion-Good/Relaxed BGM, Super good OP, Heartwarming-Both protagonists are professional at calligraphy(barakamon) and shougi (3-gatsu)-Both characters receive support or inspiration from their friend and family 
Both 3-gatsu no Lion and Barakamon manage to combine slice of life and drama elements in an effective way. If you like your wholesome slice of life drama shows that will make you want to cheer for the characters and which also convey their personal development beautifully, I think you might like both of these anime.  "
22789,4081,4,"The setting of the two shows is rather different, but they both have that really strong ""feelgood aura"" to them. They are both really, really sweet, and full of emotions. They pick you up after a bad day and leave you with good feelings. 
-Both have a soft atmosphere that makes you feel warm and fuzzy on the inside-Both are slice of life, Natsume is just supernatural-Both are about friendship, bonds, and enjoying the life you have right now. 
its fluffy and light. Same feels as natsume yuujinchou and all those warm slice of life moments. Both also have a serious and dramatic side. Try it!  
very light hearted warm anime to watch .. just beautiful. "
22789,23273,3,"Both series are about a by-the-book artist opening up and becoming more creative.In Barakamon, it's by moving to the countryside and meeting people there.In Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, it's by meeting another artist. 
Few individuals in this world are fortunate enough to do what they love for a living, and even fewer are perseverant enough to continue to love what they do for a living. Have you ever picked up an interest that had so inspired you when you were little, only to be overwhelmed by the expectations and obligations involved as you tread deeper into the field?Putting aside the fact that one anime is a drama and the other a comedy, Shigatsu and Barakamon both pull off thematic character developments in strikingly similar manners, delving into the core epiphany of the Arts where one's talent serves not merely in maintaining a living or impressing others but more importantly in the reflection, the expression, and the enrichment of one's own self. Let the stories of the characters within  inspire you, or perhaps remind you once again, to live and improve with passion. read more 
Both stories deal with an artist who used to be the best in their field, but due to some event, they are unable to produce their level of art anymore. They both end up meeting with another person (multiple in Barakamon) who essentially reshapes the MC and teaches them there is more to their respective arts than just doing them the way critics want them toIn more specifics, YLiA deals with the MC unable to recreate his music due to the death of his mother, and Barakamon deals with a painter that is unable to create his own unique style of work. "
22789,20583,2,"The whole atmosphere is similar. Both series are full of jokes and cute stuff. They also have that character development thing... but main similar thing is humour style.  In both series I enjoyed every single moment and wanted to make a gif :) 
Though this anime is about sports, it has a similar atmosphere, its heart warming anime with many loveable characters, hard to find any character that you can hate here "
22789,918,2,"The main characters in both series are similar. Gintoki and Handa are adults who I find really alike. They take care of people younger than themselves, like how Gintoki gave Kagura a place to live and Handa entertaining Naru. These two series give off almost the same aura, feelings, and atmosphere. The story is also set in Japan for the both of them. Comedy is something that isn't lacking in any of the mention anime.  Moreover, the life lessons in these anime is the real deal. I truly believe that Gintama and Barakamon are good anime to watch. 
Both shows manage to blend hilarious comedy flawlessly with surprisingly heartwarming depth. Both develop their characters in a way that makes them lovable, and yet we are capable of laughing at their failures. Barakamon is a little more polished in my opinion, while Gintama I more over the top. While there is a huge difference in setting, the themes and core story structure is the same. Again, Barakamon has it's story a lot more fleshed out, while Gintama has a broader view of all it's ideas. "
22789,1210,2,"There are some similarities about main characters. They are young adults, don't like spending time with people and got many psychological and creavtiveness problems. Characters also changes through the anime. 
Looks at flaws in a person and follows said person in a comedic but grounded way towards self improvement. Authentic and touching. "
22789,523,2,"Despite one series having a supernatural quality and the other not I found myself feeling the same warm feeling regarding both story lines yet the young protagonists are full of life which I found quite enjoyable. I might even describe it as charming. 
Okay, they are not that similar, since My Neighbor Totoro is more like a fantasy/adventure movie, while Barakamon is a slice of life/comedy. But both of them have a very light atmosphere which helps to reduce stress. Also, the two animes take place in the countryside and have, as one of the protagonists, a little girl who is very cute and highly curious, and brings troubles to the other protagonist of the story.  "
22789,1698,2,"Both are slice of life comedies which include a serious artist who take themselves too seriously having their life turned upside down by eccentric characters. The artist then becomes better at what they do as they learn about life and what is really important in life. Both have a focus on friendship. 
Lighthearted, introspective dramedies that follow an artist's journey to improve by learning from those around them.  "
37105,11843,10,"Grand Blue = Daily Lives of College Boys. Both are good for a laugh  
It's highschool comedy to the max, yo! Quite seriously those two take worn-out formula and for once make it unbelievably funny. 
Both series are directed by Takamatsu Shinji, and their comedic styles are similar. Just like the high school boys in ""Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou"", the college boys in ""Grand Blue"" are also silly guys and often make troubles. They have a strong desire to date pretty girls, but in most cases the dates will be destoryed by their buddies.If you like one of the two series, the other will certainly make you laugh. 
Both are great comedy titlesBoth contain school lifeBoth have amazing face designs (if you know what i mean)To me grand blue feels like a sequel to Danshi koukousei no nichijou because its like from daily lives of highschool boys grand blue becomes daily lives of collage boys 
If you loved Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou or even liked, I highly recommend you to watch Grand Blue.These animes have the same kind of humor and they will make WTF and unexpected moments like Gintama.Both mains characters of these animes will make silly faces along the episodes .Even if Grand Blue use multiples times the same kind of jokes (for example the naked guys at the ""Grand Blue Diving Shop"" or the main characters who drank an excessive amount of alcohol every time), it's always hilarious and I'm sure at like 99% that with Grand Blue (or Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou if you already watched Grand Blue lol) you will laugh out loud xD (And that's good for you because laughing is good for health xDDD) read more 
Both anime are fairly realistic without too many regular comedy tropes, personally I prefer Grand Blue over Daily Lives Of Highschool Boys because its more realistic for both highschool and college life. Also both anime have some seriously funny repeating jokes wich I usually dislike but for some reason the more they repeat the funnier they are in these series. Both anime evoke quite strong feelings of nostalgia and happiness in me, as they remind me of messing around and just living life with my friends, and if you also miss being out with your homies then I strongly suggest these anime. 
Comedy in both the series is great. I had a blast watching both of them. While Grand Blue has a proper story, High School Boy's Daily Lives has mini stories with followups. You will laugh alot while watching. So, just watch em and decie for yourself. :D 
This is just a comedy anime and just looks on to fun students have in their college life. 
It's simple, EPIC COMEDY for both shows and it's really enjoyable to watch!  
A but lacking in story and animation. Doesn't have a Main character but focused on everyone. But it's funny "
37105,918,7,"one is about college idiots drinking alcohol, the other one is about idiots in general, the one real thing they have in common is that they are fucking hilarious, both make my face and stomach hurt too much because of their sheer stupidity 
Same sort of humor :*Characters are all as*holes with quite a few screws loose.*Masterful subversion of anime tropes*Energetic and excessive*Misunderstandings and overreactionsThese sorta things.If you are an anime afficionado and love absurd humor, then these 2 shows are for you. Might take some time getting into it though, but definitely worth it ! 
Cast of lovable idiots constantly gets into absurd situations that will make you laugh your ass off. 
Golden comedy. While Grand Blue is more vulgar and alcohol dependent, Gintama is more Shounen kind of comedy. Still, alongside GTO and Saiki, those are the best comedy anime I've ever seen 
Both shows consist of over the top comedy, filled with overly exaggerated scenarios and facial expressions. 
Similar to Gintama,Grand blue is an anime that is so funny that it makes your stomach hurt.Weird and funny....... 
Both are about idiots doing stupid things, and being entertained by it. "
37105,32182,2,"What does a show about diving and a show about supernatural, telekinetic powers have in common? The body improvement club! While they serve different purposes narratively, the muscular dudes in both Grand Blue and Mob Psycho serve as the lovable guidance in the series that help the protagonist grow into a better person through their sheer kindness and willpower. 
They are both hilarious but mob psycho has some really good heartwarming moments. "
35557,13125,18,"Houseki no Kuni is probably what you came to Shinsekai Yori to see, but did not receive. Where the latter fails - characters, story (especially pacing), and art, the former is a preeminent example of the ""new and bizarre world, slowly unraveled by the characters, for better or for worse"" sub-sub-sub-category of shows.Land of the Lustrous is a masterclass in weaving an intricate and believable world out of the highest quality threads of art, music, and storyboarding. The art is a bold step for the up-and-coming Studio Orange, and the soundtrack by Yoshiaki Fujisawa is a beautiful accompaniment to the gorgeous visuals. Not to be missed! read more 
Both are about a cast of characters slowly unraveling unknown truths of their worlds. They both have a similar premise, where the main characters don't fully understand the worlds they live in, and most of the story focuses on this journey of discovery. They both focus not only on the main characters but the society that they live in (society being used very loosely in the case of Houseki no Kuni). 
The mystery in both series works the same way. They both give extreme thrills as the main character goes through obstacles to discover the truth. There are lots of chase scenes that remind me of each other. Not only that, both series have similar style of art and music where it's very traditional/classic and revolves around myths and stories. They are both incredible mystery/sci-fi series. 
While I was watching Houseki no Kuni, I kept thinking back to Shinsekai yori. They're both set in a unique futuristic world with a young protagonist that has to learn some dark truths about society and life. Houseki no Kuni has a little bit more comedy, but they give off a very similar feeling of loneliness. 
Set in a very distant future, after human society as we know it has perished and other living organisms have evolved or undergone significant mutations to suit the new characteristics of their environment. What remains of the current human civilization and its exploits (if anything, really) is often shrouded in mystery or even legends. The viewer’s presented with a vast, unexplored world full of mysteries which slowly unravel before our curious and (at least at the start) fairly inexperienced protagonists, as they grow stronger in both their physique and understanding of the world and as they struggle to accept many of its often unforgiving aspects.Full of touching and sometimes even heartbreaking moments, both tales amaze the viewer with their elaborate storytelling as well as their stunning landscapes and memorable music. The somewhat desolate, yet beautiful setting full of lush greenery compliments these beautiful stories with all their intricate worldbuilding and eerie secrets hidden behind their fairly innocent beginnings. The incorporation of buddhist aesthetic is also something the two have in common.  read more 
Both follow a character who lives in a unique world full of mysteries they have yet to solve. The two shows give off some similar vibes and share a few similar ideas.  
Both Series have a similar setting: They play in a time long after the present day, in the distant future, where most technological progress has been lost. Another similarity is that they both have female leads trying to discover the secrets of their world and society.There's also a lot of character development and suprises in Shinsekai Yori and Houseki no Kuni. 
They both don't know anything about their world 
Very similar settings and utopias about completely new societies in the future. They have a similar atmosphere as well and both contain more depth and mysteries behind their utopian facade.  
Both series take place in a dystopian world in which the world has not necessarily advanced technologically. They have a similar setup in the fact that you learn about these societies and the dark secrets that they hide. 
Both shows follow similar concepts, with strange beings who are initially considered to be evil/the enemy shrouding the truth behind their existence, which the MC begins to discover as the story progresses  
Both take place in the distant future, in a society that has changed dramatically with time, and slowly build on that foundation to tell the story of how the world came to be via fantastic world-building, and coming to terms with living in that world. 
Shinsekai Yori and Houseki no Kuni both thrust the viewer into a mysterious and unknown world, slowly unveiling it's secrets through the experiences of the characters. There is a strong presence of philosophical exploration in both shows, each of which blends this seamlessly into their story and characters. This provides a rich and fulfilling experience where the deeper meanings and messages feel like part of the shows rather than the events being merely vessels to impart morals and ideologies.  
Both series feature an enthralling and mysterious world where a catastrophic event occurred sometime in the past. Both have settings that are not all as they seem at first glance. Both feature strong protagonists that grow over the course of the story as they work to uncover the mysteries of their world. Both have characters with seemingly superhuman abilities. If you enjoyed one, you will most likely enjoy the other due to the numerous similarities. 
Both shows make you ask questions about humanity and existence in general. Both shows are absolute masterpieces. 
The plot and scenery are reminiscent of each other, in a distant future where humans have drastically changed. They're both good, character driven stories that have a very similar vibe, and I enjoyed them both in a similar way. 
-Female protagonist ( yes I prefer phos as a female )-Both got a mysterious world atmosphere-Both protagonist maturity depends on what they had experienced-A hidden plot/story which unfolds in each episode-Both anime got two different species which protagonist trying to understand 
Both protagonists live in a distant future of human society and learn more about the truth of their worlds as the story progresses, not only that but from beginning to end both protagonists drastically change from who they were at the beginning of the story. In short, the mystery presented in both of these shows is very similar, and there's significant character development in each. "
35557,34599,6,"the atmosphere, world building and how it starts with a mysterious world that you learn more and more about as the story unfolds. Houseki, has better character development and tackles some interesting themes such as what it means to be alive and what gives us meaning, what we have to sacrifice to gain something special and so on its real beep if you are willing to look deeper. 
Both animes give me the same sense of wonder and mistery from its world building, joining moments of beauty with tragedy. 
Fantasy settings with the main characters starting out naive and inexperienced, yet grow stronger alongside their friends. Although Made in Abyss does not have a central villain and Houseki no Kuni does, they both share a mystical atmosphere that leaves the viewer intrigued. Furthermore, there is a similar ranking system (Whistles in MiA and Hardness levels in HnK). They both have fantastic soundtracks that pull you into the show.If you're looking for a similar manga, 7 seeds is a fantasy horror manga where a group of children wake up in a post-apocalyptic world, decimated by nature, where they must learn to survive. Both 7 seeds and MiA center around dark themes, although 7 seeds is more mature.  read more 
They both have a similar feel in that they are about a mysterious world which are very harsh to its inhabitants. 
They both start with an adventurous and spirited girl in a mysterious world, of which she later discovers darker parts. Although they both have dark themes and can make you cry at some points, they also both have a lot of lighthearted cuteness and humour. I would say that in Made in Abyss it is mainly the surroundings changing and secrets being uncovered that are the driving force behind the story, while in Houseki no Kuni it is mainly the character development that drives the story. Another big difference is that the style of the visuals is very different, but I personally think they both look beautiful in their own ways. read more 
Both shows have a standout visual presentation and a dense world with a sense of mystery that is rare to find. Made in abyss is more straightforward with its story with more intense drama whereas Houseki no Kuni  is more roundabout and intricate focusing more on cultivating mystery. Both shows are aimed more towards adults. As an oversimplification, HnK focuses more on world building while MiA tells a more conventional character driven story but both series have a similar mystery-drama foundation "
35557,30,3,"Aside from the similarity in their narratives, where we see lots of religious symbolism strewn throughout a post-apocalyptic world, Evangelion and Lustrous share a love of evocative and atmospheric visual direction, especially in regards to the backgrounds, and they both regularly highlight emotional character notes throughout the series through this type of direction. Phos also shares a lot of similarities with Shinji, including issues with self-worth, depression, loneliness, and resentment. In regards to other characters, both shows feature a large cast of well-developed and generally broken characters who all get explored on some level. Fans of existential entertainment, character studies, and great visual direction should check out both shows.  read more 
Cryptic pseudo-symbolism, a worthless main character, and a thick air of mystery that tells you something's not quite right 
Both possess similar concept, setting on apocalyptic era, where Evangelion has tormented haunting angels, Houseki no kuni has moon dwellers in this stead. Both explore physiological issues in the later episodes. By 'Change' underlies the themes, from transformation, resistance, and acceptance. Both deconstructed its issues through philosophical lens.   "
35557,16498,3,"They're both set in a distant future with naive main characters that simply want to know more about the world they live in. The overarching themes that come later in the series are similar too, at least in my opinion. 
Both shows present very interesting settings, and part of the fun is just learning about the world and its mysteries. 
I would rather not spoil all of Attack on Titan but these shows can be strikingly similar when looked at closely.  The enemies in Attack on Titan (the the titans) hold an unusual likeness to Houseki no Kuni's Lunarians.  While at the same time both shows display similar themes of wanting to change, grow stronger, etc.  Both protagonists seek out the truth of the unusual circumstances they live in. "
36538,28957,1,"A kind protagonist helping humans and creatures that lie beyond our sight. Both have calm and beautiful environment, tracks are soothing and it's a perfect show to watch after a long, tiring day. "
38826,32281,41,"It's made by the same director, who pays attention to great details in movies. Plus, that other movie's characters make cameos here.Both movies have supernatural themes, and romantic relationships developing between their poster couples. 
Love stories with a touch of supernatural. Both done by the same director and are awesome movies everyone should watch. They share the same universe(Tenki no Ko has cameos from Kimi no Na Wa's characters) which is irrelevant for the plot but fun fact to know.  
Overall, Makoto Shinkai's films tend to complete themselves, since all the films are set in the same universe. Also, in the search of a visual experience at same level (spoiler: its very hard to find) or if you just want to watch a more deeper story, Kimi no Na Wa probably its the right choice to you 
Same director, same art design and the story structure itself is quite similar 
-Amazing soundtrack-Amazing Artwork-Good plot-Super good climax scene-RADWIMPS/Makoto Shinkai-Both anime focus on the relationship between the two character-Both anime create a supernatural situation 
Both:from the same universesame director and amazing animationRadwimps musicsRomance, drama and adventureVery epic climax 
-Two absolutely stunning movies by the man himself - Makoto Shinkai-A love-story infused with the supernatural and more-High production soundscape and OSTs-Definite must-watch titles if you've watched just one :) 
Very similar and EXTREMELY SAME formula by Shinkai as well. Country kid goes to Tokyo, meets girl/boy, relationship develops, drama happens or lose contact (basically any shinkai film type thing)..... The only thing that this movie has better than Your Name is that: it has action throughout the whole film, better animation (2019), more romance and development, and comedy. Your Name is better at everything else and even the art (not animation) is more vibrant and pretty. An amazing film but almost as good as Your Name. A must watch 
This is an obvious comparison as both share the same visual style and director, but Your Name and Weathering With You are well-animated anime films with themes of romance and the supernatural (the latter is even set in the same universe as the former, though it's not necessary to watch the former to enjoy the latter). Several other similarities are well-done musical montages (as well as RADWIMPS), family problems, an emotionally charged climax, and a touch of Japanese culture. 
Other than the fact that these two were crafted by Makoto Shinkai and his team thus having the same art style and animation, they also contain the same formula and elements. Both revolve contain Shinto religion, both are love stories with supernatural aspects revolving around them, both contain extremely similar story/plot and pacing structure (especially during the climax), and both have RADWIMPS for the music. 
Tenki no Ko takes a more cynical approach to the supernatural, showing what happens when the will of the gods/supernatural interferes in the lives of the modern age.Instead of going on a desperate love quest to look for his destined one, he finds her at the beginning, easy right? Wrong. Life is simply unfair, and much more punishing than that.Overall, I feel like the flow of the story was much more fluid than Kimi no Na Wa. However, I would say the emotional parts aren't as powerful. Granted, this movie works wonders as a sequel, occurring 1 year after Taki and Mitsuha get together.The movie includes more realistic themes than Kimi no Na Wa but requires less knowledge of Japanese culture, because of how the details are strongly implied to you. The movie is even more realistic than the Kimi no Na Wa because of the fact that it's more connected to the city, but the protagonist is just so unintelligent it's sometimes painful to endure.Overall, I would recommend just sitting back and letting the movie take you in. The flow is just so well done. The sound design is brilliant, and the music is just so good of a match. The ending is an acquired taste, but I think a certain appearance will make you grin in your seat. read more 
It's made by the same director, who pays attention to great details in movies. Plus both movies have stunning visuals 
made by shinkai makotoanimated by same studiosimilar animationheartwarming story 
A transcendental love story. Your Name and Weathering With You are both great boy meets girl stories around two teenagers who are caught up in supernatural affairs.Your Name follows Taki and Mitsuha as they continuously body swap with one another leading to a journey to find one another. Weathering With You follows runaway Hodaka and 'sunshine girl' Hina on their journey of helping others via weather changing powers and finding a place to be.Both simple supernatural romance but are visual eye candy with amazing OST, made by the same director Makoto Shinkai. 
Kimi no Na wa and Tenki no Ko are both created by Makoto Shinkai and Radwimps did both of the stunning sound tracks.~ Both are romance, drama, and fantasy/supernatural~ Both have really unique storylines~ Really pretty visuals and amazing music~ Both are really bitter-sweet and are full of feels~ They also both have appearances from characters in other Shinkai worksOverall they are both really amazing films that I think almost anybody could love. 
Made by the same person, very similar character personalities. Art style is amazing in both. 
They are both from the same director. Both of them start using the logic of the real world (meaning that everyone know that time traveling or super powers are not real for example) and then they start being illogical like allowing time traveling for example.In both of these anime the same band sings.Both will make you cry.How the story flows and everything else are really similar in both of these animes. 
Both of the movies are directed by same person.And they both have stunning visual's with a very good story. 
Also directed by Shinkai, has both supernatural and romance elements with gorgeous visuals and storytelling.  
They are both linked and the visuals are absolutely stunning with great stories! Both directed & written by Makoto Shinkai  Production Company: CoMix Wave Films 
both films are very good and a perfect anime for anybody looking for a romance film.  
Both of the movies are directed by Makoto Shinkai, and they exist in the same universe. Bunch of references to the previous movie, similarly beautiful scenery and animation. Both movies are awe-inspiring in similar ways, you will be immersed so greatly that the fictional world will become real and you will wish to share the experiences with the characters yourself. Both movies TRULY AMAZING. 
The awaited sequel to Makoto Shinkai's highly praised and extremely well-received Kimi No Na Wa, or Your Name, Weathering With You has become another prominent movie in the early 2020 movie roster. I personally enjoyed Weathering With You more-so than Your Name, but that might just be my craziness. While both films' plots are debated frequently, the soundtrack of Weathering With You is objectively better, as RADWIMPS have simply outdone themselves in this new story. It might not matter much to you, but the soundtrack of a movie is very determinant in my overall enjoyment of it, and in some cases, can carry a movie the whole way through. read more 
Both are about a mysterious event happening, also a developing relationship between a girl and a boy 
Its another Makoto-goddamn-Shinkai movie, need more convincing?He manages to somehow perfect Your Name's visual fidelity, by some voodoo black magic make it even more detailed than before, with even the skidding of a shoe launching into a sprint off a floor slick from heavy rain looking perfect.RADWIMPS makes a return, orchastrating only another perfect fitting OST for Weathering With You.The only concern you should have is to not ride the tsunami of hype that Your Name brought over into your watching of Tenki No Ko. Its not a sequel, it wasn't written to be one, and should be respected as its own film.You'll want this over any blue sky. read more 
Both masterpieces by the same director Makoto shinkai. 
Both are great romance movies with a side of supernatural on them, they're great starters for people who just got into romance anime/movies, if you have watched the one, you should watch the other certantly. 
Both are made by the same studio and they are about a romantic relationships developing between a couple. They're also wonderfully animated, great soundtrack and there's a touch of supernatural. 
The same author.Same artstyle. You might enjoy Kimi No Na Wa more but it's both amazing 
With the same studio and director, both movies give great detail to the scene and surroundings, making it really enjoyable to watch. The two stories are based on a supernatural idea witch carries the story of two students and the adversities they have to go through.If you've watched either and enjoyed it, the other is a sure must. 
Same atmosphere, same director. Happen to be on the same page, but different timeline. Both about romance, both have some supernatural stuff. 
They both are visually pleasing and surround 2 characters that are brought away from each other and have a journey to get back together. 
This is probably the closest you are going to get if want something similar to Your Name. Its got the same artstyle, director, band doing the OST, and type of plot (romance/supernatural). A definite recommendation! 
Both explore relationships in a fantasy manner and the main protagonists fall for people who seem close but are also quite far away. The animation for both are also really pretty 
They are both made by Mokoto Shinkai and are similarly in plot beats such as that they are both about a romance with some supernatural element.  
Both sad, both very aesthetically pleasing :) 
SImilar romance movies that deal with natural events. Two people who feel out of place find their place due to each other. Also, the animation quality is similar  
The art styles of both movies are breathtaking, and they are directed by the same legend Makoto Shinkai. 
Very similar art styles and genres, both beautiful movies. 
Another movie filled with emotions created by Shinkai sensei. If Your Name made you cry you will tear up watching this movie too. 
Yes, this is quite obvious since both were written by our beloved Makoto Shinkai. In my opinion, ""Your Name"" outclasses ""Weathering with You"" since the latter has several plot holes, somewhat of a disturbing message (sacrifice), and an immature and irresponsible main character. HOWEVER, regardless it is still an amazing watch as the animation is breathtaking! Anyways, if you haven't watched either I strongly recommend. (Also, as a side note, watch ""I want to eat your pancreas"" if you haven't already:) ) "
38826,28805,2,"Addresses similar themes concerning found families, runaways, and fantasy elements, but does it with a stronger attention to detail in terms of the story on presentation.  
Runaways. Weathering With You and The Boy and The Beast both feature children runaways who end up entwining their lives with some supernatural entity.Tenki no Ko is Hodaka and his fate with ""sunshine girl"" Hina. Boy and Beast is about Ren and his time as Kumatetsu disciple. Both Hodaka and Ren find new people along this way to aid them in their objectives too.Both are good fantasy anime movies with great visuals, though Tenki no Ko features romance compared to a father-son relationship in Boy and Beast. "
38826,28851,1,"Changing with hardships. Weathering With You and A Silent Voice follows MCs who wishes to change their lives for the better due to past experiences.Weathering With You follows Hodaka as a runaway going into Tokyo, struggling at first. A Silent Voice is the same though Shouya changes as he ages due to his past as a bully, struggling in the process.Both are great visual masterpieces with Weathering With You having supernatural, fantasy elements. Whilst A Silent Voice is a school drama about the change of a bully. "
777,33,7,"Both have lots of bloods and guts, as well as some excellent action. Berserk could be summed up as a Medieval Hellsing 
both is very violent and has blood and gore berserk was produced in the 90s so its art work isnt that nice but the story is comparable to those  shonen like naruto.hellsing is a very recent version of the original and its a lot better than original ,so all the hellsing fans should also take a look at berserk,its worth your time 
Both have one of the most badass MC's in anime history, strong female lead(s), great action scenes, lots of blood and gore, rape-filled backstories, superpowered monsters, influences from Christianity, rivalry/betrayal between friends, strategic warfare, well-developed characters, great plot and last but not least: they're both amazing anime. 
One word: BLOODY! Both Hellsing and Berserk are similar in a way. Both of the two protagonists have a similar dark past and grown to become strong as F**K. I mean Alucard is like a devil himself, and Guts was given the name ""hundred man slayer."" Anyway, if you love one of these series, I can guarantee you'll love the other. 
Both have a seemingly unkillable main character indulging in gratuitous violence, and philosophical undertones (which I think Berserk does better).  
Anime that indulge the viewer in extreme amounts of blood and gore with a badass MC that doesn't hold back. A must-watch series. 
Both are set in dark fantasy settings with supernatural horror. Rather cynical in nature, human life is worth little, people often die and the protagonists often blur the line between a cruel anti-hero and an outright villain protagonist. Also, excluding some creatures (e.g elves in Berserk), monsters are mostly either humans or of former human origin. "
777,10087,4,"First of all, Alucards voice actors in this series which I didn't know at first and boy there is irony and reminiscene when the character with Alucard's voice appeared.If youve watched Hellsing I reccomend this sooo much butjust for fun the reason why i made this reccomendation was because,which you shuld just skip to for a sneak, of a scene six minutes into EP 8 there was a forest fight scene with the char with Alucards voice that made me just think back at hellsing and fights(nd see such irony).... like using a holy bayonet to block a barrage of bullets...so priestly *hint hint*Episode 11 Watched that and It was another Hellsing moment when someone's noble phantasm was released. read more 
The servant to master relationship is a very big part of both shows and each express dark themes and qualities. Alucard's nature and arrogance reminded me a lot of Gilgamesh for some reason as well. Furthermore, the catholic church is a massive part of both series. The characters were all very smart, and some of the tactical plots in both shows were genius and amazingly well executed. Additionally, each show is mostly based off of a war that was detrimental to society and the endings were very similar. I don't want to spoil anything, so I won't say any more, but I will say that both shows are some that I will highly recommend, and if you like one, your sure to like the other. read more 
> the characters are mythical heroes from antiquity which you can only find in legends or true hisorical personalities ( but they still add to it ) and each has an own desire for fighting> the main subject that links the characters is a 'War'- Note : Hellsing Ultimate is much more gory than Fate/Zero and has waaay more action scenes. 
Both anime are a feast to the eyes. Both have a story line that goes way back and I don't have much to say about it just watch it if you haven't already. "
777,2251,4,"Both are intensely bloody, using physical decapitations/trauma and psychological teasers that bring interest and diligence. Their story lines are similar in the aspects of immortality, violence, power, and interest. 
Baccano and Hellsing (ultimate) are both amazing seinen anime which revolve around supernatural beings and immortality. They contain a lot of action, blood, guns and amazing characters who will make you want them to succeed in what they're doing. Great anime to watch, both of them.  
Noise. Western setting in place of a more conventional eastern one. Glorification of violence. Overabundance of blood. Uncommon friendships and betrayals.  Unusually long life cycles. Overpowered eccentric males. Silent females who kick butt. Supernatural versus ordinary. Youth versus experience. Kick-ass English dubs which are arguably better than their original counterparts.  
While these shows have completely different premises, they both are filled with trigger-happy lunatics and some of the most memorable characters you will ever see in anime. Morals in both of these shows are very grey and there is blood galore! So if you're looking for a insane, bloody, action fest with supernatural elements, look no further than either of these shows. "
777,1535,2,"If you love dark anime with gorry scens then these two are for you. The stoies have a dark premies about them that youll love 
Stories feature dark heroes whose goal is to save the day involving a blonde haired female orphans in a crusade against an antagonist/rival who are the head of the orphanage filled with potential successors and soldiers with opposing beliefs with an epic animation, art, ost, and storytelling as both are related to Madhouse. "
777,1575,1,"If you like a good story with great action, dialogue, and a well drawn plot, CG and HU may be the shows for you to watch. After watching both, I began to see similarities as both are set in a modern setting with fictional elements mostly that has to do with myths and supernatural powers. Other than just mindless fighting and massive chaos, methodical fights and tactics come into play as well. The story starts off similar and ends in a twisted manner which goes the same for CG R2.  "
40682,37521,1,"In both anime there are: * Brutal worlds where characters have to kill to stay alive.* Revenge for the lost ones. * Beautiful visuals. So if you like the elements mentioned you should definitely check them out.  "
22535,1535,12,"Both shows:*Produced by Madhouse.*Main characters are accompanied by a being that is outside of their ''normal'' world.*Main characters hide their secret from everyone else.*People having ''mysterious deaths'',  although the causes are different in each show. Although there are many differences, they are both great if you enjoy series with good quality and dark undertone. 
Both animes have a premise, death note being the death note, and parasyte being the parasyte. Both shows have characters that build and develop around this premise. which in turn also creates a thicken plot and interesting set pieces of story.   
In both shows the main character stumbles upon a supernatural power and has to hide it from everyone. He uses that power for what he thinks it's good for humanity. He also is accompanied by a cynical supernatural being that comes with that power and he is mostly the only one who can speak to it. These are dark, psychological shows and have a very similar atmosphere. 
I really found my self that i was rewatching Death Note with different Plot. Like1) Cops are suspected of Light for being **** (censored) , same case for protagonist of Parasyte.2) Human are being killed in both anime and cops are trying to solve it.3) Shinigami Ryuk can be seen in terms of Migi (Parasyte, right hand of Shinichi) that no one know but him for both cases. 
Both shows have similar dark tones. They have some supernatural element connected to main characters who have to keep it secret.  
The same studios. Both characters have something to hide from other people and both feel psychological stress. Same atmosphere and dark tones. 
Similar style and narrative structures.  
Both have very interesting plots that are thought-provoking. Both anime are REALLY good and are a big name for a reason. Both are great from beginning to end. Both have some hilarious moments in them! 
They both tell the story of a male high school student acquiring the titular power, which belongs to a supernatural being who proceeds to guide/support the protagonist as he uses this immense power with good intentions, with said power gradually and radically changing him. He keeps his power a secret from most people and is hunted after because of his association to it. He consequently gets increasingly involved with the police.With this same premise, they convey such different stories, as each anime has a power, a set of characters, and a progression, that is unique to their respective anime.Additionally, both anime come from studio Madhouse. 
Both stories follow someone who suddenly comes into possession of an extraordinary power.  Both protagonists fight to conceal their powers from others, while using the powers for various reasons.  Both anime's also aim to make you question your values and morals as a human, which I found interesting.  Both anime's also have an element of investigation of sorts.  Death Note has a lot more involvement with the police, but Parasyte has a decent amount as well.  My first recommendation, but I couldn't help feeling like the two were similar as I was watching Parasyte.  
Both series have a rather low amount of ""randomness"" where foreign elements are added to the story that completely change the course of the story and could feel very unnatural and unnecessary to some people, people who like their stories to have a fair conflict with believable progression from point to point will probably enjoy both series.  
Graced by alien. Death Note and Parasyte both follow a high schooler who ends up in getting paired with an unearthly existence. In this period, the students must stay undercover from the looming threats these unearthly beings have given.DN has Light take one of Ryuk's death notes, thus, becoming a serial killer. Parasyte has Shinichi having a parasite, Migi, live within him.Both are good anime featuring the same character progressions. Though DN is a supernatural, Parasyte is sci-fi. Both brought to you by the same studio Madhouse. "
22535,16498,9,"- Some sort of species threatens the human race- Characters are well developed- Main character is some how involved with the species he hates - Main character gets all bad ass after a dramatic death - Main character seeks revenge 
Humanity is in trouble.Everything hits the fan several times.Male protagonist has ability to save the day in some regards.Lots of ""Learning about the enemy"".Terror and gore common. 
-Both are pretty gory.-Both have very real, intense scenes that emphasize the fear of the characters.-Both have 'monsters' that you want to know more about.-Both show humanity fighting these 'monsters' for survival.-Both MC's have similar motives for fighting.I think if you enjoyed one, you would enjoy the other. 
Both anime feature a good amount of violence and disturbing imagery as well as  a lot of themes about humanity and the characters fighting for it. They intrigue you by making you want to find out more about the monsters they star and then just when you think that you've figured it out they flip it on its head and change how the monsters can and/or do act. The level of threat that both anime manage to build is very real and the when the intense scenes come, BOY are they intense. Neither show holds back on what they will and won't throw at you. On top of similar themes, the main character and his motives for fighting these creatures are also somewhat the same as are certain mysteries in the show - so go ahead and check it out! read more 
Both anime involve powerful alien-like creatures that have a directive to kill humans. MC can use these powers to fight back. The moral dilemma ""am i turning into a monster"" is very present in too. Gory brutal action with a fine dramatic story in a different setting. 
Both focus on the conflict between humans and some kind of 'other' being with an underlining exploration of what it means to be human. Gritty art in both with some gore.  
Both have leads that have the same powers/abilities as the enemyBoth leads become more powerful after being in the verge of deathBoth are horrifying and creepyBoth have leads fighting to save humanity from a mysterious enemyBoth have enemies that eat humans for no reasonKiseijuu like shingeki no kyojin are beautiful done anime with heartwarming scenes and memorable characters that you will remember and grow to love these are truly one of the best anime I have ever seen 
In both anime, a dangerous creature threatens humanity and the main character somehow gets hold or becomes a part of the group that threatens humanity however with his naive rightousness and sense of justice, he finds a way to use the creature to fight it’s own kind. 
I feel like attack on titan is a shounen take on Parasyte, or vice-versa, so if you'd like to see a more seinen approach to a monster/ action/ thriller series, then Parasyte is a must watch.They both tackle the core concept of, ""what makes someone a monster"" and if you enjoy that psychological aspect of attack on titan, and how that moves Erens character and shapes his development, I can garantee that you will like Parasyte, as this concept is the key theme used to show how most of the characters develop in parasyte. "
22535,13125,5,"Two competing factions battle for survival.  In both of these series it is humans vs some kind of perceived monstrous being.  However, soon you realize both are simply vying for survival, an instinct every creature has.  This further blurs the line between good or bad.  Although I think Shinsekai yori does an immensely better job at this than Kiseijuu does, there are parallels and in the end you wonder who is the real monster. 
The most similar thing about these two shows is the question you ask yourself after watching them, they both makes you doubt humanity.The difference is that kiseijuu is more of an action show while shinsekai is more dark mystery theme and unpredictable turns. 
A fictional form of specie with sense of reason revolts against humans, who are more superior than them, as they believe humans are ruling the world with tyranny. 
Shinsekai Yori is set in the very far future about 1000 years from now and people have psychic powers. The children think they live in a utopia until the darker nature of their society is revealed to them. I don't want to spoil you, just trust me on this one. 
These shows are both dark and emotionally heavy and intense. They both pose interesting and intense questions about what it means to be human, and do so through another species. There are significant differences though with SSY having more fantasy elements than Parasyte which is entirely scifi. SSY is also more of a slow burn (especially at the start) than the high energy parasyte.They are also my two favorite anime (SSY is my favorite and Parasyte second). "
22535,19,4,"If you like mature and dark animes like Parasyte, I would suggest Monster. Like Parasyte, it is a great horror and seinen anime. It is a little different than parasyte as it is not about supernatural beings but about a serial killer. Monster is also by Madhouse Studios (the same studio that is making Parasyte). 
Murder! Violence! and Mystery. Both anime contains main character trying to cope with the changing society and trying to resolve the matter on its own hand. Both features, similar setting and deals with the nature of murder and mystery. 
If you like mature and dark animes like Parasyte, Monster would be just for you. It is a great horror and seinen anime, a little different than parasyte as it is not about supernatural beings but about a serial killer.  Murder! Violence! and Mystery. Both anime contains main character trying to cope with the changing society and trying to resolve the matter on its own hand.Although there are many differences, they are both great if you enjoy series with good quality and dark undertone. 
Both anime explore the same question - What separates human from monster?Monster does this via a character drama exploring the monster within all of us, as its protagonist chases what he see as the biggest monster of all.While Kiseijuu does this via showing the contrasting differences and hypocritical opinions between humans and the alien parasite, as its central pair continue to grow closer together from a mental state of position. "
22535,40748,3,"The comparison is clear to anyone who has seen both. Someone even mistook me for watching a new Parasite anime when they briefly glanced over my watching JJK.They both have a foreign entity who inhabits their body and manifests themselves on that body in similar ways. 
Both involve something trying to take over a host's body; and the main character in both are unable to be taken over completely.  
Both are supernaturalBoth are really great Both have the same character designer "

Both have very personal stories full with drama, mystery and deep philosophy. "
22535,11061,2,"The Chimera Ant arc from HxH is somewhat similar to the plot of Kiseijuu. There are heavy moral dilemmas involved and you will slowly lose the sight of who are the good guys and who are bad. 
Both have a same atsmosphere when it comes to fight, wherein the one with smarter tactics will win the fight, not the stronger one..Chimera ant arc from HxH is the most similar to Kisejuu World... "
13601,1535,55,"The series have the same showcase of ""Law versus Crime"", the only difference is the themes. In terms of characters Death Note revolves around two Genius students with different personality and the anti-hero holding a handy-dandy Reaper Notebook while Psycho-Pass revolves between Cops using Advance Techno weapon that has full duplex psychological inspection that switches the gear from a Neurological paralyze r to Anti-matter shooting bullet and Masterminds that have odd different assassination fetish. 
Both anime are dark, deal with crime, and have detectives attempting to catch the criminals committing them. 
* Both have action and criminal scenes.* Both have genius enemies.* Both have characters how fight to change the state of the world.* Both are unpredictable as the next chapters.* Both have a character how rejects the state of the society. 
clearly hereLight = Shinya KougamiL = Shougo Makishimanothing is black or white...everything is greypsycho pass is in a futuristic world where the nation is maintained by a system which is trying to create a utopia but it has a dark side to itthe system has a dark side to itand what is right and wrong is questioned... 
Similar gritty tone with several shared themes. Psycho-Pass places a heavier emphasis on action but, much like Death Note, does not rely on action to progress the story. 
Another anime that features the opposition of two geniuses. But these time both, unlike Light and L, the main hero and the main villain BOTH have criminal psychology which essentially makes them similar rather than different. 
The feel of these two shows is eerily familiar, and especially till the end. They are both thinking animes with lots of complex themes and dramatic moments that take place within a nail-biting struggle between two highly compelling and highly intelligent sides as they wage a war where ideologies may be similar, but ends aren't. Both have a genius criminal with arguably just ends but who use horrible(and brutally efficient) methods to achieve it. Both antagonists are maniacs who want to rid the society of an evil that the viewer identifies and is familiar with, so their cause can often be identified with, and so choosing the villain or protagonist is not so easy.  Both also have a side of detectives fighting to preserve order and condemning the criminal's methods for his better world, even if they agree to hate the evil he is indirectly fighitng to destroy. Both have a bit of corruption and internal turmoil among the side of the detectives. Both anime play very lightly with the lives of characters, and the deaths are almost always the result of a long and elaborate game of wits, which involves a lot of nail-biting possibilities, and apprehension. They deaths are very visceral in both and leave an impression on both you and the characters.  read more 
What makes these two anime's linked is their story, and how society works in regards to crime. Death Note takes place in modern times, while Psycho-Pass is in the future, but both have the same core themes. In the end, it's about corruption and judgement. Who is fit to judge society, and how do we determine such judgement? If you enjoy such themes, and strong story lines, then you'll enjoy this anime. 
There is a villain who constantly gives detectives the runaround. Both villains are stuck with the belief that their murderous actions were acts of justice. Unlike in Death Note, detectives are fully aware of the villain's identity in Psycho-Pass. 
Both anime pose the same theme: re: how do you judge the good and the evil? The villain in Psycho-Pass is just as smart and twisted as Light in Death Note.  
Psycho pass may not be as good as death note but I do recommend any death note fans to check this anime out. Both anime have the similar feel to them. Both have the main characters who have differing views as to what is 'right' or 'wrong' in terms of justice. Similar art, similar atmosphere, both are crime, both have action,l and both do have a thriller aspect to some extent. Mainly, both are very psychological, death note is more 'genius'-like analyzing people's feelings & thoughts type of anime whereas psycho pass doesn't have main characters with as much smartness but the actions & thoughts of the characters really make you think.  read more 
Psycho-Pass is pretty much a mixture of Death Note and Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex.  It is a futuristic game of cat and mouse between two highly intelligent individuals. One being law enforcement equivalent and the other a villain who believes his efforts help society.      
-Psychological theme-A lot of death, though in comparison to Psycho Pass, Death Note's isn't very direct-Centered around crime and investigators-The main character in Death Note is similar to the antagonist in Psycho Pass-Based around morality  -Is killing okay in certain situations? Etc-Both make you think and is more for people with mature mind sets (people who know that things aren't just black and white)I think that if you liked one, you would like the other. 
Both of them are great cat and mouse games where the protagonists want to change the way the society is governed. Both make you think about ethical responsibilities and rally around an ""all or nothing"" approach. 
Both shows focus on the police point of view to stop crime. Features clever characters, outsmarting the enemy, and an overall dark atmosphere.  
Both involve crimes with genius culprits and a very in-depth interesting journey of the investigators catching the culprit. 
Both involves detectives, criminals and a pure genius character who has an abnormal perspective of the world. 
The protagonist and antagonist of these series share similar traits by being driven by one another philosophies.  Light & Koguami  are both geniuses that work for the law. They both wish to rid their world of corruption, by delivering their own form of justice. But,along the way they both become corrupted. Eventually, they both become obsessed with defeating their biggest opponents. (Light v.s L) & (Koguami v.s Makishima). If you like stories about witty heroes who struggle to do what is right without caving into doing what is wrong. You'll enjoy both these series. 
Two enemies who are similarly intelligent and hate each other essentially. The part that makes me feel it's the most similar is when she said that they knew each other better than they knew themselves. 
A lot of people die in gruesome ways and in both shows there are psychological themes.The main character in Death Note is very similar to the antagonist in Psycho Pass.Both are centred around crime and the idea of morality and what is right. 
They both have intelligent, likable main characters and villains and amazing story. Though I like Death Note more, Psycho pass is also really good.  
The main character of Death note and the main antagonist of Psycho Pass are determined to fullfil their goals, and both of their goals have something to do with the whole world.The protagonist of Death Note is being chased by the police, so does the main antagonist.These anime have a similar atmosphere, unique moments and very good characters.Very similar anime, with Death Note being supernatural, and Psycho Pass action. Almost everything else is similar. Both of them pretty enjoyable. 
-Both are really dark games of cat-and-mouse. -Psycho Pass is a bit more dark in terms of gore, but you'll love Death Note even so.-There is no solid ""good"" or ""bad"" guy in these animes. You'll just have to side with who's more ""right"". -The MCs are either ""Anti-Heroes"" or ""Anti-Villains"". All of the MCs may be right in their goal, but their methods are dirty. -""The End Justifies the Means."" is the most accurate quote to describe the Main Characters. Both are great animes to watch if you're a fan of psychological animes that dig deep on the human behaviour. 
Both make you question what is morally right from wrong and both will have you speculate what life is truly about after your finished. 
To control this world is Good man or Evil man.Both are handle crime eradication and society of morality.Protagonist of DN, Light Yagami, He uses DEATH NOTE, and kill evils for his justice.Protagonist of PP, Shinya Kougami, He belongs to Public Safety Bureau, and control many crimes along with other comrades.Both are not simple story. There are various drama, tragedy, confrontation, and meaningful depictions.Especially Light and L, Kougami and Makishima, their's relationship is the most important point in Original Story.DN's setting is modern. PP's setting is near future. Cities are similar and beautiful.Both have excellent animation, bloody and thrilling. DN focus a battle of the mind, PP focus action scenes. To be drawn into them.Finally, You will receive an impact in a certain episode. read more 
The concept is practically the same. Although it takes a few episodes to get the plot going, both have to do with someone trying to change something that has already been established. As far as death note is concerned you have Light Yagami who wants to kill all criminals to change the world. Psycho pass has Sogo Makishima who believes the sybil system is broken and tries to bring it down with similar means. In each case there is of course someone who tries to stop the respective villains, L on the one side and Akane/Kogami on the other side. 
-Expert detectives -Genius villains trying to make a better worldIf you enjoyed the cat & mouse chase of Death Note and the psychological aspect, you will probably enjoy Psycho Pass. Overall, it is more disturbing to an extent. If you can handle that and want a good crime drama, Psycho-Pass is a good anime.  
Both:-Feature a rivalry between two highly intelligent characters.-Deal with the concepts of good, evil and perfect society.-Are heavily psychological.-Have a similar dark atmosphere.Death Note focuses on it's story the whole way and has a supernatural twist to it, while Psycho-Pass has several sub-plots that tie into the overarching story, and as a sci-fi anime places some focus on world building. It also has plenty of action scenes, unlike Death Note. 
If you enjoyed the mental battle between L and Kira in DeathNote, but haven't seen Psycho-Pass then you're missing out, both are psychological, police, thrillers. The art styles for both are very similar, with a large focus on darker colours. Similarities: - Mental battle between police and a criminal.Differences:- Psycho-pass is set in a Sci-Fi world.- Female protagonist in psycho pass.- Psycho-pass follows the police's point of view, we don't see the criminals plans till they happen. 
Both are thrillers where a villain schemes and plots to remain a step ahead of the pursuing law enforcement.  They each do so while tackling complex themes about how society handles crime and punishment, as well as questioning the motivation and justification behind law enforcement entities.   
Both are very great on showing things about the worst of the society and are very dark in terms of storytelling 
They are both contains very strong element of crime objectivity and justice. There's the same wavelength of seriousness and dark content. Both of them also have detective characters--so everyone will see the familiarity of deductive prowess and psychotic to sociopath level of cast. 
* Both have action and criminal scenes.* Both have genius enemies.* Both have characters how fight to change the state of the world.* Both are unpredictable as the next chapters.* Both have a character how rejects the state of the society.  
These not similar in story-line however they're both a good crime mystery. Psycho-Pass has a more futuristic setting than Death Note. There's also a second season of Psycho-Pass in case you enjoyed the first season (and possibly a third season soon). There's suspense, plot twists and sadness to both stories. One difference between these two animes is that in Psycho-Pass the protagonist is female but similar in that she is working for government/police force. Another difference is that Psycho-Pass is set in the future with futuristic devices and technology and that there is no supernatural presence (Shinigamis). 
In a sense, Psycho-Pass, in my opinion, is a great series =, if you are a hardcore mystery anime veteran. It has thrilling mystery, mind-blowing games of cat and mouse and a sexy male lead (if you know what I mean Hr Hr Hr wink wink Light wink wink) and a dystopian  future which is 'perfect' yet flawed. If you watched Death Note, Psycho-Pass is a great recommendation, and will activate it's Lethal Eliminator on ANYONE, who thinks otherwise.(GROOOOOOAAAAAN!!!!) 
Both animes are based on what is right or wrong. The thought of justice and whether killing criminals is correct, which you see in Death Note - and a society with a perfect system, which you see in Psycho-Pass, but is that for the best? However, when thinking about ethics and morals, both these animes, show a massive insight regarding that topic. 
The psychological battle between ""good"" and ""bad"" in Psycho Pass immediately reminded me of Death Note. Both the main characters in this batle aren't defined in a certain role but are very alike and understand eachother on a different level to predict eachother.Both are weirdos/outsiders that didn't have/like a normal life.Both have a high amount of attention spend on judgement of criminals/people and wether this judgement is or can be correct. 
They both have Great Villains/Anti Heroes. They are both about Crime fighting and solving cases. They have great suspense and would keep you guessing and wondering whats going to happen next. 
If you enjoyed the mystery and detective elements of Death Note, Psycho Pass will scratch that itch and more. Raising very complex questions about morality and freedom while having an engaging story. 
Both series feature police forces trying to catch an enigmatic criminal who always seems to be one step ahead of them, and involve commentary on how society can be strongly affected by the actions of just a handful of people. 
both of these animes have two heroes with different ideology!they both contain smart antihero and hero!they both makes you think about your own beliefs 
Kill, or not to kill. The most notable similarity of these two is judging people. They commit a crime, so they are bad people. The differences are the way power works, whom the power of judging belongs to, and how they use that power for justice.The overall theme is dark, enough to give audiences intensity and chills, triggering audiences' minds to think and judge what's right and what's wrong. These two are not being too similar, yet gives the same vibe. 
If you are looking for a psychological and police thriller, both are excellent.- The two present a psychological clash between villain and hero, in which both sides are intelligent and try to predict the opponent's movements and way of thinking.- Both deliver a debate about human nature. In Death Note, he is more focused on the concept of justice and individual corruption, while in Psycho-Pass, he deals more with the origin of criminality, the law and the utilitarianism of the system, but both have several themes in common within that.- Both present a reflection of the villain's actions in society, although Death Note focuses more on that.- The two works, in addition to the police investigation, work with an element from which the public gradually discovers the rules. In Death Note, it is Note itself, a supernatural element. In Psycho-Pass, it is the Sibyl System and its nature, an element of Sci-Fi. read more 
A lot of mindgames and detective work. 
Both shows feature intriguing examinations of criminal psychology. They both have agencies that aid in the investigation to catch the killer. They both have amazing villains/anti-heroes: Light Yagami and Shougo Makishima. Both feature a fun cat and mouse chase between detective and killer, and the detective and killer in both shows are equally matched and are perfect rivals for each other. 
Both are detective and mystery. They also are a bit twisted in their own way. 
detective but very different tones. Both superb though 
The 2 are based on a dark and deep plot, wanting to know what is good or evil. focusing on protagonists who through the chapters get closer to the final battle, however in the 2 stories the plot continues after this event.Series difficult to see if you are not used to intellectual battles and a bit of existential crisis. Super recommended. 
since my first recomendation was removed for beeing to vague I will need to go into mid level spoilers for deathnote (although youre unlikely to get it) and very light ones for Psycho Pass.people who read this from psycho pass beware.Ready? okay.Both explore a Uptopian/(Dystopian?) Socieity and end up surfacing its weaknesses and flaws(still gonna keep this a bit vague). In both series we have briliant strategists opposing each other in a fight for what is just in their views. The ending also both leave open interesting questions for the viewer (I didnt watch psycho pass s2/3 because I heard bad things about it and dont wanna ruin the series for myself) Both also have a ending that qualifies as one and dont just stop after a random story arc read more 
Both are psychological and thrillerLots of ActionInvolve the police 
If you like the detective theme in one show, you are going to enjoy the other, the difference is Death Note is supernatural and the Psycho-Pass is futuristic.Both have a great intellectual duel going on. 
If you're looking for some anime that are gonna make you reflect on topics like moral, justice and distopic society, they both share this feature.Dark, pressing and passionate, the stories are something unique, the characters are all interesting and well constructed, you can't deny the ""bad"" guys have no logic reasons for what they've doing, actually you're mislead by their thoughts.Who gives us the right to decide who is a criminal and who is not? Who is bad and who acts for the good of a higher purpose? What are good and evil for mankind?Of course these 2 anime present many differences, Death Note is a milestone in anime history so I won't spend too many words on it. Psycho-Pass got 3.5 seasons (+ 4 movies), the 1rst is something terrific and incredibile, the main theme with this new society is presented and the villain is such a meddlesome character that you almost root for him! The 2nd one present some flaws, I guess because it tries to follow the first season, but it appears kinda repetitive and lacking of a good antagonist. Then there are the movies, they're all enjoyable and necessary to construct the premises for the third season: well, I was almost scared of getting disappointedl, but it actually went beyond all my expectations. New topics, new characters working well together, still we won't miss too much the old ones since they make every now and then they're appearance, the episodes last more (I think it was a good choice, so there can be more continuity) but the story is not finished... I'm looking forward to the next season! read more 
Both of these anime have fascinating villains. Each mastermind is intelligent and manipulative. Both villains have their own idea of what justice is. As a viewer, you can't help but question your own views on morality and crime. The villains' actions make you think, and this is great. It's easy to see how power can corrupt someone. Watch these anime if you want to see intelligent, riveting, elusive villains who want to fight injustice with their own ideals. Will they be caught? Will they always outsmart the detectives that are coming for them?  
Giustice is the main theme of these psychological anime 
My friend actually recommended my Psycho-Pass because he knew Death Note was my favourite anime, and I completely agree with him. The first season of psycho pass follows a cat and mouse chase with two foils. Their relationship is somewhat similar to the conflict between light and L (though Kogami and Makishima's relationship feels a tad bit forced and not nearly as well done as in death note).Psycho-Pass is also a show that allows its characters to be morally ambiguous. While Mikishima is evil because he kills innocent people, he chooses to rebel against the system to bring people freedom. The best way to describe Mikishima is if Light's ideals played more into his character.  Overall, I think if you liked Death Note you are sure to find enjoyment in Psycho-Pass.  read more "
13601,467,40,"Psycho-Pass is, perhaps, the closest thing to GitS:SAC that we will ever see. This isn't to accuse PP of mindless copycatting, though; although both shows deal with similar settings and subject matter, as well as have similar direction and audiovisual feel, Psycho-Pass clearly holds its own and even improves upon GitS in terms of pacing and visual flair at times. It may not be up to one's taste, but it's definitely worth checking out, and its handling of the subject matter surely deserves credit either way.Important to say, much like its spiritual predecessor, PP also respects the viewer's intelligence to a remarkable degree, offering mostly natural exposition, believable character conflicts and interactions, deus-ex-machina-free plot, and zero fanservice. A rare gem of an anime for a mature viewer. read more 
Both are procedural crime shows and set in a future version of Japan. Both shows are very focused on sci fi and each has their own interesting gallery of gadgets and systems. Both follow the attempts of a law enforcement agencies attempts to capture an enigmatic criminal who's always several steps ahead. Ghost in the Shell is more episodic and the underlying plot is visited in standalone episodes throughout the season. Psycho Pass is more focused on the main plot. I've heard Psycho Pass get called at best inspired by and at worst a rip off of GitS but I think it's its own show and I'll recommend it as such. If you like detective stories, Sci-fi, and character driven drama you'll like this read more 
Not only the futuristic sci-fi crime investigation team premises (heavy on characterisation) but also the series' structure and execution mirror each other. Ghost in the Shell was one of the many works Psycho Pass' creators were open about having influenced them; one even going so far as to say they wanted to surpass GitS. Even the animation studios (Production IG) are the same.The setting of both is 'a future not far away from our reality'. This means our real world logic is applied to series where full-body cybernisation is possible and artificial intelligence can think for itself. To better connect the viewer, both GitS: Stand Alone Complex and Psycho introduce rookie characters that are left somewhat alienated to those around them. GitS: SAC has Togusa be the human element: all of his teammates having undergone some level of cyberisation, while he refuses and relies only on his wits and revolver. Psycho has Akane play a very similar role where she is left aghast over how calm her superior and subordinates are over killing people, just because a number is high and their 'A.I.' controlled guns tell them to shoot.In terms of the plots, aside from the eventual unraveling of CONSPIRACIES, it's the basic structure that links them. Both shows have main plot threads - The Laughing Man in GitS: SAC and Makishima in Psycho - that are briefly touch upon in earlier, episodic content before they become the main focus as the series' draw towards their climatic conclusions. Along the way, the main characters are explored via 'case of the week' stories. The key difference between the two is that Psycho is about a controlled society, reliant on A.I. to do their thinking for them, where latent criminals are used to catch other criminals. GitS: SAC has a team of (mostly) ex-military badarses investigate terrorism, among other things--Japanese society not being very different from how it is in reality.  read more 
Both take place in a similar futuristic setting, where the lines between technology and humanity are blurred. Both are from the point-of-view of law enforcement, showing society through the eyes of those who see the worst of it. 
Both are set in a plausible futuristic setting focused on some police authority. Action scenes litter throughout both series, and when done, they're brilliantly choreographed. Like any two great sci-fi, both looks critically into the social implications of technology, the ethical considerations, and any significant impact of change in lifestyle. Easily two of the best sci-fi anime has to offer, utmost care was put into both in developing a world that feels real and the characters themselves behave accordingly to the circumstances given. 
Both are crime-solving anime in a similar futuristic setting. Both get very serious and give a commentary on the human condition. 
The Ghost in the Shell and Psycho-Pass franchises are both futuristic, cyberpunk police series with a philosophical nature. They take the point of view of the law enforcement in a world where technology and artificial intelligence is much more advanced and has become an integral part in people's daily lives. They often show the worst of such a world, and leave it up to you whether or not that's what's best for mankind.Ghost in the Shell is very character driven while Psycho-Pass focusses more on the main plot, but if you like one the other should definitely interest you aswell. 
First of all in both cases we have the police as the main characters. Secondly we could say the time period is not too distant cyberpunk style future.Psycho - pass seems to have some interesting philosophical views on this kind of future... It's the kind of anime which actually needs you to think when watching it. Ghost in the shell has multiple story arcs, while Psycho Pass has a single arc which connects it all together.  
Both are set in a futuristic society and both talk about psychology and philosophy extensively.    
Gritty police procedural anime from the same studio. They explore the ramifications of their sci-fi settings on the behavior of people, especially criminals. Two very insightful shows that are absolutely beautiful to look at. Psycho-Pass is more about the challenges in creating a utopia, while Stand Alone Complex explores the effects of technology on individuals. 
Both of these story lines fall deep into the future with technology that can better mankind but also still have the same amount of crime. Characters are a bit different than ghost in a shell however you will learn about the characters in this anime at different episodes just like ghost in a shell.  
Both series shares similar themes involving dealing with criminals in a world with powerful technology. In fact, these traces of technology can be traced with cyperpunk themes. Thus, both series has a similar feeling.Both series' characters works with a superior organization to deal with the criminals using their skills. Production I.G. is also involved with both series hence similar animation artwork and visuals. Both series has action, drama, police, and great dialogue usage in many scenes. 
Both anime have a similar feel to their story telling as well as both being worlds in a not too distant future. Both can also be classified as science fiction and each follow a form of law enforcement. 
Both animes feature an advanced technological society that despite the cutting edge technology suffers from both existential and criminal issues. Both animes feature cybercrime and a lot of action. Both animes focus on police and investigations. 
Aside from being masterpieces of the psychological genre, both series are set in a cyberpunk world and include plenty of thought-provoking philosophical moments and exhilarating action to keep you at the edge of your seat, especially in the later episodes.In short, what truly sets either of these series above the average anime and makes the other absolutely worth watching if you wholeheartedly enjoyed one, is how there is neither black nor white characterization and character morals, in addition to unpredictable plot direction... By the end of the series (particularly in Psycho-Pass imo) you may end up rooting for what you (as the viewer) believe is the best course of action for the respective content's humanity, as opposed to what is ""justice"" or some commonly accepted ideology. Find out for yourself; enjoy! read more 
The atmosphere is very similar, with mature and complex characters, in these two series there is room for both, action and philosophy. 
Both are in the future, have to deal in a sci-fi genre and deal with aspects of philosophy. Specifically, they deal with the philosophy of current life and future life. Both also have great, almost similar artwork (minus characters). 
They're both set in futuristic/cyberpunk type worlds (although PP seems a few decades behind GITS technology-wise) and focus on law enforcement, while also delving into themes like grey morality. The main difference is in the main theme; where GITS focuses on the idea of individualism in an increasingly connected world, PP chooses to explore the idea of freedom vs security. If you liked one it's a high chance you'll like the other. 
Both of these anime are set in the future and deal with law enforcement. Ghost in the Shell revolves more around how we are losing our grip on humanity compared to how horrifying humanity is in the future with Psycho Pass. Both of these anime also have underlying meanings that really strike a chord when they are finally understood. 
Both are about police investigation. They both set up in a sci-fi world. They both have a strong squad that each member have his speciality. 
Great world building for future crime fighting, integrating future technologies into society. This creates a utopia/dystopia in both worlds. Questions arise about how technologies should be used and how society should be governed to regulate such abuse or misuse. (more pronounced in Psycho Pass)Both have strong female MCs (GITS a little stronger) and an interactive unit/team to introduce interesting characters and dialogue/ideology. (PP is stronger in character development, GITS in dialogue)  
There are some major parallels to draw between the two shows. Both feature a team of police detectives in a near future world, hunting down criminals, often of a cyber nature. They do this using futuristic technology, which feels pretty similar between the two shows. The action scenes in both shows also manages to feel pretty similar.There's two major differences between the shows. First, the story setup is different. Psyco-Pass being focused around measuring a person's criminal tendencies, while GitS: S.A.C is focused around equal rights for androids, and explores if androids are able to have souls and feel emotions.The second big difference would be the art style, which ends up being more realistic in GitS, and slightly more stylized in Psycho-Pass. read more 
If You liked one, then you will definitely like the other. Both these anime's take place in a future society that have advanced technological marvels that can satisfy the most hard core of sci-fi fans. Both anime's are suited for a more mature audience and depict police procedurals in a similar fashion.Ghost in the shell is more action packed or at least the action is on a different scale, while Psycho-pass is more philosophical about society, not that SAC doesn't do the same in it's own way.Bottom line is both of these anime's give off a very similar vibe and they they were intact made by the same company, but only about a decade apart. read more 
Both of them are masterpieces of the Sci-Fi genre.Both of them revolve around agencies that deal with criminals in complex and mostly dystopian futures.Both of them are incredibly well written, the characters have a lot of depth to them, the settings they take place in are so vividly detailed and fascinating that they make you wish you could be part of such a future.They are both some of the best produced anime out there.Psycho-Pass obviously takes a lot of inspiration from Ghost in The Shell, but both Psycho-Pass and Ghost in the Shell have distinct voices and they are in no way the same thing.Both of them have memorable soundtracks.Both of them are action packed, filled with thought provoking moments, psychological thrill rides and excitement or despair lurks at every corner. read more 
Its easy to see how Psycho-Pass was inspired by Ghost in the Shell (1st Season)OB; objective similarities SUB; based on my personal experience.-Similar in the world-building; both shows have a cyber-society dominated by technology . (OB)-Presentation of the Police cyber-crime exists in both shows, a criminal that uses cyber technology in a stand-alone episodes, that is not part of the main arc. (OB)-Both shows have a special team (division) to deal with such crimes (OB)-Minor Spoiler BEWARE --------- there is a corrupt political operating system in both shows. (OB)-Both shows have a main villain (cat-mouse type). (OB)-The use of technology however is more logical in Ghost in the Shell (SUB)-More realistic turn of events and more focus on politics in ghost in the shell than psycho-pass. (SUB)-Similar villains but Psycho-pass villain has more screen time and is more interesting. (SUB)-More focus on the main arc in Psycho-Pass than GitS (OB)I Hope this was useful. read more 
They are both made by Production IG.They are both cyberpunk police showsThe main character is female in both series (Tsunemori Akane for Psycho-Pass and Kusanagi  for GITS)They are both very philosofical and psychological 
Both are set in cyber world's that rely on machines in some way or another. I believe Psycho Pass is heavily inspired by GITS as well and in some ways a more modern, less complicated variation to the classic series. 
- Both deal with a futuristic society.- Both have similar motifs.- Both are cyberized.- Both have action for engagement.- Both deal with a stand alone complex in some sort of way. 
When it comes cyberpunk settings anime, these two are a must watch. Futuristic police and government action, not to forget the fact that both anime franchises were created by Production I.G. Both series have female lead characters, something you don't come across a lot in anime.  
GiTS: SAC and Psycho-Pass are similar Police, Drama and Psychological shows, which deal with some of the same themes. Both shows have the same pacing and only go out of hand at the end of the story. 
Both focus on a story set in the future and revolve around solving crimes commited. Both deal with very realistic conflicts and believable characters that keep you gripped from the beginning of the show till the very end. The paces of both are a little different but otherwise they share quite a few similarities. Psycho Pass is probably the closest thing in anime to GitS. 
Both are set in a futuristic setting and aired with the same studio. They both deal with philosophies and have a very similar feel to storytelling.  
Futuristic worlds where the advanced technology should be supposed to protect us from all evil and create perfect societies, but the reality isn't always that simple. Corruption lurks in every corner and a villain/master-mind appears in an attempt to deliver his own justice.That's where the special investigation teams come up. Consisting of a bunch of agents with open mindsets and different levels of experience dealing with crimes have their ideology tested to prevent the villain's actions.While solving multiple small cases leading to the master-mind, both teams get a step closer to uncovering the truth. However, the case is not as simple as capturing a bad guy.Basically, you will get a similar type of investigation-centered anime with tons of action and some deep dialogs/questions that will amuse you and maybe create some empathy with the villain's ideology. read more 
Both Psycho Pass and GiTS SAC are brilliant action and police anime with a specific focus on law and order and exploring the morality and efficiency of the systems of justice set in place. Anyone who adores well-written police/psychological and cyberpunk anime should watch both Psycho Pass and GiTS. 
Similar cyberpunk setting, brings up themes of society and other philosophical questions 
Both take place in a cyberpunk dystopian Japan and follow a special police task force’s activities. Each episode, the characters responded to different incidents that end up being interrelated with each other. I can’t really say too much more without spoilers. 
These two series are police orientated with a group of characters solving mysteries and kicking ass.Both of these series concentrate on philosophical questions that make you really use your mind to connect things together and goes on about what it truly means to be human   
Psycho-Pass borrows very heavily from Ghost in the Shell SAC's structure, in which police forces in futuristic cyberpunk worlds deal with new forms of crime committed using technology that interacts with the human brain, and their members must come to terms with their roles in this conflict. 
Aired by the same producers, has the same future feel. Both aren't afraid to experiment with something. Of course, SAC is an absolute classic. 
Both are from future, about problems in society.  "
13601,13125,39,"future utopian/dystopian setting where the question is whether the sacrifices made to personal freedom are really worth the peaceful lifestyle, plus the main character must decide how to deal with the cracks in the system 
Psychological horror type anime set in a seemingly utopian future. However, that ""utopia"" turns out to be tragically flawed, and the unusually collected heroine is caught in the middle of everything wrong with her society. 
Perfect society has finally been created. Or so it seems. Is everything really as perfect as it is made to seem? 
These animes are miles apart in terms of universe and atmosphere, but they share similar themes comon to stories set in dystopian speculative futures. Also, they both feature a female lead valued for her exceptional resilience.  
We are presented a seemingly utopian society in which everyday hardships seem to be a thing of the past. Clearly, this society is far from perfect and holds some dark secrets. As the mystery unravels, the pitfalls of the supposedly perfect society are explored in frightening detail. Dystopian fiction at its finest. 
Unsettling psychological stories set in the future.  The female lead is a discontented participant in her society, but she accepts it, rather than try to change it.  Their governments/leaders keep a terrible secret, and monitor and tightly control citizens' behavior in an attempt to create a utopia.  Deviants are eliminated. 
The similarities aren't immediately apparent due to the differences in delivery, and I certainly didn't see them at first. After all, one is a cyberpunk crime show, and the other is a coming-of-age story set in a countryside village. However, as the plots unravel, the similarities become more and more apparent. Both are dystopian tales about flawed systems; both deal with the theme of removing threats before they exist, and both delve heavily into human nature and society. The main female leads are also incredibly similar due to their strength and resilience. Both are prime examples of psychological anime, and if you like one, then you're sure to like the other! read more 
A world that at first sight might seem an utopia, but turns out to be built at such a cost that it is questionable whether it is actually worth it. I would recommend both to anyone interested in dystopian stories. The main difference between the stories (apart from the world they're in) is the pacing. While Psycho Pass drops you off in the middle of the story Shinsekai Yori slowly eases you into the story and lets you grow accustomed to the world first. 
similarities:-dystopian theme-the setting seems to at first be a peaceful and good world but as the shows go on it is revieled that the worlds are built on questionable morals-art qualitydifferences:-psycho pass has more action/shinsekai yore is more calm-characters age (psychopass's characters are older)-antagonist (in psychopass, other then the dystopian society, there is also a human antagonist/in shinsekai yori the antagonist is only the dystopian society) 
Shows that present dystopian societies in the future, where moral values are suppressed in favor of maintaining peace and order within the society. The line between right and wrong is very ambiguous. Viewers may strongly sympathize with the antagonists, who may have legitimate reasons to revolt against the authority. 
Both refer to an ideal for human society, demonstrating how humans always strive to find a world that they believe best for them. The values aren't agreed upon by everyone though, and a group of protagonists' thinking break outside of the box they're being enclosed in. Very thought-provoking.  
The main character has to deal with similar issues such as injustice. She takes part in leading the nation to a better future as well. 
Both of these anime are modern representations of classic 20th-century dystopian satires: Psycho-Pass is comparable to the 1949 novel ""Nineteen Eighty-Four"" by George Orwell, and Shinsekai yori is comparable to the 1932 novel ""Brave New World"" by Aldous Huxley. As such, these stories caution humanity of the consequences of extreme and unchecked advances in science and technology. They show how the unrestricted indulgence of and reliance on the futuristic systems can negatively impact society, and even humanity itself. This includes the subsequent suffering of the individuals who desperately try to oppose/conform to said systems. 
-the responsible female protagonist has to come to terms with and enforce the Utopia/Dystopia that she resides in, in the process shaping her morales and becoming very strong and capable.-strict observation of psychological health of citizens-allusions to psychological works and conditions-lots of death and dying, and obviously tragedy as well.-and the questioning of the morality of death punishment-there was a team of five--and more similarities but I don't want to make this a spoiler.-homosexual relationships in the teamOf course, one has a brilliant twisted villain, the other has [i wont spoil it]. One is tron-like, the other is traditional/villagey.The team dynamics in each are completely different. read more 
Similarities:Both deal with the protagonist finding out the hidden nature of their 'perfect world'. This causes them to go through many near death experiences. On the way some friends die, as result of the sybil system or the ethics committee covering up evidence. In the end both have to learn to deal with the fact that is how society is currently but hope for change in the future.Differences:Setting:Psycho pass is set in a somewhat more futuristic world than today.Shin sekai yori, although 1000 or so into the future, do not rely on technology and have no 'concrete buildings'.Powers:In Psycho pass, the Denominators give them power.In Shin sekai yori, human have psycho kinesis (something along those lines) read more 
Both shows settings are in a futuristic utopia where people get killed for having the potential to do harm even if they've done nothing wrong. Psycho-pass is more of law enforcement type thriller where as shinsekai yori has more of a darker mood than that. Two of my favorite shows for sure! 
They're both about future controlled societies whose maintainers have great fear that they could be destroyed by any one person. Hence, they zealously dispose of people who have any chance of causing trouble. The main character in each is thrown into a crisis, despite being inexperienced. 
Both anime are about dystopian societies that base their legal system on the risk of committing a crime and extensive information control with the intention of preventing people from learning things that could risk the order of society. In both anime, the government is shown to have reason to act the way they do, but it never really is fully justified. Finally, the weaknesses of both societies are exploited to great harm to the population. 
Both animes try to explain how the world could be with other conditions and show us how dark could be our own mind to reach the peace in society. Saki and Tsunemori (main characters) are so similar.*sorry for my bad English* 
Dystopian societies where moral is neglected by the system to protect an inhuman peace. Both stories are almost prophetic - one in Evolution and one in Cyberization. Main female leads have identical state of mind, potential, and development. Similar endings. Brilliant stories that can make you pant in shock and excitement while at the same time promoting critical thinking with credible arguments from all sides involved. 
Both anime events take place at the future, while in Shinsekai Yori it is more distant future and it has more mystery, but in Psycho-Pass it is a lot more of semi-perfect technology. Akane and Saki discover some not nice secrets about the system and learning the flaws they are making a choice if they should support the system or not. These two have very common feeling and the atmosphere. 
The similarities between those 2 shows are basically impossible to miss, hence a recommendation is obvious, especially considering the equally high quality.Personally i found Psycho-Pass´s thriller storyline to be a bit more polished and clean, while Shinsekai Yori feels far richer in imagery and symbolism. 
Both anime are about perfect societies that were formed based on chaos formed by humanity, but it seems as if the perfect society that is so highly praised has dark secrets and isn't as perfect as it seems..... 
Both series is set in the near future where their societies are corrupt. Both series have psychological genres that make you think and question the human race. 
An utopia and perfect system, which reigns the whole society and has no flaws is the setting for both series. Well, that's what you might think when you see it for the first time. Because later in the series you find out that these seeming ""perfect systems"" are actually flawed and far from being perfect. In both series, the governments keep a terrible secret from everyone. Saki and Akane, the main heroines, are taught about the flaws and have to decide how to deal with them.Even though both series are set in the future, they have a very different style (futuristic setting in Psycho-Pass/village life in Shinsekai yori).If you liked Shinsekai yori, I would definitely recommend you Psycho-Pass. read more 
Within a dystopian society, governments or some sort of stratification hierarchy can easily enforce a certain way of life among its civilians and dictate how one should behave and interact. Most importantly, determine one's purpose. Those who refuse to abide these rules are often shunned and ostracized by society, only to be cast aside and perceived as monsters. Saki and Akane are individuals who grow up and live within these societies. These female protagonists share many similar traits, and through the course of their development they begin to become aware and accepting of the harsh realities around them. However, Shinsekai Yori is more of a supernatural coming of age story that focuses on a group of friends and how their relationships change as they grow up within a flawed society. Shinsekai Yori's storytelling is somewhat nonlinear and the pieces aren't put together nicely right away. Whereas, Psycho-Pass focuses more on a single individual working for the police and her feelings towards the system. Both series does a great job of offering philosophical musings, but it is more distinguished and craftily done in Shinsekai Yori.  read more 
The societies set up within both anime try to achieve a utopia. However, trying to attain their utopia leads the people of their society to question if their peace is righteous. Questions like ""what is peace?"" and ""who are we fighting against?"" lies in wait for those trying to obtain true peace. 
 Shinsekai Yori share the same theme of an utopian future, which is revealed to be a illusion and build upon something much worse. Both Anime explore such a future, as well as the wrongdoings of humanity as a whole. 
The similarity of the premise is about utopia-dystopia. And the first thing that comes to mind when hearing back the name Psycho Pass is definitely the power of the SyBIL system. SyBIL is an ideal system that controls the substance of human beings covering all things in it to realize the perfect system of society and governance, although it is essentially impossible, that is the name utopia leads to dystopia. The ideal world is a very desirable dream, but it is almost impossible to make it happen that various laws and norms should be ignored in order to make it happen. Psycho Pas illustrates that the actual form of dystopia exists in utopia. Such concept is actually almost the same as Shinsekai Yori and even its implementation exists, but the presentation is much different. Psycho Pass reveals dystopia in the modern world while Shinsekai Yori tends to paradoxize against the modern world (conservative) read more 
while Shinsekai yori pushes more of a pure fantasy angle than the very sci-fi Psycho-pass, both are enjoyable for their equal dedication to their worldbuilding and main characters. I've always found dystopian and utopian settings fascinating, and these series go about painting a vivid and convincing picture of such settings in different ways, each raising many fundamental moral questions about what social and political freedom mean.at the core of each series are two pretty similar characters, both young women, both unusually inquisitive and levelheaded compared to their peers. in my case, the protagonists being so relatable helped draw me further into their respective worlds, though I have heard of others being a little alienated by the choice of protagonist (in some cases due to their gender, in others, their personalities)in terms of their aesthetic, the two series could barely be more different: Psycho-pass opts for a bold style of drawing faces (especially eyes) and high-contrast designs and environments, often with very dark colours; Shinsekai yori has a style that wouldn't feel out of place in a shoujo anime and is on average more colourful, but does turn to more muted palettes when it suits. both use their style and visual/auditory repetition to spectacular effect which make for beautiful, emotional and sometimes artfully jarring scenes.in summary: they're not a total match-up, but it's definitely worth watching them both if only to see how differently two very similar heroines interact with two drastically different futuristic settings. read more 
Although quite different, if you liked the vision of the future in Psycho Pass, you can enjoy Shinsekai Yori for this same reason. The two worlds are very different, but it's this particular vision of the future that I loved in these two animes. In addition, I particularly enjoyed the development of the characters in Shinsekai Yori. 
Both MCs have ability to quickly recover from stress.Both animes are set in future dystopian worlds, where people are destined to die, if they pose a threat for society. 
These two shows both have a similar feel and also have good endings even if Psycho-Pass is not a final ending—just a suitable ending. The situation in the anime is also similar with only the top people knowing everything, and the protagonist being a newcomer (a child and new to a company). 
The whole plot is like things that ppl thought it is perfect later turn to be serious issue that society should reconsider.   
Both stories take place in a future dystopian setting where the society is conformed to the ideal society when the main character becomes the one who is exposed to the flaws/corruption that is present within their society 
You'll see a familiar main character, who has an nontrivial possibilities to stay stable in such a distopian society    
Both anime have a similar world setting. Both shows are set in an utopian world which is actually a dystopia. There's a certain stress limit which can't be crossed. If anyone crosses that limit then they're considered to be harmful for the society and are to be eradicated. 
Both are dystopias, set in the future, and have similar moral dilemmas. In my opinion, Shinsekai yori is better in nearly every way, but both are worth a watch if you like morally-intriguing and dark stories/scenarios  
both happen in a utopian/dystopian future, while psycho-pass is more futuristic. both have excellent villains. "
13601,43,15,"Both are in future where science has developed in a realistic way (meaning it's possible it could happen when looking now) and in a way that has changed the society. Both concentrate a lot on the psycholocical aspects of those changes. 
-Both series feature high-tech equipment-Both series were produced by Production I.G.-Both series have cyborgs and robots-Both series feature a wide variety of themes-Both series have great plots 
There are two work produced by Production IG, type Action, Sci-Fi, Police.Artwork antisipation deal about the evolution of human behavior and society in parallel with the technological advances and problems that responsibility.(translated from french) 
Both take place in post apacolyptic setting, includes adavanced robots/AI and has a good and action packed story 
I recommend it because it's in the same cyberpunk and psychological sphere. 
both are similar in action and having strong female lead characters. 
Both of these anime have similar settings, and feature a smart female detective as the leading protagonist. They have similar themes about the problems prevalent in a society which relies too heavily on technology. After all, there are always bugs or loopholes that can be taken advantage of. The art and sound in both are brilliant as well. Finally, the most notable similarity are the heavy philosophical themes in both shows. GitS and PP both analyze human society, and also try to define humanity itself. 
If you like sci-fi thrillers that involve complex plots and dilemmas for an hypotetic future civilization, with philosophyc touches, this is what you are looking for. Both are about police units and their struggles to resolve complex crimes. Both have a great ambientation with strong cyberpunk inspiration. Both soundtracks are great. Both have a great plot and characters. 
Both introductions to carefully crafted universes, that seduce you through their effervescent world building and master class study of the hypothetically futuristic human condition, and never quite let go. 
A cyberpunk relation regarding both shows is established, as well as a futuristic setting. The formulation of thought apropos human thought; what it is to be human Vs the 'society', how the society would view you for being any different from anyone else. One may recommend SAC (Ghost in the shell), but the movie is a much better relation. 
They both take place in a similar futuristic setting and ask questions about society. 
Psychology based on robot and ia through sf 
Both deal with a futuristic setting and deal with the philosophy of humanity, morality and choices. 
Both deal with philosopical questions, have rather violent and graphic content and if you liked Ghost in the shell id guess you'll love Psyco pass since it actualy has a gripping narration and plot progression unlike ghost in the shell wich looses itself a bit to much in dialouge. 
Great philosophy. Mind boggling plot and visuals. And also its detective/police works. I fr am at loss of words because this is a MASTERPIECE.  "
13601,19,14,"Both Monster and Psycho-Pass are psychological mystery thrillers were the main male protagonist is after a ghost murder. No one believes in the existence of mastermind serial killer until late. The lead killers both kill as a third party using others to do their dirty work for excitement excitement. Furthermore they see nothing wrong in their ways are are in essence pure heart-ed but evil in soul. You can judge them by their presence.  
Uncommon seinen anime in detective genre with dark mysterous atmosphere. Characters are interesting and psychologically realistic. Protagonist is forced to make difficult choices that are beyond good and evil. In both anime there is an antogonist who tries to fulfil his vile plans and fights either with the main character or with entire society itself. 
Psycho-Pass and Monster both ask and present difficult questions to their viewers and reward them through effortless storytelling and admirable characters. The rules and expectations of society, the darkness that resides inside of humans, the unpredictability of individuals, the corrupt nature of those that lead the masses—all of these are brought to the forefront of these anime and are intriguingly approached through intellectual plots.Situation and history, action and result, no matter how I looked at it, I could not personally decide whether or not either side was ever truly right or wrong. That thin line between the two is my favorite kind of conclusion. At the end of both stories, I found myself admiring the antagonists and protagonists equally; the development of such brilliant characters to challenge each other is nothing short of amazing.Whether you've seen Monster or Psycho-Pass, I greatly recommend both to you. Monster used a much longer series to mesmerize its watchers (and I loved that they did), but the brevity that Psycho-Pass employed is breathtaking in its own right. Do consider both of these series, and join me in questioning just what it is that you believe in. Thank you. read more 
1- Both plots contains Psychopath - no Conscience and very intelligent puppet master.2- Each episode reveals more background story of the main characters.3- Well written and interesting to watch. 
The main malefactors seem alike, IMHO. They both have a global plan and ruin a lot of lives without any doubts. They both prefer to play with people's psychology. I hate both Johan and Makishima.Both series are also serious, clever and for adults only.  
Both of them are police/mystery/psychological anime and are about a chase against a mastermind sociopath. Both of them have an antagonist that has the goal to chance their society and the MC's point of view on it. Both of them are about an MC that is rejected by society but still fights to protect it. 
  Both of these shows involve catching a very smart and charismatic criminal. Both shows also delve into big societal issues and the underlying shortcomings of human nature. Psycho-Pass is much faster paced overall, and has more action, while Monster progresses slowly and likes to focus on its many side characters and side stories, with huge payoffs later on. Both shows also have terrific voice acting (both sub and dub) and extremely well-written dialogue. 
The antagonists of both these shows are highly charismatic and manipulative.  
Both shows have a really similar feel with a ""ghost antagonist"" being hunted down. 
Monster explored human nature and the identity of evil. Psycho Pass explores similar themes in a dystopian setting where the government prevent crimes by calculating the mental state of its citizens. If you enjoyed the psychological aspect of Monster but wanted more action, then Psycho Pass is a must watch.  
if youre mainly looking for anime with psychopaths being the main antagonist then monster and psychopass are similar. both anime have a revenge plot as well. 
-Both Monster and PP are psychological thriller detective anime. -Perhaps the most similar thing about these two shows are the main antagonists, Makishima and Johan. Both of these antagonists are extremely well-written, they're both charismatic. You can't help but admire these antagonists.-They both delve into human society, albeit Monster has a more realistic approach to it because PP is taken place in the future.All in all, both of these shows are very similar, however, Monster is more dialogue-heavy and longer than PP, it's also slower paced. PP in the other hand is more action-oriented and is faster paced. Either way, both of these shows are amazing, and I hope you'll enjoy them. read more 
If you like the mystery elements of psycho pass then you might like monster.  Compared to Psycho pass, monster follows a realistic approach (set during the 1980s) and follow a young man trying to prove himself not guilty of a crime he did not commit. Also the main antagonist in monster is as good (if not better) as the one in psycho pass.  Also keep in mind that the animation for monster is a bit old since it was produced during the early 2000's.  
Both of them has a very similar dark tone, theme, and story. Each of the villain is the greatest villain in the genre with great backstory and motives. Monster tend to focus on the more realistic side of the story while Psycho Pass approach is through futuristic cyberpunk technology. Both of them discuss the issue of justice and truth, which is uncertain "
13601,1,13,"Both Protagonists are kinda labeled as the anti-heroes and both have a dark past which both have antagonists that can be compared to with Vicious and Makishima. Set in a futuristic world with a Noir atmosphere, its a must see! 
Both anime share a near future setting where technology has an important role in society. Kougami is a character similar to Spike in the way they think and both have an archnemesis which wants to play with their mind and twist it.Cowboy Bebop has a unique style, while Psycho-Pass tries to put the viewer to reason about society.  Psycho-Pass will surely not disappoint Cowboy Bebop fans. 
Psycho-Pass has that dark futuristic adult story telling just like Cowboy Bebop minus the Jazz. 
Both series are set in the future and center around police work, cowboy bebop specifically bounty hunting. Kougami and Spike are very similar in personality as well as Makishima and Vicious. 
How do I put this... Cowboy Bebop is like the tv series Firefly but grittier and cooler. Psycho-Pass has a Cowboy Bebop feel but it's like a mix o Bebop, Bladerunner and the Minority Report with a tad of Equilibrium thrown in there. Both are Sci-Fi, both have the ""cool"" factor, and both are filled with great animation, music and characters.If you love either of these then I really can't imagine not loving the other. Both are amazing action Sci-Fi series! 
story is not related..hands downbut i found the main characters similarspike spiegel = shinya Kougamiboth have a dark pastthe arch nemesis of both the characters are similar in some ways to the protagonist in either of the seriesall in all its a must watch!!psycho pass has a great story 
-Both series take place in the near future-Both series have a main male protagonist who uses guns and has a badass attitude (Spike being the layed-back, energetic kind while Shinya is the more calm, collected kind)-Both series have great action scenes 
»Dark tone»Action-oriented»Cast of very likable characters»Strong male lead with reckless behavior and great skill»Strong antagonist role with twisted ties to the male lead»Plot revolves around the main characters hunting down and chasing criminals»Futuristic setting»Great English dub 
Both Spike and Kogami remind me of one another- dark past - enemy they're bent on getting revenge on for hurting someone they cared for The supporting characters are also interesting bc like cowboy bebop, each supporting character has their own stories that are told Also set in the future, with action/crime elements embedded in both  
If you liked Psycho-Pass's characters, you will likely like Cowboy Bebop's characters. Spike Spiegel and Shinya Kougami have an almost exact personality match, except Spike is a little more... humorous. Vicious and Shōgo Makishima are also very similar in terms of intelligence and looks. Shōgo is definitely more cunning. Jet Black and Nobuchika Ginoza are also very similar. They have a similar backstory, overall demeanor and even looks. Both Spike and Shinya are main protagonists and both Shogo and Vicious are main antagonists. Spike and Jet's companionship is similar to Shinya and Nobuchika's companionship. There's not really too many similarities beyond that other than the dark vibes from both shows.You should watch Cowboy Bebop anyways for nothing else if you've never seen it. It's considered one of the many classics of anime history. read more 
Though Psycho-Pass takes many cues from Ghost in the Shell and has a concept of ruling the system with the status quo identical to that of Death Note as opposed by the antagonist, it too with the rivalry of Kogami vs Makishima related to Spike vs Vicious.After being affected by a certain tragedy, Kogami and Spike pursue their career with a crew dealing with various villains in an episodic fashion leading to their confrontation from the past as Makishima and Vicious rolls in. Akane like Faye are the main female leads who have yet to experience a harsh fact of reality of their life and careerGinoza like Jet shares a friendly dynamic sidekick with the mc Shion shares most of the techy and monitoring the gang's actions with EdwardFor some reason, Urobuchi is a fan of Bebop and I take it that this for some reason is the reincarnation of Bebop in a sci fi setting and the only difference is that the main cast is now working for the government to enforce justice to maintain the status quo. read more 
You get a very similar thrill watching Psycho Pass as you do with Cowboy Bebop. It also has to be said that watching the battle between one of the main protagonists and the antagonist feels like deja vu.  
Part of what makes Cowboy Bebop so great is its leading protagonist, Spike. We know about his dark past and throughout the show he's sort of labeled as an anti-hero. The same could be said of Psycho-Pass, who's lead is similarly dark. The setting is fairly similar in that it's futuristic and has a noir feel to it. The entire show revolves around a new kind of policing that determines the state of mind of citizens before they even commit a crime. However, this system seems to have some serious faults.  "
13601,10087,9,"Two men who undertand each other more than anyone else but have completely opposite goals. 
Made by the same writer. Both have amazing art and some of the characters and plot are similar even though their settings are different (Psycho-Pass: sci-fi, Fate/Zero: supernatural). 
same author, incredibly deep stories, awesome action. just incredible anime 
Both series written by Gen Urobuchi, which contain dark themes of murder and death. They are both thrillers and are somewhat similar in terms of having rogue lead characters. 
Both Psycho-Pass and Fate/Zero share equally compelling main characters, who make you question your perspective; both anime also feature gory and dark atmospheres, courtesy of them sharing the same creator. 
Both are mature anime written by Gen Urobuchi. The male characters are strikingly similar from each show. Kogami and Mashikima from Psycho-Pass mirror Kiritsugu and Kirei respectively from Fate/Zero extremely well. In their respective shows, they are men who are the same at the core of what they do but their goals clash and thus so do their similar personalities.  
At the center of both anime is a rivalry between two men. Men that have never spoken to or met eachother, but know eachother better than anyone. They hate eachother, because they're similar. They hate eachother because they hate themselves. Yet they represent different ideals, nor do they truly understand eachother.Both are written by the same author, have a similar feel to them, have similar characters and most of the story takes place in various encounters across a large city. 
Both are written by Gen Urobuchi, and the enmity between Kougami Shinya and Makishima Shougo is similar to that of Emiya Kiritsugu and Kotomine Kirei, one that of similarity between both parties though they couldn't understand each other. 
After finishing seasons 1 & 2 of Fate/Zero, I noticed themes similar to Psycho-Pass:- written by the same author (Gen Urobuchi)- both have a very dark atmosphere- both have a very deep and well-written story- both feature rivalries between 2 similar men with clashing ideologies- both have a decent amount of action- both make you question the morality of certain characters' actionsAll in all, if you liked the dark atmosphere and great story of one anime, you will probably enjoy the other. "
13601,9253,4,"Both anime are dark/realistc style, with good characters and some mistery.one is about time machine and the other about the mafia above the security system. 
    The worlds of Psycho-Pass and Steins;Gate are both science fiction worlds which each seems relatively realistic. They are also more serious with little or no comedy and have very good character development  
Both series are psychological thrillers that have rewarding payoffs as the series progresses. in both series, there is a greater system/organisation that has a secret that is slowly discovered as the series progresses. 
mystery oriented focus on science fiction likable cast and also unexpected plotwists "
13601,1575,3,"- Both has an unjust justice system that almost does not give a damn about victims and casualties..- Both does not shy from showing you death mercilessly- Both anime shows some MC that defy the current laws and standard of society. 
Both have the same premise of bringing down a corrupt government and questions whether it's better to bring it down from outside or work from within to change it. Both have psychological and ideological themes that will have you thinking about for a long time after you've finished watching and make a point to confuse you about whether the ends or the means are correct (Code Geass is more emphatic on this) and that not everything is black and white (well duh): you'll have to reflect and decide on your own about what you think is right.As for differences, Psycho-Pass lacks the super-powered piloted robots in Code Geass but makes up for it using ""Dominators"" (huge badass guns, basically). Psycho-Pass surpasses CG in terms of artwork and animation by far, however. PP also doesn't mess up its characters arcs like Code Geass (although CG's first season is better than the second in terms of this). read more

13601,801,3,"Both are from Production I.G and have the similar futuristic police thriller theme to it. In Psycho-Pass the police's special team that are comprised of Enforcers who are latent criminals who are specialized to hunt down other latent criminals. In Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex: 2nd Gig this special unit works for the organization called Public Security Section 9; a division that exist under the Ministry of Home Affairs. The unit is a group who specializes in fighting technology-related crimes like cyberterrorism. Both have a cyberpunk setting. 
Both revolve around a police department in a cyberpunk world, and deal heavily with political themes.  
Both from future, deep, tackles problems in society. I like 2nd GIG more than the 1st GIG "
13601,11741,2,"both works are by Gen Urobuchi which displays amazing plot. Each anime contains certain elements and tragic plot twist that captivates the readers and also displays brilliant animation. 
Both anime questions philosophical things. ""What is justice?"" and ""What is the most important thing to yourself? Is it your idealism or....""  "
13601,6114,2,"While Psycho-Pass revolves more around chasing a criminal and Rainbow is more about the life and friendship of seven prisoners, both series center around laws and have criminals as their main theme, and explores both themes pretty nicely. 
Rainbow is a psychological action show with a great animation and story. The show is not mainly focused on action. It also about friendship, courage, pride and about their fight against society. Psycho Pass is also a great show with a very good animation. The shows are similar because of the influence of the government. The difference is that in Rainbow it's about the seven boys and their battle against the system. In Psycho Pass, the MC's are part of the system themselves. The shows may look very different at first, but after watching them I felt they had a lot in common. "

40052,1,6,"The entire time watching Great Pretender, it reminded me of Cowboy Bebop. Similar vibes (except the melancholy romance in CB was not present) where people with different personalities & background teaming up to do bad things. The opening songs are also similar. 
Strong people doing dangerous things.Both deal with A-class crime and tragedy. Pretty cool character development.Spike and Laurant can share similarities. They're so handsome and have very hard pasts.Opening visuals and music also very similar. GP is influenced by CB, I guess.CB has better story but GP has better visuals. Each Western and American style will attract you. 
The generally episodic nature of Great Pretender (GP) and Cowboy Bepop (CB) are very similar! Great character focus and development so far in GP and of course in CB as well. Nice mini series within an overarching narrative in both pieces. Great heist vibes jive well with futuristic bounty hunting, though wildly different, they meld well together. Great music in both!If you like either CB or GP you defs need to watch both for sure! 
Both of these stories put a heavy emphasis on character development and how the character's past has shaped them. 
For me, Great Pretender had this vibe that reminded me alot of Cowboy Bebop. The story is in some ways comparable and just an all around fun to watch show. 
The energy that the show gives if is honestly very similar with its own new, refreshing style, if you liked cowboy beepop i highly recommend "
40052,2251,6,"Both series feature entertaining and fast paced story where at one point everything just makes sense and it's just fun to watch. Great Pretender's build up is a lot faster than in Baccano and features more con men thief characters. Similar music style, especially the openings.  
Jazz never bored. As long as old people exist.Both are written about foreign mafia's slapstick stories. Atmospheres also very similar. Especially opening.Not only America but every foreign places are part of settings in both shows. Very intriguing.GP is more realistic. You can understand why GP is comedy in whole. Baccano! is darker and bloody.Both have powerful entertainment. GP is 2020 version of Baccano! IMO. I hope you love it. 
Have a very similar Tarantino esc like energy and the whole American criminal element is similarly mimickedExcept in Baccano it focuses on prohibition era New York instead the whole worldIt also has a similar Jazzy soundtrackIt obviously misses some of the hip hop tracks that Great Pretender uses but overall it's similarBasically if you like the pacing, energy and character focus of the series as well as the soundtrack you'll like BaccanoJust prepare for something more like Pulp Fiction instead of Jackie Brown with the story being told out of order 
Jazz & crimes goes together like macaroni & cheese. Baccano! and Great Pretender are both shows about criminals doing criminal things, but somehow they make it mesmerizing to watch. The two have have extremely original and well written casts that kind of makes you want to root for the ''bad guys''. Finally, they both have amazing soundtracks.  
-> Great ensemble cast in both series-> Jazzy openings-> Both are terrific crime-comedy dramas-> Baccano! is some weird combination of FMA:B, Steins;Gate, Pulp Fiction and Snatch-> Great Pretender is like Ocean's 11, but with more comedy 
Great pretender is a must watch anime for baccano! lovers , to know the reasons check other recommendations. "

If you're a big fan of Banana Fish, you will love GP. Vice versa. 
Both have a blonde man and a japanese man, include mafia stuff, drama, police etc etc ITS SO GOOD 
An innocent Japanese guy gets involved into American gangs/mafia's businessThe story takes place in the US and involves drugs and mature content (like sex trade) 
It has a *slightly* more light-hearted version of Banana Fish's whole vibe. It revolves around con-artists, which is kinda similar to the gangs of Banana FIsh. "

Really well-written characters and conclusion.I think Light and Edamura have similar way of life. They hate evil but they already became evil from the beginning.Both crime society also similar elements. DN is more anti-heroes, GP is more dirty job.If you wanna watch DN without supernatural, GP is a special gift. One of best DN-like shows. 
In both of this anime you will be trick multiple times by the story and you can't predict what will happen next. All the characters are well written and enjoyable too. "
10408,4081,29,"Hotarubi no Morie e is like a longer Natsume Yuujinchou episode without Nyanko-sensei. 
Hotarubi no Mori e brings some of the best things about Natsume Yuujinchou in one neat 40 minute package. It is pretty much a Natsume Yuujinchou episode, sans Natsume and Nyanko-Sensei, plus the benefit of extra 20 minutes and a higher budget. That makes for a incredibly well done story with one of the sweetest (and saddest) romances I've seen in anime. This should be a must watch for Natsume fans. If you loved the movie but never watched Natsume... well, what on earth are you waiting for? 
Of course watching Hotarubi is like watching Natsume Yuujinchou.Not only they are from the same manga-ka, therefor sharing the same gorgeous art and a similar story telling as well the taste for the same genre: those are two titles who, if you liked one of them, you can't absolutly miss to wach the another as well!Both are sweet, delicate stories, with splendid colors and wonderful characters who'll bring you into those supernatural and fascinating worlds.Both give you the same calm feeling while watching them.Indeed, very highly recommended both ♥ 
Not only do Natsume Yuujinchou and Hotarubi no Mori e have the same original creator and similar setting, they are animated by the same studio, with the same director and even the composer is the same. Without any doubt there is more than one that these two would both be liked by the same people.The girl, Hotaru, in Hotarubi no More e and the boy, Takashi (mostly referred to by his family name Natsume), both see demon and spirits and they both befriend them. Both the film and the series play with a melancholic feeling and the relationship between humans and spirits. 
Hotarubi no Mori e is like the 2 episode version of Natsume Yuujinhou. Even the main characters Natsume and Jin are similiar. Also, musics, the athmosphere and animation styles are alike. I loved Hotarui no Mori e more than Natsume because there was a romantic story in it. I wish it could become longer. 
Not only do they share the same creator, their art style, the music, the setting and themes are similar as well. They are both touching and will probably leave you with tears. 
Both are about Youkai. Both have that bittersweet feeling to it.Hotarubi is about love while Natsume is about friendship with Youkai. If you enjoyed one of them, you will enjoy the other. 
Both anime are written by the same author, Yuki Midorikawa hence contains similar themes, mood, and settings.Both series has a mystical feeling which is smooth, slow paced, serene, and natural. The music in both series are also collected and calm. Both series also involves a main protagonist dealing with supernatural beings, specifically spirits.These two anime are both relaxing to watch that are considered rare gems. 
Gin gives an extremely similar feeling to Natsume. They are both extremely soothing and relaxing to watch, although one offers a more dramatic experience. 
Same voice actor for main male lead and similar plot about ghost spirits wandering around. The main story of Hotarubi is limited by the fact that it's movie, and so it doesn't have as much touching stories as Natusme, yet it is still very moving. Both emphasizes the importance of relationships, especially that of a close friend. 
Hoturabi no Mori e is almost exactly like an episode of Natsume Yuujinchou without natsume in it. About a Girl who meets a youkai it is also extremely touching. 
Similar Artwork, similar soundtrack, similar storyline. Both stories are about interaction between yōkai (supernatural monsters) and humans. Protagonists in both stories are complex and evolve in beautiful ways.   
They're both really calm and lovely shows. Hotarubi no Mori e is a movie, while Natsume Yuujinchou has four seasons. They both follow a human who sees spirits and occasionally hangs out with them. 
A dip in the simplicity and tranquility in a rural landscape through appearances in folklore,the charm, the beauty and magic of the forest and, the ""poetry"" of a wonderful Yuki Midorikawa. 
Both were originally written by the same author so they have very similar tones and have stories that revolve around human/yokai interactions. Both capture a peaceful and beautiful tone, however the movie Hotarubi no Mori e does have a heartbreaking sad part as opposed to Natsume Yuujinchou which tends to be bittersweet. 
It's like Natsume Yuujinchou, but shorter and with some romance mixed in.  Even if you don't like romance, watch it! 
Two animes that show us several points of view about the feelings of the Yokai, mainly the solitude, where although some hate humans, others wish to approach them. Where the protagonist is relates to the world of the Yokai, knowing more what they feel in their eternal loneliness. 
They both share the same director, and both share the same setting of the story  - a real world, but with spirits  living together with humans. Beautiful and touching stories, amazing animation and art, you will enjoy every minute of it.  
Both focus on youkai, the spiritual world, and the connection of people to it. Both take a softer and slower pace, and focus on character above action. 
Meeting and Farewell. Human instinct is appear as true color.Through the happy times and the sad times, after all you recalled important person.It is heartwarming or loneliness. Bittersweet memories will miss you. Do you have them in the first place? The answer should up to you.NY and Hotarubi no Mori e are written by same author. Of course, they are similar in every way.Takashi Natsume meets various creatures commencing with Madara. Himself always grow. Rise over time.Hotaru Takegawa meets Gin. Gin's look and existence are mixture of Natsume and Madara, and has mysterious secret.NY is TV show. Hotarubi no Mori e is short movie. Both feeling have kindness of heart.Both are rather wonderful works. These works charm you. And, NY is series. You'll like NY's sequels. read more 
Produced by the same studio, so if you enjoy the style of Natsume Yuujinchou then you'll love Hotarubi no Mori e. Both explore the relationship between people and spirituality, with Hotarubi no Mori e focusing more on romance. Can't recommend these works enough, 10/10 for both. 
Both works are from the author Yuki Midorikawa.Natsume Yuujinhou and Hotarubi no Mori e both tell stories about the various ways the line separating humans and youkai is crossed. Hotarubi no Mori e tries to bridge the gap between its main characters through a more interpersonal relationship while Natsume Yuujinchou has the main character try to reconnect with humans while struggling with his tight connections to the world of youkai for an intrapersonal mode of story telling.Atmosphere and setting has clear similarities between each accompanied by a similar OST as well. Both highly enjoyable watches for those looking for some Iyashikei-esque anime. 
The movie seems like a Natsume Yuujinchou movie with different characters and romance (the two anime have the same producer and sound director). To sum it up, the setting is the same: there are youkai and the story mostly takes place in a forest, both anime are calming and lovely. If you liked the latter aspects, you may most likely enjoy Natsume Yuujinchou a lot.  
Both explore the same themes like relationship between humans and Yokai 
Both are written by the same author. Hotarubi is basically an extra special episode from Natsume with different characters and no Nyanko-Sensei to kill the mood. 
Both shows deal with human interactions involving spirits. Hotaru although, is much shorter and focuses more on romance whereas Natsume focuses on relationship building  
Both has a similar feel to the setting and simplistic yet calming art with Japanese folklore elements. Both main characters have the ability to see youkai(spirits) and befriends them. The stories of both shows are moving and touching that will most likely bring tears to your eyes. 
- Same studio.- Shoujo.- Boys with supernatural powers.Honestly, these two anime just give you all the feels. 
big yokai energy. we stan. similar settings.also the main characters are very good 8)  "
10408,199,8,"Both are movies talking about a human that encounters a resident of spirits, in Spirited away it's a town and in Hotarubi no Mori e it's a forest. In both a human girl becomes a friend with one of the spirits and later falls in love with it. Both are lovely supernatural stories.  
Everyone already spotted the similarities. Both movies have spirits, girl and boy protagonists, but it's shorter and sadder. 
Both have supernatural elements and are about when a human interacts with spirits. They also have slightly similar themes of romance. 
Both stories revolve around a helpless, innocent little girl as a protagonist, who then is aided through the challenges she faces by a mysterious boy. As you watch through the film, you will see the relationship develop slowly between the two characters.As said in the previous posts, yes they also have that same supernatural related genre, and they both will also have that bittersweet ending as well.  
Very warm and sweet. A young girl is involved in a ""true love"" relationship with a non-human which ends somewhat prematurely and moves on in life. The portrayal of love is meant for a younger audience. There is somewhat a bittersweet feeling at the end, but with the emotional development of the main character, you cannot help but to feel happy for them. 
A girl encounters spirits, which then revolves into a story about the spirits and the girl either growing up or realizing things about herself. Both movies also include a huge amount of japanese mythology. 
Both films show a girl in her encounter with a magical character and her friendship that on the end becomes something more.The protagonists are very similar to each other and history has many similarities.Hotarubi No Mori e - - - Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi    Hotaru Takegawa - - - Chihiro Ogino                          Gin - - - Haku 
There are spirits. The girl wanders around the place and suddenly stumbles to the land of spirits and ghosts. Great storyline. A must see anime movie. "
10408,457,6,"Both focused on the person, who  can't live side by side with people because of circumstances. Both cause a calm and sadness 
Slow pace anime with magic creatures and epic story  
They both deal with spirits and have such a nostalgic sense to them. 
Well, they're not exactly the same thing but these two anime have a lot in common imo.Mushishi and Hotarubi no Mori e gives off a serene like feeling that is natural. Both series has supernatural themes with the main character being calm and collected. There is of course, strange rules in this world and applies it throughout both series. Both are wonderfully presented that has spiritual feeling to them which makes them relaxing to watch. 
-lonely white haired free-spirit-having fun outside in beautiful nature scenery-isolated villages with traditional air-returning over and over to visit-spirits and supernatural-accepting facts as facts 
The art of these two shows and the main male protagonist are similar. The beautiful landscapes of both Mushishi and Hotarubi are breathtaking and very similar. The art design for the characters is also quite similar. Not only do Ginko and Gin look alike, they also have a very similar purpose in their respective plots and act/think in similar ways. There is also a very similar kind of nostalgic tone to both shows. Additionally, both have meaning under the literal and will leave you thinking.  "
10408,9989,4,"Both of the anime are touching, also have a good story plot and will make you cry. These shows are more on supernatural and has a dramatic story and is worth watching and not time wasting. 
These two series are very much alike and have wonderfully told stories and characters that are bound to tug at your heartstrings. Both have protagonists that find themselves escaping reality over the summer through a supernatural occurrence and learning from the experience in the process. They also deal with many common themes such as life and death, impossible love and spirits. If you're into bittersweet endings and emotional stories that are certain to make you cry, both of these are simply a must-watch. 
Both protagonists meet a ghost/spirit that they'll get along with. Both wanting to spend time with their new friend. There bond strengthens as time goes by, both falling in love with each other. As their bond continues to strengthen, something heart-breaking occurs that will make the anime-watchers feel mentally or physically wounded with sadness.   
Sad story where the favourite characters die eventually and related to supernatural elements "
10408,12355,3,"Both deal with romance with the supernatural. Although Ookami is more on what happens after the romance, the two share the same ambiance. Both stories are lighthearted and simple, but deliver relatively strong emotions. 
A girl fall in love with a mysterious and lonely boy that is indeed not a human (werewolf/youkai).When she discovers his secret she still decides to stay by his side.Love wins, but with there will be consequences...Very good animations and sad-romance feels in both films. 
In both, the protagonist is in love (romantic and motherly) with a supernatural being. Also the overall atmospheres are alike. "
10408,523,2,"Both  are very similar slow-paced anime movies where a girl finds a friend Youkai (or forest spirit), although Hotarubi has sadder ending. 
Both movies take place in rural japanese environments and revolve around the main character's interactions with yokai/supernatural beings. They both also have that pleasant summertime feeling and have nice soundtracks to go along with nice visuals. Hotarubi no Mori e has more of a romantic storyline, while Totoro is more of a family story and adventure. "
10408,10162,2,"the truth is that I never saw a picture with a story so simple and so good at the same time, Usagi Drop is one of those anime that you get a good idea how to be a father; I when I first look was very surprised by the fact that so trivial as this story I alla been like thus a good anime, highly recommended, if you lost faith and think everything is loli by here and there, sees Usagi Drop and recover faith in humanity (light Japanese) 
Although displaying a different kind of relationship, Usagi Drop has very similar tropes. More realistic but enchanting in its own way, Usagi Drop is another heart warming story of the development of unconditional love. "
10408,23273,2,"Tears, tears, tears, and more tears.Both have ethereal and bittersweet romance,Although settings are a bit different, one is school and a TV show, thus more time to develop, while hotarubi is a movie, but trust me, a beautifully worded and animated one.Not for people who want happy ever afters, although tragedies can also be beautiful in their own ways. 
Both of them has ""loser"" kind of mc, and other stuffs (no spoiler intended) "
10408,32281,2,"Both are movies that describe the relationship between the boy and girl. They both have more bittersweet endings and have great storylines, and art. 
At first glimpse they may not be that similar, but if you take a further look in you can see that both shows follow some of the same patterns. Dont want to spoil it but please take a look if You're intrested in that romance/Drama thing. It will leave you in tears. "
10408,10379,2,"Not only do Natsume Yuujinchou and Hotarubi no Mori e have the same original creator and similar setting, they are animated by the same studio, with the same director and even the composer is the same. Without any doubt there is more than one that these two would both be liked by the same people.The girl, Hotaru, in Hotarubi no More e and the boy, Takashi (mostly referred to by his family name Natsume), both see demon and spirits and they both befriend them. Both the film and the series play with a melancholic feeling and the relationship between humans and spirits. 
Hotarubi no Mori e and Natsume Yuujinchou are written by Yuki Midorikawa and published by Brain's Base studio, so it's not surprising that both are very similar. Both Natsume and Hotarubi are stories about humans' interaction with youkai.Soft animation, haunting music, heart-wrenching story. To those of you who like bitter-sweet stories about humans and youkai. "
39535,37521,3,"Just gives off a very similar world building via superb visuals. The main character are also alike, although they fight for different reasons. Its hard to explain why both of thm give such a similar vibe as VS is not an Isekai but once you have watched either one of them and the first episode of the other you will know what I mean 
Fantasy world with great direction and slower pacing and very good writing. The MC isn't overpowered and you see constant growth both in power levels as well as a character. Side characters aren't 1 dimensional and have their own faults and issues.While not as realistic as Vinland Saga, Mushoku Tensei touches some very real themes. 
Both are anime that greatly expresses how one cope with trauma. One (Rudy) who is always bullied so he just chose to be alone and never wanting to leave their house, and one (Thorfinn) who witnessed the death of his father and is trying to get revenge. "
39535,1210,3,"Same show just its not an isekai. 
The protagonists are both NEETS and otakus dealing with the same issues. Both stories put great emphasis on overcoming your fears and becoming a better person

31043,9253,111,"When someone you hold dear is met the fate of losing their life, and you have the ability to go back in time to that moment to try and save them, do you have what it takes to do it? In Steins;Gate, science is used to create a time a machine, rewinding the clock and changing the course of fate and time by saving the one life (or two) In Erased, it is a slightly more chaotic as there is no science involved, only a lingering sense of guilt and the ability to rewind the clock before a drastic event occurs.These parallel lines were what drew me to Erased, and I wasn't disappointed. It did remind me of Steins;Gate with the aspect of time traveling to save a loved one. Changing the course of the present and time itself by making that one change and saving this one life, no matter the outcome. Hence, if you have enjoyed those elements in one of those anime shows, you will definitely enjoy watching the other. read more 
Boku dake ga Inai Machi like Steins Gate is about the main guy who has the ability to time-travel to the past to save someone dear to him. He ends up also having to save another girl from a tragic fate which he has romantic feelings for. Both anime start with a light mood and change drastically to a darker tone, dealing with the constant struggle of the hero endlessly trying to change the outcome of the future by changing the past. Also, If you watch Steins Gate the movie, you will find extra similarities with BDGIM. Really enjoyable animes with lot of mystery, great soundtrack and voice acting that will keep you interested from the beggining to the end. If you're a fan of Time-Travel both are a must watch and you'll definitely like one if you liked the other. read more 
Both of them are in a Dark theme with a wish to save someone in the past, To Fix a problem that happened in either present or past. 
I suppose its tiny bit of a spoiler, but both shows deal with time travel a fair bit. In particular, the main hero of both shows travels to the past for a chance to save the life of someone dear to him, while unraveling the mystery of what is happening around him. Both shows also contain elements of romance.The pacing of the shows is a bit different, as Boku Dake goes a bit faster, and the methods of time travel are different as well. S;G has more slice of lifey moments, and the main characters are fairly different. Theyre both outcasts of a sort, but S;G's protagonist could be seen as more immature.That said, both shows are very solid and if you like one, theres a decent chance youll like the other. read more 
I found that when I first started watching this anime, it instantly reminded me of Steins;Gate. The concept of going back in time and altering the past, and also with the incidents involving the protagonists I found were similar in a sense. Both have the male protagonist going back in time. This leads them to the future to see how what they have changed in the past has affected future events. However, I believe that Erased is more emotional and much shorter than Steins;Gate. 
Travels back in time to save dear ones and the plot makes you grip for more. 
Both involve time travel and heavily feature attempting to change the past for a better outcome. Erased focuses more on mystery and the changes Satoru makes as he relives his life while Steins;Gate centres more around the close relationships between Okabe and his lab assistants.   
Both of the stories revolve around time traveling concept. Both of the MCs are people who want to fix his past mistakes into creating a new timeline where the happy ending exists. 
-Both features the theme of time travel. -Both has the same plot of trying to prevent deaths by changing the future. -Both protagonist act as the leader of a group.-Both protagonist have special time-travelling ability.  
Both animes consist in saving important people to the main character, it is done in a way to make them understand better the mechanics of their ability to time travel.In each anime is presented a mystery about the murder, they unravel the mystery throughout the anime presenting new characters and linking the pieces of the puzzle together.They have extremely amazing history and direction, worth watching and recommending even for non-anime fans, the only bummer for non anime-watchers would be Okarin's personality (Steins;Gate main character) who is an outgoing character that yells and make jokes most commonly observed in japanese midia. 
Both shows involve similar time travel mystery.They are similar in many more ways that I cannot describe, yet I can assure you that you won't regret watching Steins;Gate if you liked Boku dake ga Inai Machi.Don't let the first 6-8 episodes of S;G let you down, it gets better, trust me. 
Dude goes back in time to save chick.Erased has a very visual novel-like atmosphere which is why people are reminded of Steins;Gate, an anime actually based on a VN. The colours used in both shows are quite drab and dark, with a similar atmosphere of desperation. Both shows have an adult cast.Aside from the main point re: time travel and chick-saving; the characters, their interactions, and the themes are all very different. 
- time travelling- save people to prevent serious matters- fight their biggest enemies- Good OP- smart MC- has their own unique artstyle 
-both main character goes back in time to try to change the story and only they are aware of it. 
Steins;Gate and Boku dake ga Inai Machi (Erased) both contain elements of time travel (Steins;Gate more than Erased). Both have really good characters and animation, both have a very interesting and engaging story and really get you invested in whats going on. I highly recommend this! 
This show is frail in comparison to the time travel in steins;gate. In stiens;gate the main character has a personality while retaining the basic urge to save his friends and loved ones. Yeah, you can do that with a personality. Also the time travel itself is the premise and the plot. In Erased time travel is just a tool the main character uses to attempt to capture the killer. In stiens;gate the killer is not obvious and it's very hard to tell when the plot twist will be. Meanwhile in Erased it was so obvious who was  the killer. In fact I didn't think the person could be the killer because it was too obvious. Anyway basically Steins;Gate>ERASED because Erased just wasn't written as cleverly.   read more 
- Very smart main character...- ...who has to get back in time to prevent someone's suffering/death- Clean visuals, catchy soundtrack- Amazing storytelling 
A Series about time Travel and Correcting the past much like Boku dake ga Inai Machi. Light Comedy and a thrilling emotional Story.  
Time travel & try to change destiny 
ON the surface these shows are very similar. There is time travel and the goal of saving people. One of these shows is consistent with its plot and characters (Steins Gate) and one is not (ERASED). One hints at things slowly and one clumsily hits you with blunt clues. I could make this list forever. But at the end of the day I recommend Steins Gate for fans of Erased and not the other way around. 
Steins;Gate and Boku dake ga Inai Machi revolve around the central idea of trying to save a life of someone dear to you by going back in time, only to find out that more problems and challenges have arisen. Steins;Gate explores more in depth into the time-travel theory and where the ability to time travel came from, thus the longer than usual 24 episodes while Boku dake ga Inai Machi takes are more simpler and easy-to-digest approach; just 12 episodes, on the time travel theme to take preventative measures to resolve a death and change the future. 
In both anime the main character has to go back in time to save someone he holds dear 
It's time travel, my dudes. Both are a part of ""good taste starter pack"", both are really good - and both share the main theme. 
Time travel...  
MC experiences time loops. There's an energetic, cute female with a distinct presence. They both start very excited and have a thrilling, creepy vibe to them. 
Both shows give the same feeling, the Main Character in both shows go back in time to prevent something horrible that will happen in the future 
Steins;Gate is also about time travel, the consequences of changing the past and dealing with it's given repercussions. Both show also deal with a lot of mystery that affect both the past and present.If you want more, Robotics;Notes is set in the same ""universe"" as Steins;Gate, albeit a very different type of anime yet 'affected' by the events of Steins;Gate.While we're at it, check out Chaos;Head as well.These three in chronological order are:Chaos;headSteins;GateRobotics;NotesTake it or leave it, your call.Either way, I've personally enjoyed these selections. 
Both anime shows have a complex plot line. Both ERASED and Steins;Gate involve time travelling to prevent something bad from happening. In my opinion, both animes are very similar and both shows are a must watch. 
Time travelers, butterfly effect, grandfather paradox...Steins; Gates is, above all, an incredible story about friendship. Boku take ga Inai Machi shares the framework, the main idea and goal: change the future from the past. 
Both consist of the protagonist having to time travel back to save someone he cares for. Only Steins;Gate  does it better in my opinion and actually has a solid explaination for the time travel mechanism. 
Both show are about time travel. 
Revival=Reading Steiner   ;) Both contain epic time travel. Brace yourselves. 
Both have a relation with time travel and both play with your mind. Moreover, you do not know what's going to happen in any of them. 
Both animes series are based on the ''Time travelling'' subject.    In both of the series the main character is trying to save someone dear to him.  There are major differences in the two animes , like Steins;Gate has a comedy side too and it's not as serious as BDGIM.  BDGIM is more emotional and dramatic.  Both of the series are worth watching , If you liked one of them you will like the other one for sure. 
Both include the theme of time travel, only difference being Boku dake ga Inai Machi is based on supernatural, whereas Steins;Gate is based on science. Boku dake ga Inai Machi is currently airing, showing another theme of having to go back in time to save someone. 
Eccentric MCTime travelAbove Standard AnimationOnly difference is Steins gate did everything else better but took longer to develop it plot.....hence why its above Boku dake on MAL. So if you watched boku dake, go watch this classic. 
Main character in both series are able to time-travel from the present to the past. The story centres itself with the theme of good versus evil with the main character having to make each and every small decision which can greatly affect the future depending on the actions done from the past. 
Same kind of story: time travel, destiny, a bit romantic, friends. 
Both have extremely well and tastefully written plots and characters, are thrilling and galvanizing. They conjure up intense feels and deal with time leaps. 
- Both revolve around the same idea of someone trying to change the future to prevent a murder- Both have protagonists that originally look bland but are actually great characters- Both have quirky looking, realistic characters- The biggest difference is that Boku Dake gets going much faster than Steins; Gate, but even this little detail has made some people think these series are very different 
Similar time travel concepts and psychological elements, and the main characters of both series have very similar experiences. Both series also have a fantastic story and good character development too. 
-Both shows have a time travel setting.-Both shows have lovable characters.-Both shows have the main character trying to save someone.Here's some advice: make sure to watch them back to back. I did that and it was amazing. 
-time travel-trying to save a person changing things on the past-Both have really good plot and drama. 
--In both animes MC go back in the past to change their fate..Though in Steins;Gate, the repeated failure can make you cry... :'(--In both animes... The MC go back in the time to save their beloved ones..--Both of them start off with a light start and then paces up....--And of course, How can I forget about THEM... The cliffhangers in both are just...OTHERWORDLY...(Keep an eye out when watching them, U might actually DIE!)Steins;Gates is a more Sci-Fi based anime...and makes use of time travel theories which actually exists...While Erased does not make any use real life theories and is a bit more Supernatural...But, No Doubt, Both are a MUST WATCH! read more 
Time Travel? Changing the Past? Both of these got it. Plus a whole deal with the psychological effect. Also, each MC has a smart person that figures out that something is up and tries to help. I don't want to spoil either of these series, so just watch it 
Traveling back and forth to the past, to prevent nasty things from happening to the protagonists. Both anime contain few good times too, however. 
Both shows focus on a male main protagonist that has a time-travel ability, that they use to save someone dear to them. 
Both animes are about time travel. Fujinuma Satoru and Okabe Rintarou time travel to past to save someone. Both endure failure and had to travel through time in several times to achieve their goal. This allows them to experience multiple timelines. 
Both series feature spirited protagonists, that might feel isolated from those around them, but are determined to the right thing and fix their mistakes - this may sound clichéd, but they both have enough quirks and enough charm to keep them interesting. From a genre perspective - both feature time travel and the idea of alternate worlds and realities, and the idea of preserving relationships across these boundaries. The artwork, particularly the backgrounds, is something definitely worth noting, as there as some stunning scenes throughout. Steins;Gate has more ""lighter"" moments, perhaps due to the added length, but both series definitely have plenty of suspenseful moments that'll have you moving onto the next episode as quickly as you can. And they both feature ambiguously-gendered boys. :P  read more 
Both of the anime's main character has the abillity to travel in time to save beloved people. Both are breath taking, If you're looking something similar then here it is! Loved it! 
Time travelers, butterfly effect, grandfather paradox...Steins; Gates is, above all, an incredible story about friendship. Boku take ga Inai Machi shares the framework, the main idea and goal: change the future from the past. Rintaro –Steins; Gate– and Satoru –Erased–, are in charge of it. The characters share more than it could seem.  
-Both anime tell about time time travel (especially back to the past).-Both main character try to save someone that important to them. 
they're both about time travel ""kind of"". and they're both really good... that was enough reason for me to watch it xD 
Both stories involve time travel used for the purposes of preventing a terrible eventBoth stories have a murder mystery and friendship as central plot pointsBoth have light romantic undertonesBoth stories have a deep emotional impact and are overall quite touchingIn general, there is a very similar thematic feel between these two animes, and if you like one then you will most likely enjoy the other. 
Both anime series involve a male protagonist going back in time to prevent a death. The difference is that one involves the use of technology to intentionally time travel and in the other, time travel is a super natural ability that the protagonist has little control over. I highly recommend both series and am confident you will enjoy both series' unique approach to stories involving time travel. 
Changing the future by fixing the mistakes done in the past plays a huge part in both series. In both anime, the main character tries to save someone important to them by traveling to the past. Both shows also keep you at the edge of your seat as you follow the protagonist on their mission and see the consequences of the actions and mistakes done by them. 
Both animes are related to time travel and the problems that accompany it.Characters are tested in difficult situations and will face difficult decisions to save their loved ones. 
is about the main guy who has the ability to time-travel to the past to save someone near him. 
This anime series is really similar of steins gate. Bouth are about time travel. 
Steins;Gate and Boku dake ga Inai Machi revolve around the concept of the butterfly effect, where one action causes a chain effect into the future. Both protagonists continually travel back in time to fix the main cause and to fix their futures from something both Okabe and Satoru don't want to have. Both are great fiction animes with Steins;Gate more on a technical, machine level and Boku dake ga Inai Machi with a simple ability. 
If you enjoyed the idea and usage of time travel and manipulation aspect of Erased, you will definitely love Steins;Gate as it expands upon it in almost every way. 
Both involve time-travel, emotions and mystery. Both has main characters in the age range 20-30 (Although, boku dake ga inai machi has the childhood past of the main character where he is a boy). Also, both has some romantic moments. 
Why? because they both have deep emotional story lines. Though both have a slow start if you get past the first few episodes, you will be entering a battlefield of emotions. I cried watching both, and so will you. Enough said! 
The way the protagonist has to go through time and solve his problems  
Another time-travel theory is present in this series, though compared to Steins;gate, Boku dake ga Inai Machi's time-travel occurs as a natural phenomenon instead of actually (and specifically) manipulating time.Both protagonists are on a quest to change the future by saving their loved ones, and their journey of fighting the evil ones (Criminal in ERASED, Organization in S;g) from being successful in their evil deeds. 
Boku dake ga Inai Machi is a very confusing anime and it isn't very easy to figure out whats going on,similar to Steins;Gate where your mind gets blown when the main character discovers something important. This isn't the only reason it is similar to Steins;Gate as the main character in Boku dake ga Inai Machi gets sent backwards in time,with his previous memories when a death or negative things happen around that he has to prevent. 
A powerful and pur love story! This affirmation is perfect for those anime.Like in ,,Stein;Gate"", ,,Boku dake inai machi has a unique way to tell a story by breaking time and help the protagonist to protect his lover and his friends.Those anime are REALLY similar but they stil have their original and exciting story involving time traveling and friendship. 
Both animes have time travels and they need to solve one problem in the past for get a better future. The main characters need to rescue a girl for being murdered, even if their life becomes more dangerous... 
-Both series are based on time travelling-While in 'Erased' its the main character's ability to do so, 'Steins;Gate' tries to put it in a scientific and logical way-In both anime, the main character time travels to save the ones close to them specifically females-Both seem very boring in the first parts of the anime but get excellent later-Erased focuses on the main character most of the time when but steins;gate puts the characters in groups and give an overall view of whats happening not just the main character's thoughts-Both have some great plot twists and one of them revolving around a character-Both have the main character having some psychological conflicts later in the seriesWhile I think Erased fans will love steins;gate, i can not say the opposite because some say steins;gate has that 'Masterpiece' element but everyone has different views so feel free to try read more 
Time travel can become interesting when coupled with great plots, if you look for it in another anime in this story line Steins; Gate was made for you. 
Both features the ability to time travel. They also bring up the subject of tragedy and sadness of attempting to go back in time to save loved ones. Steins;Gate does go on a more scientific route when it comes to time traveling while Erased tends to gear towards the subject of crime and mystery.  
Steins;Gate and Erased share a lot of similar traits:- both involve time travel (though it's explained more thoroughly in Steins;Gate)- MC travels back in time to save a loved one- both have a similar atmosphere/feel- intriguing plot and keeps you on edgeEven though Erased is more of a mystery anime than Steins;Gate, I found myself frequently drawing similarities between the two shows. If you liked the feel and premise of one anime, you will most likely enjoy the other 
ERASED had a potential that was unfortunately never utilized to its full potential, with its conclusion failing to wrap up things as satisfyingly as it should have been. This may have been recommended time and time again, but Steins;Gate is the epitome of time-travel anime, after all, with its science fiction elements fully explored within the course of its whole run and a deeper and darker feeling...that ERASED should've had, mind you, if it was only ever expanded upon aside from being a mere plot device. 
Both anime focus on the male protags travelling through time to save the girls most important to them. However, SG focuses more on the science aspect of the story, while Erased's focus is more on solving a mystery, as well as the protag's feelings about the ""new"" set of people around him.In my opinion, SG is far better because it does not have one tenth the number of plot holes that Erased does, but then again, others will have a different opinion. 
In both cases the protagonist returns to the past, trying to stop something from happening in the future, while struggling to cope with the fact that he is the only one that knows of this future event. Both protagonists are also seemingly helpless when it comes to action, so their struggle is completely intellectual. 
Both involve going back into time to change the future and avoid a terrible fate for a particular character. 
Both of the shows are based on the chaos theory called ""The Butterfly Effect"" which is quite interesting to watch - because I, myself am a big fan of the theory.Both of them have likable characters!Both of them are serious but still have humor in them, even though ""Boku dake ga Inai Machi"" is more serious and much shorter than the epic ""Steins; Gate"" 
Both series involve going back through time. I don't want to reveal too much so I'll leave it like this. Both are great anime for sure. :) 
Both got time travel fantasy on it.Both got alot of drama and plot twists within it. Steins Gate talking about the consicuinces of changing the past. While boku dake ga inai machi changing the past for better future. 
The main character has Time travel manipulation powers which is able to assist him in saving the ones he cares about. 
The MC went back in time to save a girl. Romance is pretty good. Entertaining to watch. Same dark vibe, in my opinion. 
These are both great shows. Both main characters go through similar struggles and repeatedly re-do events for a different outcome. The setting albeit differ from one another still make for very similar shows. Both are great thrillers. I love them both. 
They both focus on a basic concept of time travel(of sorts) and focus on saving a loved one by altering past actions.High on suspense and moments that could give you goosebumps no matter how many times you watch them...Great Stories...Highly recommended. 
Both revolve around time travel to erase past mistakes and fight for a better future. They have really good characters (with similar main characters) and animation, both have a very interesting and engaging story and you really get invested in whats going on. 
Both impossible love storyBoth male lead doing time travelBoth this is best saddnest anime ever 
Both shows feature lovable MC's and heartwarming characters. Both shows also deal with Time travel in similar but unique ways. 
-TIME TRAVEL/THRILLER best combo-GOOD OP-Well written plot (especially S;G)-SMART MC (yes okabe 200IQ confirm)-Both characters are a leader of their group of friend-Both characters got a special time related power-Both characters trying to save their partner 
Fairly dark and psychological time travel shows with interesting art styles and presentation, though with stories that go on different directions. 
Time travel anime about preventing certain events from occurring. 
In both animes the main character travels trough time to save someone they care about. 
Same Plot, but ERASED is a simplified version 
The concept of time travel is very similar and if you watched one of them you'll probably like the other. 
Erased draws the easy comparison to Steins;Gate in that they're both time travel anime. Running the connection a little deeper, Erased is also home to its own set of likable characters and time travel consequences. 
-Tells the story of the male main character who saves the person that he loves-Using time travel concept (Time loop)-bring us about emotional and depressional psychotics complex 
Similar kinda story but you'll get much more different between 'em. Boku Dake ga Inai Matchi has a great story with the MC.s supernatural ability to go to the past and the desire to save his classmate from a kidnapper.I am sure you'll enjoy it. 😊😊      
Both animes have interesting time travel tramas and both characters travel through time to save their dear friends! If you liked Steins;Gate you might like Erased as well. 
Both about time travel and saving someone 
Same ""return to past mechanics"" and very intricate and interesting plot. Just like Steins; Gate, is very fond of the characters. 
IF you like time travelling related animes you will like both of these animes.They are both about time travelling and changing the past. 
both are about time travelling and will surely make you loose your breathe 
Both MCs try to make changes the past occurrences in order to save the girl's life.They both a have an opportunities of traveling to the past, even though in different ways. 
-Both anime revolve around time travel-similar if not same concepts -the main characters spend the entirety(mostly)saving others but in an completely different manner-Awesome ops 
If you like such a masterpiece as steins gate, then you may also like Boku dake ga inai machi, in both anime titles the main character moves in time, into the past in order to change the future, to prevent someone's death or change the future in a good way ... In steins gate, science is used, a time machine, in Boku dake ga inai machi there is no science, the main character has the ability to travel to the past if some bad event occurs. I advise you to watch Boku dake ga inai machi, good anime, that's for sure, you'll love it! I'm sure :) read more 
If you loved the time travel aspect OR the characters of Steins;Gate, Erased should be your next stop. A short anime that features both time travel and lovable characters, it is almost able to match the intensity and depth of Steins;Gate even as it spends most of the story focused on elementary school children. 
Both are great animes. In ERASED there is no scientific logic for the revival but the theme is somewhat similar to that of steins gate. However, steins gate will still be the best. 
They are similar due to the time travelling mechanic both animes possess.But Boku dake ga Inai Machi uses the time travelling mechanic in a kind of different way than Steins;Gate.If you like Steins;Gate's plot I can almost guarantee, that you will love the story of Erased. 
1) Both of them involved a travel back-and-forth between the past and future and the effort to change it2) Both of the characters are a man who want to change certain event to change the whole sequence of the future3) Both of the series involves an intense story and real-life interraction just like your typical daily activities 
-Thriller Anime with Heavy Emotional Beats- Great soundtrack- intriguing mystery elements 
These two go well together because they deal with time travel and the plot twists are as shocking. The protagonists are pretty similar in the way they act which gives them the same appeal. 
Steins;gate is infinitely times better so if you liked Erased this will be amazing. Both revolve around time travel, yet only truly captures the essence of it.  
Similar to Steins;Gate, Erased asks the question ""If you could go back in time to prevent a tragedy of a loved one, would you?"" While Erased ignores science for a more supernatural explanation of time travel, it follows the same principle. Distinctly, Erased touches on the nostalgia of childhood, while teasing the audience with its engaging murder mystery throughout the series "
31043,31240,44,"Imagine a world where fate demands to be corrected and it is willing to go through an endless binding cycle to achieve that purpose. The curse of time travel being portrayed at its best where the ones involved either witness gruesome deaths or experience it themselves. Happy endings are hard to come by but the future remains uncertain, it is up to the individual to decide the closure they deserve.‘Boku dake ga Inai Machi’ showcases a game of cat and mouse that has seen it being dragged on for over 10 years in which all the tragedies that unfolded before us are planned by one single entity. The rich storyline that is full of substance accompanied by dark striking character expressions will undeniably leave your heart pumping while trying to anticipate the outcome of one’s action. ‘Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu’ convene its story through multiple layers of secluded mystery where it is not known how each event are related. Unlike ‘Boku dake ga Inai Machi’, this mystery-base story plays right into the show’s strength due to the final villain not being revealed blatantly while their true purpose remains an enigma. Commendation should also be given to the series with the way it prioritises its vision, the romance/harem is certainly noticeable but never overwhelm the true objective which is the storyline. Audience would certainly appreciate the character interactions and comedy which sets a lighter tone away from the frightening events that has all but left us bewitched. read more 
Both have the time jump where the main actor is able to change bad history in his favor. Both are realy heart touching.Both try to befriend pretty girlsBoth try to save all of their friendsBoth have the agonny  if the fate time can be changedDiference in them is that Zero takes a normal guy to alternate game like worldThe art is nicerThe gore is worse yet not so autentic, the deads are more epic yet kinda unreal but well  thats how i see it.In year this are the best new animes i seen, that are psychological, apealing a u dont want to be in skinn of the main charakter, yet on other hand u want it. read more 
Re:Zero have the same thing with revival even if is only if he is dying and not to save others too like in BokuMachi. 
While BokuMachi is set in our modern world and Re:Zero is in a fantasy world, both anime have the basic premise where the protagonist has the ability to reset their experience to a certain point in order to avoid a dead end. Further similarities lie in the fact that both characters have very little control on this phenomenon. Note that the series focus on using this ability to avoid bad end, rather than getting the bottom of this mysterious phenomenon. 
the deep story of change the past is here in a bigger way for only 12 episodes. Here we have the one, who only can time-skipping and we have the problem, wich have to distroy. But in Boku dake ga inai machi.. the protagonist has only one chance to help the person and change the past. Police/Detective/psychological/Mystery... here we can't find the genre 'comedy' 
A time loop going back in time to fix something or save someone 
Similar themes. The main character goes through the same timeline many times trying to save people and to set things right. Both of these shows have amazing cliffhangers and great art, and you'll watch one episode after another.The only difference would be that Re: Zero is set in a fantasy world with different races, magic and creatures, while Boku dake ga Inai Machi (Erased) is set in a world similar to the real one we live in. If you enjoy one, you'll likely enjoy the other, though. 
Time travel when a problem arises (in the case of Re;zero, it is due to death)! Very good at creating suspense towards the end of each episode. 
main character resets the progress made (kinda like travelling back in time) by dying, tyring to save the people dear to him. 
They are similar in the sense that the MC are able to change the history, It is also both breathtaking to know what will happen on the next episode. Consider it a different perspective everytime you watch. 
- Both are very dark Thriller shows...- Both has time-loop themes [ no, Re:Zero isn't time travel anime, look at Anime Man's video about this show ]- Both has male MC's who tries to save the people they care about.... [ Loooove xD ]- Both are pretty new/modern animes who reached TOP 100 in notime, they're pretty popular too..[ haters included :) ]- Ok, I won't lie that both shows has great OP's/OST's which will make you're ears orgasm by themselves [ ok, this is dumb but whatever ]- In both you somehow start to feel for MC's for what they went, kinda self-insert animes...- Both at very end of each and evey episode leaves you at big cliffhanger's...[ I think that's good ]- By the way, if you like graphical violence - this is for you, just don't expect 90's level of gore/curses and other non-moe stuff..> Re:Zero has 'fantasy' aspects like - all rpg creatures, magic and other stuff...while Boku dake.. is more 'real life' - modern day life without any magic/superpowers/monsters...> And Re:Zero has waifu's [ Ogre sisters are the best - so gtfo if you don't like it D ] read more 
Going back in time after a life threatening situation with a destiny and fate you are so called put in to save a life? This is the foundation of the plot concept that both Boku dake ga Inai Machi and Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu contain.   
Same ConceptCant tell too much otherwise it would ruin it but if if you liked Ereased This one should be your next target (Except it has EPIC FIGHTS) 
both tell about the return of the time that has passed and equally fight for what they want, protect and save those who are important to them 
Both main characters can travel in time and they do it because they want to save a person that they love 
Both anime have a few things in common. Dealing with time travel and a heroine going back in time to help someone special.The both have received good reviews and plenty of reason to watch. 
○ The protagonists have a similar power○ The protagonists aren't completely useless!○ Heavily focused on psychological/emotional elements○ Great shows of 2016! 
The protagonists in these series strive to make a good deed or to make a difference in the world.They both travel back in time if anything bad would have happened. They are taking a journey towards that difference that they would make.  
-Both involve a protagonist repeating the same 'scene' over and over again-In that sense, both are about leaping timelines-Some characters are similar (ex. Subaru leaping back to save Rem, Satoru leaping back to save Hinazuki) 
- Both have time travel themes.- Both protagonists want to use it to save people. - Both allow graphic violence. 
Anime almost have the same idea of traveling through time in order to save the lives of their friends who had died before the travel process through time. 
If you liked the mind-blown feeling when Satoru use time-travel to save the people he cared about, then you must watch Subaru using his Return by Death power in Re:Zero. Boku dake ga Inai Machi sets in the real world while Re:Zero showcase a young teenager got sent into a fantasy world mysteriously. Don't get fooled by the cliché of an MC getting involved in a fantasy because Re:Zero will offer lots of twists and turns when you least expect it. 
Ok, this may sound stupid but the only persuasive argument as to why I recommend this to Re: Zero was the concept of time loop that almost has the same concept as to Tom Cruise's ""At the edge of Tomorrow."" 
-Both have slimier stories -Both have great main character that could travel in time.. (for Re:zero it's dying.. but for boku it's screaming out loud i guess)But i prefer Re zero as the best of time travel anime's of all Time :"")   
Similar idea and great main characters in both. 
Both series involve the protagonist using time travel to solve their problems. Boku Dake ga inai Machi deals with heavier issues and more realistic issues (like bullying and child abuse) while Re:Zero is set in a fantasy and therefore the problems are more set in fantasy although still applicable to real life (discrimination). Both series are for anime fans that enjoy darker anime. 
These two stories revolve around the idea of traveling back in time and fixing what has happened in a previous life and the concept of the butterfly effect. With both anime protagonists trying to fix things right, many of their actions may have a wrong twist to them. They are both interesting to watch, either in the fantasy lands of Re: Zero or the twisted year of 1988 in Boku dake ga Inai Machi. 
Re:Zero is my favorite this spring 2016 and boku dake ga inai machi of winter 2016.. it really feels like im rewatching boku dake ga inai machi while watching Re:Zero but its only difference is the genres of these two.. Re:Zero is a dark anime while boku dake ga inai machi is not but Re:zero is still worth watching..  
Both involve time travel and the main character trying to go back and prevent the death of other main characcters.Just do it its only 13 eps boi 
Not only do these stories share a similar premise of going back in time to same your friends, but they also share many similar features as well, such as irredeemably evil villains. Also, both had a romance subplot that managed to piss off every single one of it's fans by deliberately not shipping everybody's OTP and sinking them faster than a discount refugee ship from Syria. If you can tolerate one, you can definitely tolerate the other! 
Protagonists are trying to save the whole of their friends and time travels  
Both revolve around time travel to erase past mistakes and fight for a better future. They have really good characters (with similar main characters) and animation, both have a very interesting and engaging story and you really get invested in whats going on. 
Both male lead is patheticBoth have revival powerBoth have two main heroine 
movies like final destination, rezero and this anime have one thing in common. the mc has to prevent tragedy based on his acquired knowledge of future events. if thats what youre looking for then rezero is the way to go 
THEIR CONCEPTS ARE QUITE SIMILAR BUT THE SERIES IS VERY DIFFERENT 
Although the universe of these two works has a completely different setting, they share interesting similarities.- Both deal with the supernatural element of returning in time in order to save people, although in Erased, Revival is activated by the death of people around, and not by the death of the protagonist.- In addition, in both works, the protagonists make use of the information gathered before the return in time and solve mysteries that allow them to follow the timeline forward.- Both Re: Zero and Boku Dake ga Inai Machi present a theme involving attitudes such as self-condemnation, suffering and explore the psychological of the protagonist resulting from his losses. This also makes the two characters extremely human.- Both protagonists, initially, show a greater difficulty in creating bonds with other people, although Erased focuses more on that element, in my opinion.- Both the protagonists' narratives, Satoru and Subaru, involve building and inspiring a heroic figure for those around them. In Erased, Satoru is inspired by Wonder Guy, while in Re: Zero, Subaru is based on what he means to Rem.- In both works, the perspective of a female character influences the main character's way of thinking. In Boku Dake ga Inai Machi, Airi Katagiri is talked about, while in Re: Zero, that role belongs to Rem (and Emilia, of course).- Both animes present heavy situations and cold reality, portraying very pertinent questions. This element is more seen in Erased, however, with the reality of mistreatment, bullying and the impacts of the lack of a paternal / maternal reference. read more 
Both shows have main characters go back in time to prevent certain events from happening in the future. 
Both animes are good and have the same time travel premise to save someone and are popular psychological animes. 
Fighting fate with time. Erased and Re:Zero are both excellent stories of fighting a determined fate via time travel.Both anime give a standard MC who ends up into an unexpected world. Erased has Satoru transport into 1988, with Re:Zero transferring Subaru to the foreign land called Lugnica. In these movements, both Satoru and Subaru use their gained time travel powers to change the worlds of before in hopes of keeping loved ones safe.With Erased being a murder mystery, Re:Zero is much more dramatic. All in all, both are great supernatural psychological anime with slow romance to spare.   
Mechanics of the return to the past present in both works, the many psychological attacks on the protagonist are very successful and exciting 
Both Invole a form of timetravel. while RE:Zero is a lot more dramatic and at times hard to watch (in a good way) Erased is a good story told to the end in one compact season. 
Erased and Re: Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu are the two anime whose main characters have the power of time travel and can change them, the two main characters in this anime also use the power of time travel to save the main heroine. Re: Zero has more action and dramatic scenes, while Erased has tense scenes and the main character has to think smarter to do something.  
Like Re:Zero, this is a series about someone who can reverse time to stop a tragedy before it happens. Satoru Fujinuma gets sent back to a few minutes before the tragic event, and has saved a number of people with his uncanny ability to be in the right place at the right time. 
In Re:Zero MC recruited  into different World and in Boku dake ga Inai Machi MC went to his primary student life.1.Both struggled hard to complete their mission.2.One has cute wifus and other has cute  story.3.So now what watch both animes "
31043,37779,21,"Surprised there aren't more people drawing connections between these two... Similar in terms of genre and tone (psychological suspense/thriller), in addition to overall visual style (initially thought they might have been the same studio). In terms of plot, both follow the travails of powerful children facing dark/sinister, still-more-powerful antagonists, which leads to the cat-and-mouse pacing of each episode. Prime differences would be in setting (""Boku dake...""/""Erased"" is more realistically grounded, despite the key plot device motivating the central arc of the story, vs. the futuristic sci-fi/fantasy world of ""Yakusoku...""/""Promised Neverland""), and protagonist focus (""Boku dake...""/""Erased"" largely centers on the perspective of one MC, vs. ""Yakusoku...""/""Promised Neverland"" following the three central kids with more of an ensemble approach at points). Beyond those points, they're both quality, anime-of-the-season type series! read more 
Young protagonist, same sort of seinen psychological drama. 
The Promised Neverland and Erased both focus on a group of young people faced with a very hard adult task. They're both thrillers that keep you on the edge of your seat. 
Both shows feature a fairly mature plot with kids taking on impossible odds. This may sound like most shonen however the unique thing about both shows is that there isn't much fighting at all. If you like watching shows were the young protagonist tries to outwit a much older antagonist and if you like stories with darker themes then these shows are for you.  
Both animes have a similarity in the circumstances of the main group of characters. They are pre-teen children working together to outwit adults and possibly save the lives of other fellow classmates/dormmates. Also, the Atmosphere surrounding the characters in both animes are eerie and they both have supernatural elements to a certain extent. 
Similar vibe of smart kids trying to solve issues bigger than themselves in a dark setting. Psychological aspect, and characters are similar.  
If you like rooting for a group of incredibly clever kids, trying to uncover a mystery in a world that may be grander than first expected, you're gonna love this one. Both shows will have you on the edge of your seat; whether you decide to watch it all in one go, or take it one episode at a time. Superb writing, plot twists, and a strong cast of protagonists & antagonists make for two really great anime that I'd definitely recommend watching! 
Both these show have kids as main characters, who are capable of extraordinary reasonings and are fighting against adult villains. 
These two anime are both similar in a number of ways. Firstly, they both have a dark overarching tone with aspects of psychological horror/thriller and threatening human antagonists. They also both have child protagonists with adults being the antagonists, although Boku dake ga Inai Machi focuses on one main protagonist whilst Yakusoku no Neverland has three protagonists with a fairly equal share of screen time. The art style is similar in both.One significant difference lies in the settings of these two stories; Boku...Machi is set in the real world despite having one fantastical element (being Satoru's 'revival' power), whilst Yakusoku no Neverland is set in an entirely fictional world with prominent fantastical elements, although these are not the main focus and do not have a large amount of screentime.Basically, if you enjoyed the tense drama of Boku...Machi then you'll most likely enjoy Yakusoku no Neverland. read more 
- The protagonists are all young (in fact are the same age).- Both show abuse (more so in Erased though).- Both have intense scenes where the main characters hit a block.- The protagonists are trying to save lives. 
both are mystery & psychological, similar enjoyment. 
Both are thrillers including kid characters. Both have questionably intelligent characters. Both have good production values and their own visual directing style. I personally really preferred TPN to Erased. 
The children's fight. The Promised Neverland and Erased follow children fighting to keep others around them alive.In TPN, Emma, Ray and Norman fall into the situation wherein constant mental fights are at play against the those around them who are controlled by the Demons. With Erased, Satoru is sent back to 1988 as a child, in his fight against fate, and the serial killer who had killed Kayo, one of his classmates.Using psychological elements as the main theme, TPN shows the mental games children must play to stay alive. Along with Erased, though more mystery-solving.    
The psychological terror shown in both shows, plus the fact that both have children remakably brave with outstanding minds is what makes this two series a must-watch. Both storys have a very strong impact on you. The Promised Neverland does not provide super natural powers, but instead, extremly smart kids. 
Both present an atmosphere of suspance and a thriller development. Both are short and self-contained. Two small masterpieces. 
Both are psychological thrillers in which kids are attempting to outsmart adults to save their lives. 
Both shows star children having to solve mysteries with unique supernatural ideas added in. If you enjoyed the feeling of suspense that one of these shows offered you will find something to appreciate in the other. 
Both is mystery anime and both is good. 
Both the shows came from the same genre i.e. psychological thriller. If you liked the promised Neverland then there is more likely a surity that you are going to like erased. Both the shows keep people's on the edge of their seat and indulge in people's guessing what's going to happen next. 
Both are thrilling and have heavy pressure Both anime op are nice to hearboth anime has some plot twistboth anime is to prevent killing 
Both have animes have a similar way of storytelling and as a sucker for psychology animes with good plots you'll definitely like them! "
31043,9989,15,"Both of them have a main character who regrets a certain thing that happened in their childhood involving a girl, and they both try to ""fix"" it. Both of them are dramatic, thrilling, psychological and emotional. AnoHana and Erased have brilliant directing and production, they have the same director, stunning visuals, detailed backgrounds and some hidden stuff in their op and ed, and they're both made by A-1 pictures. 
Both of them involve revolving around the childhood of the MC, and a little girl/childhood friend. Both are quite emotional and touching~Both have phenomenal soundtracks and great visuals, along with superb narration and directing. Both have really good OPs and EDs as well. 
Both of these anime involve childhood friendships, death in a small group of young kids, and supernatural elements such as time travel or a ghost. both are extremely emotional and touching. 
>Both involve little kids and their relationship>Both are really dramatic 
- Death. Dealing with the deaths. Aftermaths of deaths.- A group of childhood friends. In Erased, the friends are mostly seen in in their childhood-form whereas in AnoHana it switched between childhood memories and the current highschoolers.- Male MC who is more or less a loner at the start solving the puzzles/finding closure.- Emotionally rich works with lots of drama. 
Honestly I feel the need to reccomend this and Steins;Gate together. If There were an anime with the story of Steins;Gate, and the characters of Anohana, then ERASED is it. If you like ERASED, you will love these two. 
Both are series that explore the past and the results of a traumatic childhood event. Animation is very similar and while watching the series it often reminded me of Ano Hana. Characters in Boku Dake ga Inai Machi are much more fleshed out in my opinion.  
The story, the characters and even the opening of Ano Hana is similar to Boku Dake. Besides they are both very engaging and dramatized. 
+ Both are series that explore the past and the results of a traumatic childhood+ Character designs is somewhat similar...(eyes)+ Both of these anime are emotional...really...+ Both have amazing visuals/ost's...+ Both are made by A-1 Pictures / both has similar genres as well...- (just Jintan from AnoHana is so damn annoying, unlike Satoru) 
The main protagonist have a supernatural based issue helping them with a situation involving a childhood friend who was killed. Boku Dake is more of a thriller/mystery show while AnoHana is more of a emotional piece. Both however are well directed and have beautiful animation. Definitely would recommend both to watch! 
In both series an introverted Main Character is forced to confront major events from his childhood in order to make a better future for himself. The main difference is that in Ano Hana, Jinta must overcome his grief at losing a dear friend in Menma in order to rebuild his own life, whereas Satoru goes directly back in time to stop the death of a girl in his class named Kayo Hinazuki. 
Both have great drama story and plot. These anime stories revolve around someone that isn't actually part of their time and is living in another time, either future or past. I highly recommend AnoHana to those who liked ERASED and vice versa because of their great story, drama and especially their tear-jerking plot.  
Both theses animes will hit you the feels if you want that then I suggest a watch. 
-I got the same feeling when watching both of these shows.-Both are about a young girl that died in the past. 
Its really similar pace wise yet it is more on the thriller side of things.  "
31043,1535,12,"Both are anime about how to find the criminal among usual people and to prove his guilt. Also, both have supernatural moments, though Boku is a smarter one. 
Death Note and Boku dake ga Inai Machi both deal with the matter of death and feature detective-style mystery. In particular, they share the same dark feel in both animation style and plot, though Death Note is undoubtedly even darker. If you liked that side of ERASED, then you will like Death Note as much, if not more :)  
A highly strategic killer who seems too skilled to ever get caught is confronted by possibly the only person ever capable of catching them. One of them also has a supernatural ability which may give them an edge over the other.Both anime have a pretty dark tone to them and keep you at the edge of your seat wondering what's going to happen next. They also give you the feel of a constant battle going on between the hero and the killer where even the slightest mistake could have drastic consequences. Although Erased doesn't show the conflict directly from the killer's perspective, you can tell how the actions of the main character force the killer to alter his plans behind the scenes. read more 
Both of them have a really cathing story with supernatural things and murderer in them. 
They're both physcological and they're a mix of both realistic and mythical worlds; for example, Shinigamis aren't proven to exist and neither is a Death Note but yet it is set in a normal, everyday world. This is similar to how Erased is set in a normal world with a typical urban atmosphere but Fujinuma's revival ability gives it a mythical twist.  
Similar subject matter (murder mystery with a supernatural element) handled in a fresh, intelligent way. Both shows give a chance for the viewer to try and work out the mystery alongside the characters rather than simply witholding information until a critical reveal.  
Both are dark psychological murder thrillers that will leave you wanting to binge on each episode with every plot twist that comes.  Both MC's are very intelligent and watching their plans come to fruition is putting a puzzle together piece by piece.  Both are full of internal dialogue from the MC to help you become fully immersed in their stories and motivations.  For being full of plot twists, both shows have good rewatchability as you pick up little things you may have missed during your previous watch through.  Both also have very good english dubs, if you prefer watching it that way. read more 
if you like Boku dake ga Inai Mach you definitely like death note. It will give you thrills. You will have so much of intense and you will be so much of curious after every episode.  It's worth to watch it. 
Both shows have a powerful yet short and flowing story. That being said they both also have a kind of disappointing ending, but it's whatever.  
Hunt for the serial killer. Though Death Note and Erased both have differing stories, they both follow people who hunt for a particular serial killer in order to stop them from their rampages.Both anime are dark mystery anime with Death Note containing tons of mind games and Erased being lighter and condensed in comparison to Death Note. 
They are both about a detective trying to find the murderer, and in both animes there's a really good suspense and often the detective or the murderer already know the next steps that the other is going to take/choose. 
Both are Mystery, trying to find a suspect in a cat-and-mouse type chase, with Erased being more on the Supernatural side, but still a great series to watch nonetheless. "

Both shows have a similar atmosphere and are intriguing. They are made by the same studio and feature a similar artstyle. Both shows are rather dramatic and involve mature themes/issues.

31043,28851,5,"These two are very similar in the way that the mc wants to ""save"" or ""help"" a female character, in their childhood years. Koe no Katachi is more about regret and the mc is trying to make up for it, while Erased is just trying to prevent something from happening. There are no ""fantasy"" elements to Koe No Katachi however. Both are kind of about human bonds. KNK has a more emotional growth to it, while Erased it's just Satoru trying to fix his problem, but not necessarily becoming super close to the girl (they have moments but i wouldn't say theyre close.) Both are good anime!! KNK is slightly better because of that last part I mentioned. read more 
Well, those two shows doesn't look the same for the scenario but have some similar points.1- Those two shows speak about child harassment. The main character will try to save or to redeem himself from the other main character, the girl.2- The atmosphere is oftenly sad but got some funny moments. In those two shows, the main character got a good friend who'll be helpfull (Nagatsuka and Kenya).3- Minor characters look pretty similar, for exemple: the mother is there without her husband and try to help her son. 
Both shows center around the male and female leads early and later lives, with an ominous past relationship and touches on dark topics. 
The main characters focus on helping another person and trying to make up for the past. Dark subjects that many people are afraid to talk about are explored but it's what made the stories as good as they are. How important the actions of just one person can be.  
Fixing past mistakes. A Silent Voice and Erased are both stories in which the MCs fix past mistakes with the aspiration of a better relationship between the MCs.A Silent Voice gives MC Shouya a hard life present time in consequence of his actions regarding bullying Shouko, despite this he aims to fix these mistakes along with Shouko in order to better their relationship. Erased is quite literal in this matter in that Satoru, who travel back to 1988, tries to prevent classmate Kayo's death by fixing mistakes he made at the time.A Silent Voice offers a high-quality animated dramatic, romantic story. With Erased being on the flip side, offering a dark murder mystery. read more "

31043,7785,4,"Both anime have to do with time travel and changing the past. tatami galaxy is more comedic and erased is more serious. Both are very enjoyable. 
- Unusual artstyles (Tatami Galaxy is more extreme with regards to that, where as Erased is just a little unconventional when it comes to face designs.)- A dense-feeling plot and well developed world by virtue of the repeated timelines- Repeating storylines (Time skips and different 'routes', a very VN like approach. The time skip is much larger in Erased though.)- Similar themes of fate/destiny and romance- Adult protagonist- Similar OST/music styleTatami Galaxy is more wry humour and very fast dialogue, whereas Erased is more heavy drama and pensive silences.  
Similar looking protagonist....trying to think about the past and changing it. 
Erased and Tatami Galaxy both have a similar protagonist and have a story focused around changing the past. The two show's opening are made by Asian Kung-Fu Generation. Also they both have an amazing character design and voice acting.  "

31043,1210,2,"They're similar in how both of the main characters are isolated from most people and often have inner narrations throughout the story. They both have events in their past that are often brought up and are relevant to the plot. They share psychological and seinen genres, which makes them feel similar as well. Not to mention, both series deal with very dark topics, like suicide (NHK) and kidnapping (ERASED). 
NHK ni Youkoso! and Boku dake ga Inai Machi are both, in my opinion, moving psychological thrillers. Both shows share deep, underlying thematic content that unifies the plot in a meticulous yet exceptional way. Additionally, both shows share an extremely dark tone due to plot elements such as murder (ERASED) and suicide (NHK) present. As for the main male lead in both shows, both characters have to face their past head-on in order to move forward in life. They are also portrayed rather realistically (i.e. not an anime archetype) and can be relatable to a niche of the general population. If any of these appeal to you, I would recommend checking out the other series when you get a chance. read more "

Very similar as its also an extensive story with similar retro grafic styles 
Both shows are high caliber Anime space operas. I'm surprised no one has made this rec yet  
Both are the greatest space operas around. Though galactic heroes is a political thriller as well. 
Both are amazing space opera and I enjoy listening to the Yamato opening every time. 
The two series are space military science fiction animes.Both series show a very active war between the two empires, but while Legend focuses more on an ongoing war between two superpowers of comparable power, in Yamato one of them is on the verge of defeat and the anime covers an expedition to a far world that can win the war if they succeed.The strategy is equally important in both, but in Legend they can last several episodes or arcs and have effects some time later, while in Yamato it is generally limited to solving the typical situations of each episode.Both have that classic aesthetic of old spaceships, it contrasts a lot with the futurism that is the fashion now. Although this style has obviously been renewed in Yamato, it still retains the classic charm. It also applies to the design of the Yamato characters, they still have the original visual style but have been adapted to modern times very satisfactorily. Ironically, they are now one of my favorite modern anime designs.Both series have a strong policy component, but Legend has the same importance as military strategy. In Yamato it is simply limited to the fact that because the rival empire is a monarchy with high nobility, all those who lead the enemy combat forces against the Yamato have some importance in their empire. But that does not come to be exploited despite some good opportunities.Yamato undoubtedly has better action scenes and a certain point of suspense. Legend on the other hand, does not need that. read more

12531,23273,27,"""A famous violinist once said that by exchanging (musical) notes, you get to know one another; to understand one another. As if your souls were connected, and hearts overlapping. It's a conversation through instruments. A miracle that creates harmony. In that moment, music transcends words.""Kids on the Slope has its two MALE leads connect via music. There's every suggestion that the thugish drummer would like to pound more than his drums as they compete and connect by playing jazz together. The glasses-wearing, scrawny lead finds liberation by escaping from the restrictions of classical piano playing and happiness by bonding with his 'friend'. The show does try to mask the homosexual undercurrent with heterosexual romance subplots for both characters, but since music is the main focus, both subplots remain on a road to nowhere. And, fittingly, the male leads end together... in a spiritual sense, at least. It's all too obvious the series was created by a female, both in terms of top/bottom character designs and the actual content.Shigatsu is a far more male-orientated, shounen experience. The piano playing lead in Shigatsu is still very much four-eyed and scrawny, just like the lead in Slope, but his musical performance partner is a beautiful long-haired blonde violinist. The same way jazz liberated the lead in Slope, the heroine in Shigatsu injects life into its male lead by inspiring him with her rock-star style violin playing and energy; prompting him to be her partner. Like Slope, there's also romantic subplots with other characters, but it's crystal clear the musical pairing will later pair up in other, just as passionate ways. Maybe.Also, although it's just a matter of preference, I prefer Shigatsu's shouenish FREAK OUT humour over Slope's more subdued, realistic tone. That's a key difference between the two. Shigatsu presents an inexplicably anime mental block issue over piano playing, yet it's never as depressing as Slope because of the injection of humour. Childish but fun. Also-also: THE MUSICAL PERFORMANCES. A lot of attention was put into them; especially in Slope where an actual person did the drumming motions. And the violin playing in Shigatsu was equally captivating. read more 
Despite the music genre difference (Classical and Jazz), both are set during their high school years and have the recurring theme of the musical arts, romance and drama. Each have a pair of musicians whom they end up meeting in a life changing fate and are quite unorthodox but are able to perfom spectacular music! Love polygons exists in both shows and each character has their own set of life-changing problems and trauma. It's a must watch for those who enjoy the musical arts and drama! 
Both anime display some similarities:- Both are about music: Sakamichi relies on classical and jazz whereas the ost can be wonderfully adapted to the characters feelings and humour. Shigatsu's ost is very calming and more classical but also fits the drama.- Main guy is a megane who is a genius pianist but is uninspired and traumatized until he meets someone who makes him regain his love for music and life. Both are likeable protagonists that were forced to learn music and because of that lost the ability to enjoy it, but actually they love music.- The person who inspires the hero to play again also plays an instrument. In Sakamichi is another boy and in Shigatsu it is a girl. - Friendship is also a main theme where a group of friends tags along and has fun being that crucial to the plot.- Hints of romance: While in Sakamichi the romance seems to be a love triangle and not much important to the plot, in Shigatsu the heroine might play a bigger part in the hero's development. Personally I believe Sakamichi is targeted to an older audience and better developed than Shigatsu but both are very enjoyable and have wonderful instrumental music, as well as unique artwork. read more 
Both are music orientated with the male protagonist who is a quiet, calm composed  pianist. They both have romantic acquaintances as well as other family issues 
Both are series that focus on teenage piano-playing glasses-wearing protagonists who encounter romance in their lives. The only difference is that the main character of Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso plays music with a girl, unlike in Sakamichi no Apollon where the main character plays music with other guys. 
Both revolve around the idea of finding yourself and expressing your most inner emotions through music, though with shigatsu this is the focal point, whilst with sakamichi it's supplementary. Both bring out the best in their genre of music with unforgettable soundtracks. Pitch perfect performances from both protagonists. 
Both shows use music as a medium for character development and growth, as well as to connect the characters together. Both have great soundtracks and fluid animation, especially in Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, art plays a fundamental role in the music scenes to forge appropriate symbolism and motifs, as well as to aid and compliment the experience delivered to the audience. They both constantly emphasise the epiphany felt by the characters because of music.Shigatsu is based on classical music whereas Kids on the Slope (Sakamichi no Apollon) is based on jazz music and both are set in very distinct times and settings. Shigatsu is more modern, while the latter is set around the 1960s.   read more 
Both involve a main character of classical piano training, and another that plays an instrument more....unconventionally, freely. Both series made me view music differently in terms of how people play music, as well as motivations behind each, and character devolopment. 
★Both revolve around a group of teenagers, which share a powerful bond and have fun as their youths fly by.★Both contain wonderful music, each one tackling a different genre.★Both have beautiful animation.★Both have a unique mood/atmosphere and feel very realistic + they portray their respective surroundings very well. 
both of them was a Romance-Music themed anime, where between Romance Story and the Musical Scene have a balanced strength on itWhile Shigatsu have a Junior High School student for main Character, Sakamichi's main character was a Senior High School studentShigatsu plays a Classical Music, Sakamichi plays a Jazz Music 
Kids on the Slope arguably has better musical performances and a more complex love web to boot. It's not as MC focused or melodramatic as Your Lie in April, so it's a nice choice for people who are looking for another music orientated anime that is similar enough for those fans longing for that sense of nostalgia but different enough so that it doesn't feel like you're rewatching Your Lie in April. For those who like good music and awkward teenage angst.  
Both animes are similar in the sense that they focus on character development over plot. This is done by using music to convey emotion and strengthen bonds. Also, both animes have an underlying romance theme. 
Both have beautiful music, Kids on the Slope is a mixture of Jazz with Classical piano while Your Lie in April is all classical piano/violin. The stories to both involve themes of romance and friendship shown through music. I would give the edge to Your Lie in April but if you liked one then you are sure to like the other. 
While it hasn't fully completed airing, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso shares the same themes of music and friendship that are prevalent in Sakamichi no Apollon. Although Sakamichi no Apollon did it fairly better. 
Your Lie in April is to classical as Kids on the Slope is to jazz. Both shows have superb soundtracks that work perfectly with the show to capture the best attributes of each musical genre. On top of this, both shows involve a love web between lovable characters trying to find themselves through their music. If you watch either of these, expect to be left in emotional shambles.Coincidently, these are my brother's two favorite shows. Lol, nerd. 
Shigatsu and Sakamichi. Both series:- They are about a pianist, who has a demotivation, the root of his family, which has turned him into an indecisive, which is achieved with a person who will encourage him to pursue his dreams, and to leave behind those pressures of the past. In addition this person plays an instrument, which together they will make the music that will give meaning to their lives.- These series deal with loyalty, friends, who will always be there to support you despite the entanglements that life brings. A romantic story, where love will flavor the facts that support the characters to move forward. read more 
The two are school life dramas that integrate music into the plot. These shows will give you a roller coaster of emotions through their awesome visuals, well-crafted characters and masterful story telling. Your ears are also in for a treat as you listen to excellently performed classical music in Shigatsu was Kimi no Uso and jazz in Sakamichi no Apollon.  
Both has a glasses wearing, pianist guy as protagonist. Both also mainly telling about friendship, romance, and drama between each of the character, accompanied (no pun intended) by music as the theme of both anime.The difference is Shigatsu using classical piece as the theme while Sakamichi using jazz as the theme. 
Both musicalMain character is pianistThe characters & highschool romance are similar somehowBut Shigatsu for classic music & sakamichi is concerned with jazz 
Both involve music and sadness, but in varying degrees. 
Both series are fantastic stories about friendship, music and love. 
You could say that Sakamichi is the 'mature' version of Shigatsu. Here are my reason to watch Sakamichi no Apollon if you loved Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso:- Both focus around music as the main play of each story- Both have emotional parts in the anime- Both have a beautiful soundtrack- Both have lovable characters that the viewer can totally relate toThe only thing that may put you off is that Sakamichi is a lot more mature than Shigatsu. Enjoy! 
On the outside looking in you could say they are similar because both shows focus on music throughout the series but I recommend this show because they have the same undertone and feel to them. If you have seen one of these shows and liked it, I highly recommend you watch the other.    
- They both are really good animes.- The music takes a big relevance in both stories, Sakamichi in jazz and Shigatsu in classical. - The art is pretty good and they have romance there too. - And both of the MC are piano players with glasses and a little geeks xD 
-They both share somewhat the same type of male lead-Both revolve around a group of teenagers as they handle life their own way-YLIA is definitely for the more emotional types of watchers-Both are made around a particular type of music as it's base 
- Music-themed- If you like Sakamichi no Apollon and its soundtrack, listen to the classical soundtrack by the greats like Chopin, Beethoven, Mozart, etc.- Male-oriented; the main character is a sad prodigy musician Kousei- Also romance-themed- The angst 
To a musician such as myself, Sakamichi no Apollon, or Kids on the Slope is basically the jazz version of Your Lie in April. Of course, there are vast differences in the plots of both, but the music is what appeals to an individual like myself first and foremost. "
12531,28735,17,"Both are based on Josei manga. They have a similar art style, and the characters are somewhat similar. I have a hard time seeing someone enjoy one without enjoying the other. 
Two fantastic historical dramas featuring excellent characters. They each capture their time period wonderfully (the two actually overlap quite a bit for a chunk of Rakugo Shinjuu). Lots of jazz, drama, and a love triangle at the heart of it all. They offer different takes of a somewhat similar premise: Rakugo Shinjuu is much more rooted in the darker things of the human heart, whereas Kids on the Slope tends to be a bit more lighthearted. If you like the history, setting, characters, and mood of one, give the other a try. 
-Both are stories of unlikely friendships built while following a similar passion-The main characters seem like perfect foils of each other, one reserved and one energetic -A bit of a love triangle in both- A similar era, the Shouwa era in Japan, but in a different setting, one in the city and the other in the country Both are beautifully told, emotional stories, and the setting is what I believe to be the decider. Sakamichi angles in more on the  youth wanted to rebel against the stifling authority of this era and express themselves through this foreign music called jazz. Meanwhile, Rakugo Shinju is about artists struggling to hold on to a tradition that is being threatened by a changing world. read more 
The character personality frameworks and interactions are nearly the same. Both for older audiences. Both have a very nice, pristine, slice of life style to them whilst being set in the past. If you want to watch something peaceful that evokes emotion (that comes in many forms), these are the shows for you. 
Stiff, reserved, cold character meets and shares the same passion as expressive, outgoing character. Though they are opposite, they end up developing a very close, brotherly bond. Characters are all complex in their own right. Similar (kind of, not really) romantic complications.  
Both titles are period dramas set in the Shōwa era with a decidedly older (generally female) audience in mind. They both center around a group of artists engaging in a performing art while strengthening their emotional ties to one another. They also have similar aesthetic properties, such as plenty of pastoral Japanese imagery and a focus on body language as the main complement to their expressive animation. Though music serves different purposes in both titles, both titles feature a soundtrack that incorporates a fair share of jazz.  
(as of episode one of Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinju) They are both period dramas based on Josei manga focusing on people learning performing arts.  
both of these animes primarily take place during japan's reconstruction after world war 2, both follow the stories of polar opposites who share a common love for their art form (Rakugo and Jazz). It is no surprise that with the clash of asian and western culture spawns a fertile ground for many art forms to grow and adapt into modern japan. While one series tries to keep the traditional japanese world alive the other is a story immersed in western culture. Both series have a solid main cast of characters and are well worth the time to watch. 
Much like Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu, Sakamichi no Apollon is character driven. It focuses on the daily machinations of its characters and the art form they practice. The time period and tone of both shows are extremely similar and they both have that cool, mature feeling. 
-Character driven-Centring around two boys that are complete opposites-Brash Rowdy Kid and Bookish Quiet Kid become unlikely, begrudging friends-Bit of a love triangle-A little heartwarming, but also heartbreaking -Both shows are based on performance arts Music/ Rakugo-Set in late past Japan-Unique animation-Killer Openings 
They are both stories about two youthful guys and their dreams. Arts are involved. While Sakamichi no Apollon deals with music Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu deals with the art of storytelling (rakugo).Also a bit of romance is involved where the two guys are interested in the same girl.Afaik they are based on jousei manga because women in Japan seem to like stories about guys? I myself as a guy can say: I liked them both because as I guy I also like stories between guys. It's easy to understand the guys' motivations and behaviour even if it seems irrational sometimes.They are both character-driven and the romance does not take a big part of the screentime. It's more about the guys and the relationship between them and the hobby/work that connects them. read more 
Both stories have similar character archetypes, are packed with drama, and take place in a historical setting. The main character of both series are pretty gloomy and serious and have an outgoing troublemaker as their foil.The stories are vastly different, as Sakamichi follows high schoolers in a slice of life setting and Rakugo follows a clearly defined story of a man over the course of his life. However, the characters and overall feel of the series are similar. If you enjoyed one, you'll probably enjoy the other. 
The love for performing arts becomes evident in both Josei anime. Romantic relationships are complex, the characters memorable and authentic – as if they were real people. It's beautiful. 
Both being based off of Josei manga, they a similar feel in that the two protagonists have contrasting personalities; one is conformist, straight-faced and ordered while the other is unruly, wild and unconventional. Both sets of protagonists have a strong bond that intertwines with an accompanying third female character, helping to progress the plot as well as their respective relationships. They both have a similar feel and art style to them, and a creative technique (music vs rakugo) is central to both. If you enjoyed Sakamichi, you'll almost definitely like Shouwa just as much, if not more so.  
It is quite rare to find a show that doesn't just focus on either its story, or its characters, especially one that manages to handle both well. If you fell in love with the way the Sentarou and Kaouru interact, then you will no doubt feel right at home here watching Sukeroku and Yakumo argue life out. The way Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu introduces its viewers to the art of Rakugo, is similar to the way Skamichi no Apollon introduces its viewers to the world of Jazz. The way Sakamichi no Apollon makes you fall in love with its music, Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu will make you fall in love with the Art of Rakugo. The same way Sakamichi no Apollon makes you cry when it wants to, Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu will do, many times. read more 
Both shows deal with 2 completely polar opposite characters developing a special relationship over the art they love. There is also a challenging love triangle in each of the shows that serves as the leading cause for the drama 
Both are anime about finding yourself through a chosen form. Both adapted of a josei manga "
12531,57,17,"Beck is a modern high school coming-of-age story where a nobody becomes a somebody by becoming a member of a rock band. Kids on the Slopes is a josei romance drama disguised as a high school coming-of-age story centered around jazz in the 1960's.On the surface the two series appear similar. They both use music as a way of introducing and connecting their characters with the rest of the cast; including love interests that act as motivational factors. However, where as jazz is just a means to romantic ends in Kids on the Slopes, in Beck music is the most important aspect: it's the driving force of a story where character growth is linked into the titular band's successes and failures. There's a romance subplot in Beck that causes frustration and rage, for sure, but there's no denying that Beck is, first and foremost, about music.Kids on the Slopes' greatest problem is this: its manga was serialised in a magazine called 'Flowers'. Hardly the ideal platform for a coming-of-age story with a a male lead, and that shows through; both in terms of the romantic focus AND male lead characterisation that's overly feminine. Jazz barely gets a look-in aside from when the cast hang out together. In contrast, Beck is more male-orientated with its lead's characterisation, and although romance gets far less attention, the heroine has caused anger in more than one fan for being realistically bitchy. That sort of naturalness is missing from Kids on the Slopes with its far more shoujo / soap operaish approach to romance. In short: if you're looking for something shoujoish with music on the side, watch Kids on the Slopes. If you're a male looking for a coming-of-age story centered around music, watch Beck. Simple as that.  read more 
The similar part is that both anime are for high school students who play music.The difference is that Sakamichi no Apollon is more about the love stories of the characters and is full of cliches, while Beck is more about music and characters' development as persons through music. 
If you're musician or you just enjoy heartwarming stories featuring music and romance, then both shows are must-watch. 
Similar premise, just replace Jazz music with Rock music as the main music focus. Characters are all in high school as well in both, however Beck takes place in present day. 
Tbh, I found these two series quite alike in terms of their pace and feeling when watching them.Both Beck and Sakamichi no Apollon (also known as Kids on the Slope) explores the theme of music and how the main characters of the series embraces them.Both series' artwork is naturalistic and has realism that reflects the older ages compared to the more modern 2000's style.Both series has a slice of life theme in it that features comedy, drama, and romance.Both series are a breath of fresh air so give it a shot. 
It's not only about music. BECK - ROCK, Sakamichi - JAZZ.But also it's slice of life about musicians lifes. About problems of everyone of us, because everyone've got plenty of them. It's about how hard is love, friendship and keeping your existence in society. 
Both of these titles are set in the present and feature high school kids as the main characters. There is a great deal of high school drama, but at the end of the day the characters best relate through music. Beck is much more lighthearted and funny; kids on the slope tries to be more thoughtful. Both are excellent animes. 
In my opinion, there are only two kinds of animes. Drama and Action.Beck and Sakamichi share a feeling through the whole series. The action is slow and you can't expect a bloody gunfight every episode. The characters will always be presented as very simple, but the more you dive into the understanding of the characters meaning in the series, you will obtain that everyone has a light and a dark side. The character you thought were a ugly scumbag, will maybe turn out to be the nicest character in anime history! Judge the book by the content, not the cover.Also, both animes has a love to music. Beck is for all the rock/pop-lovers, and Sakamichi is for 60's jazz. Both animes will create a big view of both genres, and you will understand why the music-culture is very important. If you don't like this kind of music, you should consider watching either Beck or Sakamichi.Last but not least, both animes aren't just about music. Actual themes is also friendship, love, hard work and accomplishing goals and following dreams! read more 
same music but smaller and better than beck less complicated some times and some time more complicated then beck unfortunate it doesn't have a ending like beck which can keep the viewer hoping that there would be more. so to sum it up smaller and better similar in a lot of ways love music and a whole lot of fun included that kids on slope for you :) 
Music, Music, Music. While Beck deals with rock music, Sakimichi no Apollon deals with jazz. If you're a fan of jazz, this is a must-watch. Add that to the brilliant writing and character development, and you get one of the best shows a music fan could watch. 
Both series focus on teenage kids learning how to play music and having fun doing so.Despite one being focused on rock, and the other on Jazz, with one taking place in modern-day Japan, and one taking place in 1960s Japan, they still both have a very similar tone to their presentation, as well as similarities between the characters and their experiences in learning music. 
Both are about a band and their struggles revolving around music 
both revolve around music and have a beautiful story of friendship. They are also both shows that will be remembered for their great music played. They are both a must watch, so if you have seen one go and watch the other NOW!! 
Both presents coming of age story. There is romance. Male lead is a boring boy who turn to be musician after binding friendship with problematic boy 
Music, feelings, and drama with Slice of life style  
If you like Sakamichi no Apollon/Kids on the Slope, then I think Beck/Mongolian Chop Squad might be right up your alley. Both series are about young people performing music and growing as a result of their exploration of the art. They both work as coming of age stories, with characters in both plots becoming different people by the end of their respective narratives. Beck is a bit more gritty than Kids on the Slope as it takes place in the mid 2000s and focuses on young rockers trying to make a name for themselves. It isn't quite as visually charming but I still found it to be well done for the time in which it released. It's also longer at 26 episodes, but it starts to go a lot faster the deeper in you go.I wholeheartedly believe you'll enjoy Beck if you enjoyed Kids on the Slope as both series explore the performance and love of music as a way of developing lasting social bonds. They may have a different feel to them but the themes of friendship, growing up and changing oneself are strong in both anime. Both shows teach us that music can help us change and grow as people. read more 
Ok imma say it straight up, Sakamichi no Apollon is just Beck but jazzSame mood and feel plus both of the character rosters of the mentioned show are really well-written and characterized. Definitely recommend Sakamichi no Apollon if you like Beck and music anime in general. "
12531,1698,12,"Both definitely have a similar feeling, ""Nodame Cantabile"" is about classical music, where ""Kids on the Slope"" is about jazz, but they both have the same goal that you should enjoy the music your playing and give it feeling and not just playing it like it's written on the music sheet. 
Both josei romances that center around a musical theme. Even though Nodame Cantabile is about classical music and Sakamichi no Apollon is about jazz, they both give you a very similar feel (minus Nodame Cantabile being absolutely hilarious).  
Both josei romances that center around a musical theme. Even though Nodame Cantabile is about classical music and Sakamichi no Apollon is about jazz, they both give you a very similar feel (minus Nodame Cantabile being absolutely hilarious). 
Both give you a look into a genre of music that is no longer mainstream.Kids on the Slope focuses on Jazz while Nodame Cantabile focuses on classical. 
In both anime it is music that unites people. 
Both are Joseis and are about music.There are romance and student environment in Japan.However there are some differences between each other:Sakamichi no Apollon  takes place in a secundary school on the sixties years; the kind of music played by main characters is the Jazz.Nodame Cantabile TV takes place in a music faculty on the present days; the kind of music played by main characters is the Classical Music.If you like a good music, like Jazz and Classical, you should watch these animes!!!If you like a good story, with romance, some comedy, drama of daily life; you may like too!! 
Both series has a josei genre and thus have a similar feeling and style.Music plays a major theme in both series that also involves romance as well as drama and comedyBoth series are quite realistic and some of the characters have similar personalities.  
Both are slice of life's in which a group of young people are brought together by their love for music. 
Its about music altough Sakamichi Apollon is more real in showing relationships and emotions. 
It might seem at first sight that the josei genre be the most striking similarity and although the musical themes are different:In ""Nodame Cantabile"" music is speaking in tones of among others Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Franz Peter Schubert, Claude Debussy und Sergei Wassiljewitsch Rachmaninow (transcription: Rachmaninoff). So an musical framework of classical gems is presented.In contrast does ""Sakamichi no Apollon"" presents the musical spirit of Jazz in the 60ties with the sound of George Gershwin, Miles Davis, Charlie Parker and Duke Ellington.Nevertheless or better that is precisely why the main visible, extremely fastidious driving force in both anime, is an highly elaborated combination of story and qualities of dedication and innovation which symbolizes the love for music that always do inspire musicians. (personal note: in the case of ""Sakamichi no Apollo"" do skip the episode 12, because with the spirit of Jazz the end doesn't harmonize at all).Both anime do have flaws but if you are fond of music, these two anime are excellent and none mainstream. They get across quite realistic, in regard to feelings and style and moreover showing well portrayed relationships and emotions. read more 
Both series involve 2 characters who are completely polar opposites in character, come together through their mutual admiration of music. Both series' also focus more on the characters and their interactions, rather than the actual story 
Both move one's heart! If you liked sakamichi Apollon for its feel then there is a 9/10 chance you will also like Nodame Cantabile! "
12531,39533,6,"Both are about two high school boys who love music. While Sakamichi is not categorized as Shounen Ai, the two main boys relationship can easily be interpreted as a romantic one with how close they become and how clearly they care for one another.  
Music is the the driving theme of these anime and also romance. Both quite different in terms of story, but equally as enjoyable.  
Given is less depressing and more happy than Apollon. It is also gayer and replaces the jazz music with rock. If you want something more lighthearted with character focus and a music oriented theme, Given is for you. 
If you're looking for something that focuses mainly on music, Given and Apollon are the right choices. They also deal with love and friendship, although the main topic is music. 
Kids on the Slope and Given connect based on music mostly, but there’s also the theme of friendship and romance present in both. In both of them, two people get closer based on their love for music, and the main protagonists are both new to what they’re doing. 
Similarities:-Both have to do with music-Both are really sad-The MC give off the same vibe "
12531,877,6,"Both series have a very mature approach in romance and relationships. Music is also an important factor in both series, but romance and drama predominate. 
They are very similar:* Both are Josei, Slice of life, drama* The two male protagonists from SNA are like the female protagonists from Nana, being great friends even with their differences.* The love story in both have realism and conflicts (but I think there are more conflicts in Nana)* They are about music I'm sure if you like one you'll like the other. 
Both are about music, and characters who have to deal with complicated love stories and familial issues, as well as being rejected by society. Both also show a strong friendship between two main characters who are totally the opposite but actually closer than with anyone else, and who can support each others in difficult times. 
Both are about music and finding more about yourself. 
Both series are about music dealing with friendship, rivalry, and love complications. Both series has a josei type of feeling.Both series has drama with complicated storyline.Both series has a great pace of story.Both series contain interesting characters.Both series explores the realism of a love and music.Both series are a must-watch. 
Music theme, drama and a lot of feelings and love "
12531,1,4,"SOULFUL narrative from the industry's best, the legendary duo, director Watanabe Shinichiro and music composer Yoko Kanno 
If you really like jazz, this is a show, set in the sixties, about a boy who forms friends through music. 
From the same director, and with a lot of marvelous music. It blend space scientific fiction, old west and blues/jazz/folk to create a unique theme. 
Same writer/director, same composer. Recommended for people who watched Bebop and loved the music, but perhaps wanted to see the music incorporated even more into the plot. You don't have to be a musician or even a music fan to like either of these series. The inclusion of jazz in the development of Watanabe's always wonderful characters makes for an extremely heartfelt and short series. "
12531,22135,4,"Sakamichi no Apollon and Ping Pong the Animation feature two bespectacled protagonists, Kaoru and Smile who are taciturn and withdrawn but have a skill and passion brought out by catalyst characters Sentarou and Peco.Sakamichi's common theme may be Jazz and Ping Pong's ping pong however, it's not about the topic itself, it's about people, their ambitions, their challenges, their relationships with others, and why they play.    
Both these animes have a certain theme (Ping Pong for one, Jazz for the latter), but focus rather on the characters, their relations toward each other and their evolution, than on the main theme itself.The MCs have lots of common points. 
Despite differences, Kids on the Slope mirrors Ping Pong by being about the same thing. Behind the facades of ping pong and jazz music, both deal with relationships and the difficulties associated with them.  They are both very honest in their approach toward the content.  They differ, mainly, in their approach.  Kids on the Slope is much more conventional, while Ping Pong, being directed by Yuasa, arguably has more style.  Both are masterpieces, but Ping Pong is definitely more distinguishable of the two series.      
Both animes are superb coming of age stories that might make you reconsider your goals in life. While alienating at first Ping Pongs visual style will quickly suck you into fast paced matches "
12531,30346,3,"Similar to Doukyuusei, this anime features: - two male protagonists who are very different from each other; one is smart, reserved, wealthy, and a bit of a loner, while the other is eccentric, lively, poor, and a bit of a troublemaker. The two of them are classmates, and they are both misunderstood. As a result of their opposite personalities and lifestyles, they foil one another and grow closer as the story progresses.- musical themes. The two male protagonists develop their friendship through their common passion for jazz music.- plenty of feels and romance. Unlike Doukyuusei, it's not shounen ai, but you can certainly view it that way~In general, both Doukyuusei and Sakamichi no Apollon are rather light, fun, and upbeat (save for the drama, of course), and they effortlessly whisk your heart away into their beautiful world of love, youth, and music! read more 
-Heartwarming-School Theme-Strange quiet tranquillity-Low stakes, low stress -Rowdy Troublemaker/ Bespectacled Student trope-Interesting, dream-like animation 
They both have a very natural, easy going school-time, summer-vibes type atmosphere, and both shows put a lot of emphasis on character dynamics and do a good job of capturing the overall feel of being a young and in love.  "
12531,9989,3,"They both revolve around love and friendship..both are based around multiple friends who love each other. Both will make you cry, laugh and experience tons of emotions and feelings at once. Both are amazing. Both are masterpieces. 
Both are stories of unrequited love that will lift you up... They share similar themes like school and friendship, but it's really that melodramatic and lighthearted feeling you get when you're watching both of these titles.Both are fulfilling titles that will ensure laughter, sadness, sympathy, and a sense of ""what a beautiful story this was"" as you look back. 
-the story is about a group of friends -character end up falling in love with each other-the sad atmosphere -the unique characters -both are really good animes worth to be watched  "
12531,4181,2,"Both anime can be very tear jerking and really fun to watch with it's in depth characters 
1.Both of the series have beautiful romance and not-so-annoying love triangles. 2. They are both heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time.3. They start off at a high school and show the hardships of life after high school as well. "
12531,6114,2,"- Similar setting and atmosphere: Mid 20th century Japan, which means the characters in these two shows face the same kind of struggles; the after-WW2-poverty and the absence of fathers for some reason or another. - Music—jazz—is present in both series, more in SnA of course. - They will give you the same warm, sad, yet beautiful feeling while watching. - Real BROMANCE, friends through good and bad who support each other more than brothers do. - Finally, I personally consider both to be bright examples of modern time classics; so wonderful and classy, a must watch for serious anime fans. 
Similar atmosphere, same feeling, similar setting, lots of drama and both takes place shortly after World War 2. If you enjoyed one, you would totally enjoy the other! "
5081,37450,91,"Bunny Girl is basically a less verbose version of Bakemonogatari, complete with the anthology setup of the main guy, who comes off as a sarcastic prick but is secretly super nice, helps the waifu of the week come to terms with her social anxieties and hangups that supernaturally manifest in very literal ways. The snappy dialogue and instant chemistry between the leads makes both shows a very fun watch, but Bunny Girl is much more accessible. 
Main guy is just your normal guy trying to help a bunch of girls with their issues. Their issues have realistic causes, but supernatural symptoms. There is also an obvious romance in both. Bunny Girl doesn't have all the word-play and quirky Shaft animation. 
- Girls afflicted by supernatural/spiritual phenomena- Main guy helps the girls - Predominantly female characters- Main guys both a little bit pervy/cheeky- Main girls in each are very tsundereOverall similar shows but both unique and if you watch one it doesnt feel like you're watching a rip off if you watch the other 
If you enjoyed Bunny Girl Senpai, then you will enjoy it's original inspiration.Bakemonogatari is more dialogue driven in the best way possible (being much more complex and witty as well as thought provoking). In addition, the art style is one of a kind - I've yet to watch an anime as visually interesting in the particular way that Bakemonogatari (as well as the entire Monogatari series adapted from the many light novels) perfectly executes. Not only is this the most involved anime I've had the pleasure of watching, but it entraps my full and constant attention with thoroughly fleshed-out characters, clever humor, and entertaining plots. The story is not only well-crafted, but as I mentioned previously, both the dialogue AND the visuals hold nearly equal attention in the story-telling which is why they can feel unnervingly subtle and yet bold and brightly colorful at the very same time resulting in a gorgeous narrative I wholly recommend.Bunny Girl Senpai is by no means bad in comparison in my personal opinion, however it tends to lend itself to being more easily digestible by the general public. So if you enjoyed it for any reason, please give the Monogatari series a try, starting with Bakemonogatari! Thank you for reading! read more 
Despite it's title, it's a more innocent, more drama and less action playoff of the Bakemonogatari idea, and the Clannad idea (not After Story). Before talking about the similarities, these are both absolutely touching shows and deserve your attention even if you've seen the other. They both have a fresh take on things. A seemingly typical guy, who keeps his distance from others, notices a girl keeping her distance from others. Why are they keeping their distance? Because they each have a secret. Our main man, Sakuta has been dealing with his issues for years, and finds a girl who is in desperate need of help. Of course Mai won't ask for it, at first.These issues are all of the haunted/apparition type.  He saves her, they end up together, but of course that's only the first few episodes. Then he'll stumble onto another girl and selflessly end up helping her. read more 
Bunny Girl Senpai is to Bakemonogatari what cold pizza is to pizza. While being a lot less verbose it explores the same kind of narative. 
Same vibes, oddities/puberty syndrome, harem, tsundere girlfriend... 
""Aobuta"" shares many similarities with the Monogatari Series.The story is about a high school boy meeting different girls with supernatural phenomenon and helping them solve their problems.The main character seems unsocial and his classmates always misunderstand him. But actually he is a straightforward boy, and willing to help people around him.The heroine is a pretty and cool girl with long black hair. She has a bit of sadism and sharp tougue, and often plays tricks on the main character. 
MC dealing with main heroine's problem in the first arc and helping another girl in next arcs. MC and main heroine's relationship in both series are similar. 
While I don't think these two are as similar as others who instantly compared the two. They do share some themes and structure, while differing in pacing and tone. If you enjoyed one you're fairly likely to enjoy the other, as I enjoyed both immensely, though for different reasons. The main similarity are to me is how the story is laid out. Story arcs in both focus on the cast of heroins and their supernatural problems that stem from and reflect their preexisting psychological hangups. The girls solve their problems by working together with the subdued, quick witted, and hilariously straightforward male protagonist of the respective series. I think these protagonists are where these anime differ from many others in such a positive way. He is not a ""blank slate."" They feel much more realistic and likable. One of the main reasons being that they are both in committed relationships throughout the series, and have genuine romantic chemistry with their girlfriends. You just don't see this much. In both of these shows there are a lot of girls who could be just another potential love-interest for him, if this were your typical harem-romance-drama series. While they are clear that they find these other girls are attractive, they're committed and loyal to their girlfriend, both of which happen to be the first they save in the series. (not chronologically in Monogatari's case)The differences in the shows is the tone and pacing.  Monogatari is more humerus and has more action, not that necessarily makes it better. Monogatari is a lot more fast paced and is full of subtle jokes, deep-cut Japanese pop culture references and puns. (Even the name is a pun.) Whereas Bunnygirl Senpai is  more serious overall, but not without humor. Monogatari can be and is often serious, but overall is a lot more off-the-walls than Bunnygirl Senpai, which is more dramatic and realistic. They're not the same, not a copy-paste at allThe most important thing I can say is that I doubt say Bunnygirl Senpai will always hold up like Monogatari, it's mostly because it just finished airing that it has so much attention. After all, Monogatari is one of my favorite shows of all time, and Bunnygirl Senpai was my just favorite of this season, only time will tell. read more 
First of all, not only Bakemonogatari, but all the monogatari serie. It is very similar to the point that there's something weird going on with a female character for a ahort period of time and that the main character try to understand the situation and then save the girl. Monogatari have more dialogue and less actions than Bunny Girl and less character, indeed there's no background character in monogatari, it looks like they live in an emlty town. But if you liked bunny girl, you'll probably enjoy the monogatari serie! 
Main guy goes around solving the supernatural dilemmas of various waifus alongside witty dialogue. 
both animes have the male mc finding out that a girl they had met has a supernatural problem that has affected their lifestyle, and then both end up helping the girl. after helping that girl, both mcs meet more girls with supernatural problems as well, and would take a couple of episodes to solve the girl's problem, one after the other, as both mcs try their very best to help each girl. 
Very similar in terms of plot and characters. The main guy helps other girls who suffer from a supernatural phenomenon and of course, some of them fall in love with him. The main couples are also very similar in both shows. 
- Both shows are Drama/RomComs with supernatural elements where the MC tries to fix other characters problems.- Also in both anime the main romantic relationship is established very early on. 
“Poor man’s Monogatari”Long story short:troubled girls are saved by a sarcastic MC.Same “harem”-ish style,same interesting dialogue and the same special “tsundere” main female character.Even so,there are a lot of differences in quality. 
They both feature a lowkey pervy boy that runs into girls with supernatural issues that he helps them solve. They're both harems in a way, but the MC kind of chooses one girl from the beginning and proceeds to flirt around afterward in both shows. Let's just say that the MC in Rascal Does Not Dream is more loyal than the one in Bakemonogatari. They're both full of snippy comedy and great dialogue as well.  
Both focus around paranormal/supernatural occurrences.Female and Male MC's strongly resemble each otherMale MC finds the need to save others from these supernatural occurrencesInitial Arc establishes relationship between lead male and female Character driven series  
A guy trying to solve some girls problems that envolve supernatural stuff and something about their past/personality, has Romance, if u like trippy vibes u will like Bakemonogatari more if u like more normal slice of life then Bunny Girl, also Bakemonogatari misterys and everything tends to be more Complex 
Arcs that follow one girl with supernatural issues caused by trauma/feelingsKinda similar character (tsundere girlfriend, imoutu...etc)Seishun buta is less weird though  
Central theme of both stories is very similar (MC helping girls with their sobrenatural problems) And the relationship between both partners, is very similar. 
It narrates similar story tropes but Bakemonogatari actually has good characters, a mindblowing animation, an eargasmic ost and, of course, one of the best story telling in anime 
For once there is actually a show that is similar to Monogatari. Both shows involve the MC dealing with supernatural problems involving a wide range of girls. In both shows, while there's a main love interest that spans the series, there are small elements of harems for the MC's.Both shows also have unique interactions between the characters and contain ample amounts of witty humor 
The Monogatari series is deeper than bunny girl senpai. Bunny girl senpai is like a light-hearted version of the Monogatari series but offers characters that are easier to relate and connect to. I recommend the Monogatari series for good character studies and its visuals. 
If you didn't like Bakemonogatari for it being verbose, flashy, or unconventional but still enjoyed some of the themes used than Bunny Girl Senpai might be for you. Bakemonogatari will give you more memorable characters and is all-around better written but if you are looking for something more simple then Bunny Girl is the way. 
seishun buta is monogatari if monogatari had nothing of weight to say or convey 
Both stories follow a Male lead trying to help a bunch of girls with their problems related to the unnatural 
Both try to explore problems that people face via more literal supernatural elements (spirits in Monogatari and adolecense syndrome in Seishun Buta Yarou). Where Bake more focuses on interal conflicts and problems relating to themselves, Seishun Buta Yarou focuses on an individual's interactions and place within a societal context (and then by proxy, how it affects them). Both however, are still good in both rights. There are also other small similarites that a fan of one can recognise in the other but they both still feel like fresh and interesting series in their own ways. 
Both shows have a note of the supernatural things, that happening around main characters: the hero of this story is still a high school student, who meets a girl with supernatural phenomenon and helping her to solve a  problem. Also, main heroine  has a personality of ""tsundere"": sometimes, she can be angry to protagonist and even rude him, but on the other hand,  she loves him and feel safety with MC. Besides it, in both animes slip philosophical and scientific thoughts. 
The story lines are very similar and equally interesting! The main character seems to be a pushover when in reality he has a righteous attitude towards helping others in need. They both walk the line between supernatural and reality; the character's emotions manipulate the world at large through themes of physics and spirituality. The themes are also very philosophical and every episode of Bunny Girl leaves me wondering about how I perceive my world, just like the Bakemonogatari series did. Mild fanservice too! I absolutely recommend both anime.  
Bunny Girl is a rip off exceptGeneric art styleForgettable soundtrackless cynicalless of Shaft's spiceless headtilt™less verboseeasier to consume slightly more clicheBUT STILL GOOD!Self aware deadpan boy highschooler meets long hair self aware girl during a supernatural moment.

Both shows have one main male protagonist with many female characters surrounding him, but what makes both of these shows great is how they both are not  harems. The females in both shows actually have characteristics and are not boring. Also not all of them are falling over romantic for the male protagonist. Both shows character develop their main male protagonist as well as the females very well. 
- Set in modern day with some supernatural elements- Cast of mostly female characters around the highschool age- Protagonist that seems like a normal guy, but has some secrets of his own and helps the girls deal with their supernatural problems- Story split into mini-arcs about each character- Main girl with a sharp tongue and terrible mother- Lots of banter- Straightforward relationship with no misunderstandings or other cliches 
Supernatural mysteryMale lead coolKuudere male lead 
Bakemonogatari has everything you love about Bunny Girl Senpai. Love the interactions between Sakuta and Mai? Senjougahara and Araragi have the same teasing relationship (though a bit more intense) Love the episodic occurrences? They have it too! Love the vibe? Bakemonogatari has tons of it. Plus, this is an absolute staple of the community. The visuals will blow you away, the soundtrack is awesome, and the characters are refreshing +interesting. Bakemonogatari is the type of series that makes me want to dive head first into every character and understand them too. This show is essential.  
Both shows have a similar premise- the main character helps out different girls around him with their supernatural problems- develops a relationship with one of the said girls Bunny girl is definitely a easy watch tho as Bakemonogatari has a lot of conversation heavy episodes  
Bunny Girl is basically a version of Bakemonogatari.Both stories follow the main guy who trying to help some girls to their supernatural/spiritual phenomena that have afflicted them.Personally I liked Bakemonogatari more !! 
These two animes are really very similar. The way the characters are presented, the divisions by arcs of two to three episodes.One difference is that Monogatari is formed by a great harem, while Bunny Girl there is not much of that aspect. 
Main guy is a normal guy trying to help a bunch of girls with their issues. Their issues are supernatural 
Both animes have a similar concept of helping girls who are having problems with supernatural stuff. Also the main male leads are very similar to each other. Both animes also have a bit of mystery that makes you very curious and makes you want to follow it. So, If you like one of them, theres a high chance that you would love the other. 
If you loved Bunny girl senpai, then you'll be interested in Bakemonogatari, vice-versa. I would say that Bakemonogatari is a more wild version of Bunny girl senpai where the art style, the story-telling, and the vibe it radiates are worlds apart, in a good way. Plot-wise, both anime are about a group of individuals facing supernatural phenomenons that have a deep meaning and are eventually saved by the MC, and as you would expect for the romance part, the MC falls for the individual he saves.  
Bunny Girl Senpai is Bakemonogatari without supernatural overload and less harem situations. Bakemonogatari graphic is better, but in Bunny Girl Senpai characyer are more believable (and nicer IMO). 
Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai (""Bunny Girl Senpai"" for short) is an anime in which a high school boy named Sakuta Azusagawa solves the problems within his town relating to a phenomenon knows as ""Puberty Syndrome"". Bakemonogatari has a similar premise in which a high school boy named Koyomi Araragi solves the problems in his area relating to the supernatural (including demons, Kamis, and curses). Each incident spans a few episodes (similar to Bunny Girl Senpai), but each incident has its own opening, adding more character and setting the mood for what is to come. Bunny Girl Senpai's problems must be solved within the day or else the day will repeat. The only people to notice the repeat are those involved in the Puberty Syndrome issue. These anime are distinctly different in everything, but premise. Bunny Girl Senpai has a happier setting while Bakemonogatari has more of a serious, darker tone to it.  read more 
Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai is basically Bakemonogatari but worse. I find the characters, their interactions, the humour, the visuals, the drama, the plot (from what I remember from the manga), the art, sound and basically anything else to be better in Monogatari. If you enjoyed this, Bakemonogatari should blow your mind. On the other hand, Bunny Girl does have a more down to earth feel and is better for people who don't get Bake's humour. 
Both have good elements of paranormal mystery, as well as great character and dialogue writing. They also both have quite good romantic elements, though Monogatari is much longer than Bunny Girl Senpai. 
Both Bunny Girl Senpai and Bakemonogatari share a similar concept where the mc helps out several girls who are experiencing a supernatural phenomenon. The dynamic between the mc and their main love interest in both anime are extremely similar, so if you like the banter then you should definitely check out Bakemonogatari, and all the other seasons in the series. 
Both share similar traits: episodic format, harem, dry humor couple, the supernatural. If you liked Bakemonogatari, Bunny Girl Senpai is right up your alley.  
Both are about a guy just trying to help out girls who's lives have been affected in some supernatural way. Each girl has their own 2-3 episode long arcs and their own op or ed. 
In both shows the MC tries to solve other girls problems in supernatural situations. Bunny girl is a lighter and easier to digest version of Bakemonogatari. 
Just like Sakuta from Bunny Girl Senpai, our Main Protagonist Araragi is also someone who helps others that have supernatural phenomenons occurring to them. While Bunny Girl Senpai was airing, I have seen many threads talking about how they are similar to each other, and yes I can confirm that, but only similar, not exact copies. If you enjoyed bunny girl then the monogatari series is for you! This is the first installment so just look up for the watch order (*cough* release order)  
Bakemonogatari and Bunny Girl Senpai are incredibly similar to eachother, both being about a High School boy solving everyone's supernatural problems and building up a harem of likable girls in the process. Fans of one are very likely to enjoy the other. 
Both shows are driven by the riveting dialogue between the characters. They each offer lifelong wisdom to the attentive viewer, so I would highly recommend both to an watcher looking for a series that inspires contemplation.I would personally start with Bunny Girl Senpai, as it is a bit more approachable. If you find yourself liking this series, then you will undoubtedly enjoy Bakemonogatari as well. 
Similar arcs, with not a visual masterpiece such as Monogatari but with fantastic emotional feelings and with a lot of psychology involved too when you get deeper into the series. 
Both series have a similar way in presenting dialogue. The stories also revolve around supernatural mysteries that have sticked with the girls in which the protagonist has to solve.Bunny girl senpai is more easy to understand than Bakemonogatari, and more accessible to people.  
A romance anime with addition such as supernatural and little bit of mystery things. Both have very similar concept and how story is developed. As the bonus, they have an attractive main heroine. I can say both of them are harem anime because they have many waifu material. Recommended. 
In both there are a number of strange problems, the protagonist who has already gone through one of these problems has a personality that makes him help others who have these ""problems""Besides that in both anime there are characters that look very similar 
- both shows have MC that is kinda perv- there is supernatural phenomena in both shows and MC is helping girls who are affected by it- main girls in both shows (Sakurajima and Senjougahara) have a sharp tongue and an amazing personality  
Very similar themes. The author is actually inspired by Monogatari and Teen Romatic Comdey SNFAU. 
-Both of them are anime that there are some supernatural happenings/powers             -There is a ONIICHAN on both series who cares about others and has sister(s)               
I find it incredible how similar these two are to each other. They both share the same plot of a high school guy helping out a bunch of girls with a supernatural situation that they dealt with before. The characters are also very alike in their personalities and backstories. 
Less mindfuck and abstract dialogue compared to Bakemonogatari.Main cast are witty and their interactions make the show really enjoyable to watch.Both series have a supernatural element, but bakemonogatari leans into it more and explains more of its lore that relates to myths, gods and spirits while in bunny girl senpai its a syndrome, a supernatural disease of sorts.Both OPs and EDs as well OST are amazing in both shows.Bakemonogatari is more unique but often takes time to adjust to its unique way of storytelling.Bunny girl senpai however, does its normally and easy to follow. 
Main character an awesome cool guy helping female characters. Main heroine is similar which they are a tsundere and love the main character. The romance between the main character and the main heroine is similar. They often gives straightforward answer and straightforward lies that makes it funny. 
Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Sempai is pretty much a less weird, less mysterious and less ecchi Bakemongatari. They have a really similar format, in the supernatural ""case of the week"" style, kinda like a erotic anime scooby doo. 
- The premise of the story revolves around a guy, who solves supernatural phenomenons that occur with the large cast of girls- Both are ""light"" harem anime- The lead girls have tsundere traits- Witty dialogue especially with the main lead characters- The main leads get together early on in the anime- Side characters dont interfere significantly with the relationship of the main leads- The main characters are both somewhat unique with a pervy side 
A less lewd, gory version of bakemonogatari. Both have supernatural occurences, but bakemonogatari is more on the yokai side and bunny girl is more on the psychological, theory side. Mc are quite similar. Both have harems and they are helping the girls in the harem. They also both date the first girl introduced and they also have a girl in the past that helped them.  
Both anime focus on a main character trying to help girls with supernatural problems. Nonetheless I like both of them, Bakemonotari is a more artistic anime and their characters are deeper than Bunny girl senpai´s because of the number of episodes dedicated to each girl in Monogatari. Both of them are funny and enjoyable. So since they are very alike but yet very unique if you liked one of them you would probably like the other 
Both involved guys accidentally encountering a ""distressed"" gal.Both involved developing a romance between the 2 MC's; albeit the progression of both occur differently in several aspects.Both involved multiple unusual / supernatural situations,that require solution primarily by the male MC.I totally enormously enjoyed these 2 anime a lot. 
Main similarities: type of relationship between two main characters of the show (Senjougahara and Araragi; Sakurajima and Azusagawa) and male MC helping out to a range of female characters 
Supernatural, Romance, Sweet couple, and best waifus.  
Both the main protagonist will be in charge of helping different girls with paranormal problems. In addition to those starting in anime, Seishun Buta Yarou is more accessible and lighter than Bakemonogatari. 
Witty and pervy but normal and good-hearted main protagonist dealing with female characters' anomalies. The main protagonist then has a romantic relationship with the first female character she helped. Both shows share the same theme, story arc structure, character interactions. Though Bakemonogatari is a dialogue heavy show, mixed in with a little action while Bunny Girl Senpai has more of the dramatic and light hearted approach. 
I know a lot of people have already compared these two and I will probably hit a lot of the same points, but I don't care. For one, both these shows focus on supernatural issues, happening to highschoolers (mainly girls), and having the main character and the first girl healed, help to resolve the issues. Both these shows also have a character that the mc talks to figure out what is happening and what to do. Basically both shows are about supernatural events happening to highschool students, the difference is that Bakemonogatari has a higher bar for entry and enjoyment of the show. So if you liked Bunny Girl-senpai you will enjoy Bakemonogatari. read more 
Both have an MC that wants to help every single girl he meets that has supernatural occurrences Both story are separated into arcs. Bunny girl is a lighter version of Bakemonogatari 
Both are romance shows loosely centered around school, although Bunny Girl has a lot more romance than Bakemonogatari does. They both have heavy supernatural focuses, Bakemonogatari with it's oddities and Bunny Girl Senpai with it's puberty syndrome.The protaginists, Araragi and Sakuta both help a bunch of girls solve their problems with their oddities/puberty syndrome.The main girls, Senjougahara and Mai are also similar in a way. They both like to talk a lot and frequently insult the protaginist. 
Both of the main characters go around helping people with their problems. Senjougahara is also very similar to Mai.  
Romance anime where the main guy are similar and they're trying to help a group of girls because of their issues. They're set in modern world with some supernatural elements and they have a lot of interesting dialogues. 
The story telling of complex and emotional issues faced by adolescents is depicted greatly through the form of the supernatural in these two fantastic shows.These two anime shows have multiple character arcs showcasing their issues with family, self-image, greed and love represented in the supernatural tendancies or apparitions in Bakemonogatari's case. With romance, comedy and drama, these shows are both great to watch and enjoy.Coincidently they both have a slighty perverted, outcasted male protagonist with a half-harem (not really a harem, more like a group of girls who like the progtagonist not necessarily in a romantic way) of girls they gain through helping solve thier problems and come to love and care. As a result. there tends to be some romance in the shows and some heart-warming and wretching moments too. You'll come to find you'll love the charaters for their well developed personalities and characters (some more than others) and there tends to be some debates on who's the best girl etc. Though I think you should watch both and decide for yourself with a diverse selection so decide from. There is A LOT more fan service in Bakemonogatari, so try and watch it in private and after you have matured your taste and experience in anime. It is not the best thing to watch early in your anime career, so if you can hold off for a little and come back for maximum enjoyment. To add on top, I think these anime shows have great opening and ending songs that you could vibe to anytime.Thank you for reading my review, and I hope you come to enjoy Bakemonogatari or Bunny girl senpai! read more 
both stories are about a guy helping out different girls experiencing supernatural things, both are also kind of a harem (not really tho) 
early relationship, same type of convos between the mc and main girl 
It's less complicated with less talk about philosophy and different concepts. So if you liked the part of the slice of life part of Monogatari Series where the MC helps random girls because of some weird cause, Bunny Girl Senpai is that except not as good. They are very very similar. Only change is there is a ""Puberty Syndrome"" instead of apparitions. So it's a downgrade but still an okay show. Basically if you either aren't attracted to children or do not like philosophical talk, then watch bunny girl senpai but ngl it sucks ass 
They both have many harems,They both have similar problems, Syndrome.They both great on most aspects. 
·Both animes have a perverted protagonist but is still interesting, deep and enjoyable.·Both protagonists have dealt with a supernatural event and they try to help others dealing with the supernatural.·Bunny girl senpai focuses more on Sakuta and Mai's wholesome relationshipThe monogatari series has a less of a focus between Araragi and Senjougahara's relationship.Bunny girl senpai is easier to watch if you are a native English speaker .Bunny girl senpai has more action and less dialogueThe monogatari series has more dialogue and less action. 
Bunny girl senpai is like the offbrand monogatari in a sense, If you dont mind a couple of ecchi scenes bakemonogatari is one of the most well written storys I have ever watched. The source material is really fuckin good too. 
Both are dialogue-based anime that show a guy and a girl trying to fix the problems of other girls. Watch Bunny Girl Senpai if you like the plot except without the unique animation or the flavor. 
Both have a lot of dialogue, both have phenomenon things happening. and have romance 
Both male MCs are helpful, female MCS are tsunderes, male MCs helping a lot of girls with supernatural issues encountered by them. 
Everyone has talked about how similar these two are, so I'm going to talk about what makes them different. People are under the impression that Bunny Girl Senpai is a downgrade to Bakemonogatari, but I think that it has its own uniqueness.The stories of Bunny Girl Senpai is on a lot smaller of a scale compared to the Monogatari series, but I think that is good in its own way. The simpler storyline makes the idea of ""trapped in your own individual world"" a lot more significant.Perfect transition, btw, to the next subject of the ""self"". Bunny Girl Senpai deals with the individual's egoistic individual problems without regards to the outside world. While Monogatari does this in small ways like making background characters vague, Bunny Girl Senpai does this very blatantly such as making our protagonist a loner who, despite having friends, definitely is lonely.Another thing Bunny Girl Senpai has that Monogatari doesn't have is a very scientific outlook on things. The whole selling point of the series, the so called ""Adolescence Syndrome"" is a scientific phenomena related deeply to Quantum Physics. This gives the show a sort of realism that Monogatari lacks.In the end, despite being very similar, these are two extremely different stories, so don't go thinking that you need only watch Monogatari. These two can be enjoyed for very different reasons read more 
Both anime are harem-ishhaving incest baitboth mc are seem to be lonely while araragi having better emotionboth anime having a girls with supernatural disorder if bakemonogatari is related to animal,aobuta had psyhics and quantumboth mc are always related to yourself(while actually no LMAO) 
Similar shows overall but both are unique in their own way that you probably won't feel like you're watching a ripoff when you watch the otherSimilarities;- People affected by supernatural events- Antisocial main protagonists, both are pervy- Mostly female characters- Awesome main girls (hitagi and mai)Differences;- Bakemonogatari's story is more episodic, or even too disjointed compared to Seishun Buta Yarou. Bakemonogatari is also a lot funnier and confusing- if verbally descriptive- while Seishun Buta Yarou is more focused and serious, though not in a good or bad way. Kind of depends on your taste. oh and monogatari series is much longer, like 90 episodes and 3 movies long read more 
A hero who often says funny words.A  heroine who is mature and beautiful.Several girls who are in trouble.Some supernatural phenomena. 
Both protagonists are pervertsBunny girl senpai is exactly like bakmonogatari with a few changes so its not obvious  "
5081,6594,26,"Both anime have great stories and artwork. But the best part about it is the way the stories are told. Both anime have kinda the same level of comedy and are both amazing watches. It wasn't until recently that I found out that the author was the same person but I would make the recommendation regardless. 
Katanagatari reminds you of Bakemonogatari in many ways, it has the same use of camera angles and the hectic dialogs. And offers pretty much the same characters in a different setting (Boy meets Girl). Both shows are also based on light novels written by the same author, Nisio Isin. 
Plenty of dialog and witty jokes and remarks here and there. Level of humor used in both shows are quite similar, including the casual use of some innuendo to brighten the mood. Artwork and visuals are superb in both. 
Both are from the same author and as expected, characters are developed nicely with a quirky sense of humour. Both are animes featuring surrealist drawing style, little actual plot, curious characters, and random discussions about life the universe and everyting. 
Both are adaptations of light novels written by Isin Nisio, and both are extremely heavy on dialogue. The style of humour employed in both Bakemono and Katana is very similar, so if you like one you're sure to enjoy the other. Also, though Bakemonogatari and Katanagatari seem like the typical harem and shonen series,both quickly break the confines of their respective genres. 
To begin with, both animes are great and of high quality. They were both also made by Nisio isin. They both have a lot of similar core features, such as, romance and humor, while also being able to offer up a serious yet basic plot. They are both episodic while katanagatari is longer at 50 minute episodes. I highly recommend watching one if  you have seen the other! 
Both series has a similar animation style that incorporates the usage of heavy dialogue usage by the main characters. The light novels are also written by the same author (Nisio Isin) hence reflects upon a similar style of story telling.Both series' humor is presented very well and considered entertaining and amusing with the dialogue, action, drama, and interactions between the main protagonists with other characters.Both series features some supernatural themes and later on some romance.  
Written by the same author. Each show is filled with entertaining dialogue and character interactions are a central focus. 
Both from same author, both have great art and story with good amount of comedy and action mixed and both have great characters. 
Similar in their very odd style of storytelling and art. 
Watch these if you like anime which consist of mainly comedic conversations in between key events. I enjoyed both of these anime because they were almost like reading books but with action sequences here-and-there. Also, both have very unique art styles, so even if you don't like long, funny dialogues, it's worth the experience. 
Both are very good anime.Both are the work of Nisio Isin.Both are very heavy on dialogue. (Although there is a bit more action in Katanagatari)Lastly, they have -gatari at the end 
Both have atypical arts are based upon short stories. In both case the narration or the writing of the story are quite similar since they are relying a lot on banter.Katanagatari is a bit more accessible because it contains more action scenes and a bit less dialogues. 
If you like the incredibly dialogue heavy narrative that the monogatari series has, Katanagatari offers a similar narrative with each episode feeling well fleshed out and juicy. Also same author, so great characters. 
Katanagatari and Bakemonogatari are both written by NisiOisinBoth the Heroines are similar, they have a similar personality and they are both Tsunderes. The 2 shows have some heavy dialogue. If you have seen Bakemonogatari, you know what I'm talking about. You may remember the few action scenes from Bakemonogatari. Katanagatari also has short, bloody action scenes. You will love Katanagatari if you like Bakemonogatari! 
Main reason why these shows are similar comes from the fact that source materials for them were written by same author. This means you can expect a lot of dialogues with action from time to time. 
Both animes have the same author, they have the same person for artwork and the setting is similar in both anime boy met with a girl then they are doing differend kind of things.  
Both written by the same person. The story in Katanagatari and Bakemonogatari are dialogue drive, meaning there are many words to be said and not much else. Both boast great, unique art styles, and if you like one, you will surely like the other. 
Both are written by Nishio Ishin and as a result have-exceptionally strong dialogue-interesting charactersBoth are animated by shaft and thus-Have their signature direction style-is secretly quite dark (though not so secretly in Katangatari)-make effective uer of fan service without making it the primary function of the anime 
Awesome dialoges by Nisio Isin await you. If you loved either of anime mentioned, you'll definitely like the other one. The series even have similar names. 
Both anime are mainly driven by their dialogues and chemistry between characters, as they´re both originally written by Nisio Isin. Their artstyles are similar and are creatively used throughout their story. 
For starters both are adaptations of novels by NisioIsin and hence share a similar structure of story and sense of character and humour. Both anime have a large focus on the style of storytelling and tend to spend most of their time on the dialogue between the characters. The humour of both tends to be directed by the sheer bluntness of the characters; as they act odd or indifferent to common or usual situations.As I see the Monogatari Series as a hit or miss for most people, I would like to add that while Katanagatari has many similarities to the Monogatari series in terms of writing and style. Overall, it does have a different tone and it is possible to dislike one and love the other. However, if you're one for NisioIsin style of writing, humour and sense of character than without a doubt you'll love both anime. read more 
Both anime are astounding in the same way, heavy but interesting dialogue, a long long time spent on character emotions and development and when a fight finally rolls around it feels very satisfying. All and all both are amazing and come from the same author.Also the  ""-tari"" at the end of the name. 
Katanagatari reminds you of Bakemonogatari in many ways, both have a heavy dialogues and the same style of humour, also they are from the same creator ''Nisio Isin'' 
Same creator. Both shows have romance and filled with copious amounts of dialogue. 
If you like the philosophy and style of nisioisin you will love katanagatari as you loved bakemonogatari "
5081,7785,20,"Both are series that aren't necessarily parodies or strict satire. The Tatami Galaxy takes on an extremely mysterious and reflecting tale of ""possibilities"". Bakemonogatari mixes some mild to heavy predicaments with supernatural folklore to help enhance/clarify the significance of said issues.Both have strange, eclectic, abstract art that will undoubtedly impress those with it's usage. Both have and make use of some fine music, but... are paled in comparison to their OPs and ENDs.Both are quite new,  and both set the bar for enjoyment too, as the dialogue and insightful observations will cease to amaze.The Tatami Galaxy's novelty, manner of storytelling, and overlaying mystery is SOO fresh, so enticing, and SOOOOO rewarding that one cannot label it any other name except ""classic"".Of course, one needs to see a few anime ""brain tickles"" first. But, it should work well either way.Bakemonogatari's atmosphere is supplemented with standard anime fare, which will sit well with others, but might dampen the blow on some of the content the show has. Still, it's characters' are a bit more colorful than Tatami's, yet the topic's mixture with supernatural isn't so well done on some occasions. The ending also won't please some. read more 
100% more monologue at 3 times the speed.If you thought you were good with keeping up with Koyomi's monologue in Monogatari, then you need to retest those speed reading skills with The Tatami Galaxy. If you can do that, you'll enjoy it. 
Both have a unique art style and presentation, with emotional tension between the characters. There is an obvious romantic pairing in both series. Both focus on characters and presentation over any other element.  
It seems that we don't see series like these two nowadays but these two anime are highly recommended as they have a cleaver usage of characters, art, and witty dialogue.Both series contains a lot of parody, humor, drama, and among other things. These two series will definitely bring out the enjoyment out of viewers despite its low volume of episodes. Both series are also intelligent and will present anime in its finest form, one that you'll remember for a very long time. 
Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei and Bakemonogatari follow the same basic structure - boy meets girl followed by endless dialogue and surrealistic artstyle. If you enjoyed one, it's safe to say you'll enjoy the other.Bakemonogatari expands upon the fantasy setting, and adds a bucketload of fanservice. In contrast, Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei ups the slice-of-life and about 1000x the words/minute ratio. However, both hold the same charm - or curse - that makes you either love or hate the anime. 
They may be entirely different things , but both provides fast-paced dialogues and sometimes conversation goes really deep. Both focuses on characters more than story itself and have really unique art style.Also both has some mystery in it and romance. 
Interesting Art, Quirky characters, dialogue heavy.  
Happening in relatively small setting yet packed with unusual situations, full of monologuing and dialogues, experimental animation and colorful imaginery. Driven by interractions between characters.  
Both have unique art styles, fast dialogue, and a bit of supernatural. 
A lot of dialouge with extremely difficult to comprehense/dark plot line which will be explained with added romance to the same. Both are succesfully deep. They have different art styles which are actually great with that supernatural and mystery genre which you will love. 
Both share a fast dialogue, which, at times, becomes pretty hard to follow. 
Both works nicely showcases the psychology and comedy genres.Both works have an artsy presentation that fits with their respective narratives and still looks charming even today.Both works include a collection of unique and well crafted narratives that are part of one big picture.Both works contain a cast of colourful characters that all have their own sense of humour and always have a grand story to show and tell. If any one of these characters were removed or never existed, neither these two works will ever be the same (if not, feel awfully incomplete). That’s a given.Both works are very strong on the dialogue department (both length and depth). So a good dose of patience and investment is required, though you’ll be greatly rewarded once your all set. read more 
The Tatami Galaxy, as well as Monogatari, utilize unorthodox and unconventional art and ideas in similar ways to create a show, that is centered around its characters and dialogues between them, with darker themes, as well as slight comedy. 
Both are mind-bending, surreal and artistic that could either make you confuse or be awed.. Both are great anime in terms of story telling. 
Both have a similar plot in the sense of using a daily plot and take it to the next level with a solid narrative, good characters, tie threads excellently, have an excellent artistic direction in the sense of immersion and aesthetics, and load with a strong symbolism and message to whoever sees it. If you like Monogatari it is very likely that you like The Tatami Galaxy. 
Both stories are related to spirit. Lots of dialogue in both, reaaaally fast dialogue, and half of it is philosophical/spiritual/interesting, and half is just total random funny bullcrap. 
Supremely unique art styles and presentation. Equally absurdist. 
Both are anime involving a male character who makes monologues about what is going on in the world around them, whether their world is normal or not.Both also have similar story-telling techniques, with most of the anime consisting of heavy dialogue and strange cuts, angles, with meta, surreal and ""out-there"" humour sprinkled in.The art-styles are both unique from some anime out there which separate them in their unique qualities from other anime.Funny and unique, I think fans of Bakemonogatari would enjoy The Tatami Galaxy as well. 
Both are surreal,aesthethic and abstract. 
If your a Monogatari Fan, then you will love this show. It gives me the feeling ""so similar yet different"". They are so similar the bizarreness, the weirdness, and the comedy they are almost likely similar. I reccommend you to watch it. There is always dangling in front of you, destiny to be exact so why not reach out and grab this anime? "
5081,2246,11,"Series of short story arcs centred upon supernatural entities (Aberrations in Bakemonogatari and Mononoke in Mononoke) taking form and haunting characters. While Mononoke focuses more on the stories and Bakemonogatari on the characters, they structure their short arcs very similarly, both narrative-wise and progression. Both series share this style of storytelling presented with a unique style of animation: Bakemonogatari is more Shaft than the average Shaft, and Mononoke takes upon itself a very ""Japanese"" style to fit their respective settings. 
Both series centre around sequential arcs in which the protagonist tackles a supernatural entity plaguing humans by unravelling the circumstances surrounding it. Bakemonogatari has a modern setting while Mononoke is a period piece, so they complement each other with the contrast. 
Both are arc-based stories dealing with one specific supernatural entity in each arc. The true nature of the situation is not always readily apparent at the beginning of the arc but is revealed by the end. They also both have a very distinctive visual style, though not necessarily in the same way. 
Both animes are stories about supernatural beings. Bakemonogatari is about oddities and Mononoke is about demons. Both are also made in an unothordox way regarding the animation style and art. 
both series feature the same sort of paranormal mystery aspect, though the two go about it in a different timeframe and fashion. Both feature a unique sort of artwork seen in anime, though the two aren't all too similar in that respect. 
These two anime are alike for the structure and the very basis of the show. They are both anime about the supernatural separated into arcs. While Mononoke has a better focus on the execution and the art. Bakemonogatari is more character and dialogue based. 
Two series about Japanese apparitions. They're not very similar storytelling-wise, but Mononoke's MC (the Apothecary) is quite similar to Oshino Meme, an aberration specialist from Monogatari (they even share the voice actor). If you enjoy encounters with the supernatural, both series should suit you. 
Very supernatural, mysterious, Japanese, arc-driven series.Both have psychedelic art, one of them having it as a basis for the whole anime.Paying attention is the norm for watching the two series.One thing though, while both animes have Mystery tags, Mononoke falls more into the horror genre, while the Monogatari series is focused more on romance and fanservice. 
Bakemonogatari and Mononoke are surprisingly similar. The latter is definitely more serious, with a heavy psychological focus, whereas the first has no shame in being irreverent and constantly playing around with meta-references (although it never strays into fields of shameless idiocy or exaggerated humor). Both, however, present unique storytelling and a distinctive and highly experimental (Mononoke being much more iconoclastic) audiovisual experience. Words, images, and sounds are just as important as narration in both cases. And in both cases, it never fails to be interesting.And by far the most interesting connection among them is how the arcs are focused on the characters and their inner struggles and contact with supernatural entities rather than a ""master-storyline"" that guides the entire show. read more 
Bakemonogatari and Mononoke feature unique art and direction as well as a lot of dialogue. The shows consist of a series of arcs focused on the supernatural which are well complemented by their music and style. 
they are both psychological animes with mystery and supranatural in them. "
5081,457,8,"Both of these animes are about people who deal with the interactions of otherworldy creatures and humans. The series are divided up into short segments. However, Bakemonogatari's short stories can last a few episodes long while each episode of Mushishi is seperate. Bakemonogatari is more eccentric with unique animations and a cast of very developed characters. Mushishi focuses more on nature and harmony and has only one main character.Bakemonogatari is recommended for more mature viewers. 
I get the same feeling when I watch these animes, it has similar mystical worlds and creatures that does make human life more difficult. The main characters always finds themselves helping those that are around them. It's really worth the time watching.  
Both involve oddities, although Monogatari is more about the characters and their role within the story, and Mushishi is more about the interesting and unique oddities that exist within its world. Mushishi is episodic however.  
In both series, the main character interacts with people attached to supernatural beings. 
Bakemonogatari and Mushishi have quite a few similarities.First of all the Main Characters Araragi and Ginko have a lot in common. They are trying to help other people with their problems and oddities.The show is not about the Main Characters themselves, as you do not learn a lot about their own past and story, but more about the people around them.Both shows have a mystery/supernatural side.The biggest difference between the shows is how they are presented.Mushishi is really serious and give you an experience that not a lot of shows will give you. Bakamonogatari has a fun side and it has a completely different artstyle. 
Both series talk about a main character using supernatural powers to save other people from their supernatural problems.Both anime have a dark eerie atmosphere, intriguing mystery with a historical theme.Bakemonogatari being in a high school setting, also has humour, romance and some fanservice.While Mushishi is about a lone man on the road which makes it more on the Adventure side.The art is beautiful and the voice acting is on point 
Both shows explore vague paranormal phenomenons, dealing with the most terrifying abominations possible. Both shows have a really unique creepy atmosphere, and are somewhat relaxing to watch. 
Like Mushishi, Bakemonogatari focuses on people's problems with supernatural beings i.e spirits, demons etc. In Bakemonogatari these problems get solved in similar fashion like in Mushishi by some kind of ritual or by understanding the problem to its roots.  "
5081,2966,5,"Both series are heavily dialogue and character focused.  Both have a very likable female protagonist who teases the male protagonist.   The banter between the two main characters in both shows is pretty interesting to watch.   The two series are also about different things but uses those things to bring two people together romantically.  Spice and Wolf focuses on the life of being a merchant (fundamental economic theory), and Bakemonogatari focuses on the supernatural.   Ultimately, it is the romance of the two shows that keeps things interesting.   
These two series actually have very little similarities. However, if you are looking for great dialogue, these two have it. Both are great series to soak up every word the characters have to say. If you want words and not action (well, maybe a little action) then watch these! 
Heavily dialogue focused series between the main characters. It is not an exaggeration to say that the dialogue drives the story in both anime. Fortunately, the animation during characters' exchange of words is interesting as that it shifts between different objects, adding an unique visual appeal if one grows tired of the dialogue. In the end of each arc, though, the amount of intelligent dialogue would come off as rewarding, as the story always ends in a satisfying way. 
Both anime offer witty banter between the female character and the protagonist, as well as supernatural aspects.  
Both anime are almost entirely dominated by extremely entertaining banter between the main heroine and protagonists of each show, though Bakemonogatari has multiple female protagonists each with their own personalities that bring a unique flair to the discourses (like Hitagi being the sadistic tsundere, threatening Koyomi with physical harm). Each series has an interesting, if sometimes little explored backdrop, like the supernatural lore in Monogatari, or the interesting economic schemes Lawrence and Holo find themselves wrapped up in. "
5081,4081,4,"The reason I started to compare Bakemonogatari and Natsume Yuujinchou actually is that the male main characters are both voiced by Kamiya Hiroshi. Then I started to notice that the themes and the atmosphere is quite similar. And even if the animation is different they share high production values.These shows are about high-school boys who get mixed up with supernatural creatures and phenomenon. The main characters take notice of things that normal humans cannot see and try to help out, even if it is dangerous. The arcs of the different stories are not very long but characters frequently show up again. There is an unique mixture of peacefull daily life and violent supernatural occurences. Bakemonogatari has more graphic violence, Natsume on the other hand always tells touching stories...  read more 
These stories have some interesting parallels. Both are ""boy who can see yokai/spirits"" shows taking place in the modern day, with main characters in high school who help others dealing with problems pertaining to the spiritual world, and have older, more experienced exorcist mentors. The main characters are somewhat similar despite having different appearances and are both voiced by the same Japanese seiyuu. The two mains come to terms with their place, locked between the human and spiritual word, and find happiness in that role.There are some noted differences, however. Bakemonogatari focuses primarily on helping humans who have come across dangerous yokai that are cursing or possessing them, and spirits are rarely characters in and of themselves. It's also much more action-oriented and humorous, along with having a harem aspect to it and use of quirky human characters with moe and fanservice elements. The main character also acquired his ability to see strange think later in life, and is dealing with a new skill rather than an old one.Natsume Yuujinshou is more of a Slice-of-Life, where Natsume helps out and befriends both yokai and humans, as he deals with his ability to see things that others can't. He changes from a person who was alienated and passed from family to family because of his strangeness, and the frightening things he saw as a child. He comes to value his ability as it allows him to make friends with yokai, and help them out. There's some action and humor, but it's a much more subtle and quiet series than Bakemonogatari.The two series themselves have different animation styles, Bakemonogatari's being somewhat bizarre at times, but both are short-story oriented, with Natsume Yuujinchou being completely episodic and Bakemonogatari having short arts a couple episodes long. Both are sometimes considered 'slow' or 'boring',  (though this is far from the case), because Bakemonogatari focuses so much on dialogue and characters, and Natsume has a more quiet atmosphere with only short moments of action or horror. These are both great takes on the ""guy who can see spirits"" genre. And both worthy of a look. read more

Just think of Bakemonogatari as the more violent and weirder version of Natsume Yuujinchou. Instead of Nyanko-sensei, you get one cute girl who transforms into a cat and another cute girl who's a vampire and hides in Araragi's shadow. For me personally, it was like watching an alternate universe Natsume dealing with all the youkai, only this time his ""harem"" is female and not male (laughs). Both are charming in their own way, but basically, if you're looking for something with a lot of Kamiya Hiroshi in it plus a lot of weirdness, this is it. If you're looking for the wholesomeness that is the trademark of the Natsume Yuujinchou series, there are some slivers of it throughout the Bakemonogatari series, but definitely of a lesser preportion.  read more "
5081,31933,3,"Colorful cast of high school students with supernatural abilities try to solve supernatural mystery/mysteries. Both series mix comedy and serious moments and slice of life elements with action elements. Both anime have interesting use of various color palettes and are aesthetically pleasing to the eye in general. 
Main cast of teenagers who lives in a modern japanese city. They must deal with supernatural events to help other people; using the autoconclusive chapter formula. Also, both has good comedy and drama, pretty indicate to their target; instead have childish humor and forced overacted drama, like most of shounen. 
Bakemonogatari and Jojo part 4 are really similar and not a lot of people seem to notice it for some reason. Both shows take place in bizarre towns with a lot of strange happenings and equally strange people. The protagonists befriends some of those said people in extremely well written arcs that introduces the characters in a perfect way that makes the story feel at least 10 times more complete. That and the plot of both the shows about defeating small menaces around the city makes Jojo DIU and Bakemonogatari strangely similar.  "
5081,9253,3,"Both have extremely deep and interesting characters with many sides to their personalities. Both have elements of the unreal while keeping true to a very realistic setting. Both have great endings. Both are instant classics to viewers who are somewhat experienced in watching anime. 
Both Bakemonogatari (from the Monogatari series) and Steins;Gate are dialogue heavy and have little to no fight scenes, of which, personally, I really like. This means that you have to listen and recall a lot of what the characters say to understand the story to it's full potential, but if you are willing to do that then the payoff is pretty good.Bakemonogatari has a bit more of a darker, creepy atmosphere to it compared to Steins;Gate, which has a light and normal feel to it at first and then it slowly shifts into a darker mood.Steins;Gate is about time travel/multiple universes whilst Bakemonogatari is about apparitions and vampires. They both have a main character who is unique, and kind of crazy, and they choose to help solve other peoples problems using whatever means they can. Both of these titles are in my top 3 anime series (I gave both 10/10), which shows that I enjoy dialogue a lot. So, if you enjoy good story and dialogue, then these anime are for you. read more 
Both are works that both blend seriousness and otaku-related comedy well together. Both involve the harem relationships into the plot without making it the center focus or annoying like other harem ecchi comedies.  "
5081,2251,3,"These are for people who can really enjoy an artful story. These are both quite unique anime.The only real similarities between these involve immortality, but they play into the stories in very different ways. 
This one may be a stretch, but if you like a different form of story telling, these are for you. Baccano and Bakemonogatari feature several stories on different characters and make everything connect as it proceeds through the story. 
Immortality plays a prominent role in both series, albeit shown though their own methods. While the two are very different kinds of shows, neither tell their stories in traditional manner. Instead they are disjointed and fragmented, but done in a way that actively encourages the viewer to piece it all together. "
5081,918,2,"Although Gintama may seem totally different from Bakemonogatari, I think they both have an intelligent aspect to them. If you like the drawn out dialogue of Bakemonogatari, I think you'll like Gintama. Bakemonogatari progresses its plot very slowly and Gintama progresses its plot(if there is a plot) very slowly also. They both focus on the characters rather than the environment and the story surrounding the characters. Bakemonogatari has other things similar to Gintama such as 2-4 episode arcs, humorous and occasionally emotional dialogue, and unique characters. If these things appeal to you in Bakemonogatari, I think Gintama is for you.  
Not that similar in any way. But if you're into 4th wall breaking in Anime,you should definitely check these out. I would have recommended the entire Monogatari series if I had the option, but, oh, well.  "

5081,11061,2,"With a great focus on characters who are written purposefully and uniquely, given captivating character arcs. Much like HxH, the Monogatari series challenges the viewer intellectually, and defy the norm of the medium in structure. 
Note: I'm recommending Monogatari series as a whole and not only Bakemonogatari.Both series aren't one-sided stories and are divided into multiple arcs in the entire series due to a dissimilar reasons but has one reason in common, wide cast of important characters with some obstacles or goals as the series portrayed.Both series are monologue-heavy. This is not 100% guaranteed but both series had a very engaging 3 dimensional characters that you might get attached to, I personally got attached to them so.Both series are quite philosophical too, way close to realism. "
5081,37999,2,"This is a recommendation to Monogatari series in general. Both Kaguya-sama and Monogatari series heavily uses narration in their story telling, and is done well. Both anime are also presented in a pretty unique style, giving a new kind of experience in this medium. The difference is Kaguya-sama is more episodic, while Monogatari series have an overarching plot. 
Both suprisingly had a very nice slick art that your eyes will enjoy "
6594,5081,26,"Both anime have great stories and artwork. But the best part about it is the way the stories are told. Both anime have kinda the same level of comedy and are both amazing watches. It wasn't until recently that I found out that the author was the same person but I would make the recommendation regardless. 
Katanagatari reminds you of Bakemonogatari in many ways, it has the same use of camera angles and the hectic dialogs. And offers pretty much the same characters in a different setting (Boy meets Girl). Both shows are also based on light novels written by the same author, Nisio Isin. 
Plenty of dialog and witty jokes and remarks here and there. Level of humor used in both shows are quite similar, including the casual use of some innuendo to brighten the mood. Artwork and visuals are superb in both. 
Both are from the same author and as expected, characters are developed nicely with a quirky sense of humour. Both are animes featuring surrealist drawing style, little actual plot, curious characters, and random discussions about life the universe and everyting. 
Both are adaptations of light novels written by Isin Nisio, and both are extremely heavy on dialogue. The style of humour employed in both Bakemono and Katana is very similar, so if you like one you're sure to enjoy the other. Also, though Bakemonogatari and Katanagatari seem like the typical harem and shonen series,both quickly break the confines of their respective genres. 
To begin with, both animes are great and of high quality. They were both also made by Nisio isin. They both have a lot of similar core features, such as, romance and humor, while also being able to offer up a serious yet basic plot. They are both episodic while katanagatari is longer at 50 minute episodes. I highly recommend watching one if  you have seen the other! 
Both series has a similar animation style that incorporates the usage of heavy dialogue usage by the main characters. The light novels are also written by the same author (Nisio Isin) hence reflects upon a similar style of story telling.Both series' humor is presented very well and considered entertaining and amusing with the dialogue, action, drama, and interactions between the main protagonists with other characters.Both series features some supernatural themes and later on some romance.  
Written by the same author. Each show is filled with entertaining dialogue and character interactions are a central focus. 
Both from same author, both have great art and story with good amount of comedy and action mixed and both have great characters. 
Similar in their very odd style of storytelling and art. 
Watch these if you like anime which consist of mainly comedic conversations in between key events. I enjoyed both of these anime because they were almost like reading books but with action sequences here-and-there. Also, both have very unique art styles, so even if you don't like long, funny dialogues, it's worth the experience. 
Both are very good anime.Both are the work of Nisio Isin.Both are very heavy on dialogue. (Although there is a bit more action in Katanagatari)Lastly, they have -gatari at the end 
Both have atypical arts are based upon short stories. In both case the narration or the writing of the story are quite similar since they are relying a lot on banter.Katanagatari is a bit more accessible because it contains more action scenes and a bit less dialogues. 
If you like the incredibly dialogue heavy narrative that the monogatari series has, Katanagatari offers a similar narrative with each episode feeling well fleshed out and juicy. Also same author, so great characters. 
Katanagatari and Bakemonogatari are both written by NisiOisinBoth the Heroines are similar, they have a similar personality and they are both Tsunderes. The 2 shows have some heavy dialogue. If you have seen Bakemonogatari, you know what I'm talking about. You may remember the few action scenes from Bakemonogatari. Katanagatari also has short, bloody action scenes. You will love Katanagatari if you like Bakemonogatari! 
Main reason why these shows are similar comes from the fact that source materials for them were written by same author. This means you can expect a lot of dialogues with action from time to time. 
Both animes have the same author, they have the same person for artwork and the setting is similar in both anime boy met with a girl then they are doing differend kind of things.  
Both written by the same person. The story in Katanagatari and Bakemonogatari are dialogue drive, meaning there are many words to be said and not much else. Both boast great, unique art styles, and if you like one, you will surely like the other. 
Both are written by Nishio Ishin and as a result have-exceptionally strong dialogue-interesting charactersBoth are animated by shaft and thus-Have their signature direction style-is secretly quite dark (though not so secretly in Katangatari)-make effective uer of fan service without making it the primary function of the anime 
Awesome dialoges by Nisio Isin await you. If you loved either of anime mentioned, you'll definitely like the other one. The series even have similar names. 
Both anime are mainly driven by their dialogues and chemistry between characters, as they´re both originally written by Nisio Isin. Their artstyles are similar and are creatively used throughout their story. 
For starters both are adaptations of novels by NisioIsin and hence share a similar structure of story and sense of character and humour. Both anime have a large focus on the style of storytelling and tend to spend most of their time on the dialogue between the characters. The humour of both tends to be directed by the sheer bluntness of the characters; as they act odd or indifferent to common or usual situations.As I see the Monogatari Series as a hit or miss for most people, I would like to add that while Katanagatari has many similarities to the Monogatari series in terms of writing and style. Overall, it does have a different tone and it is possible to dislike one and love the other. However, if you're one for NisioIsin style of writing, humour and sense of character than without a doubt you'll love both anime. read more 
Both anime are astounding in the same way, heavy but interesting dialogue, a long long time spent on character emotions and development and when a fight finally rolls around it feels very satisfying. All and all both are amazing and come from the same author.Also the  ""-tari"" at the end of the name. 
Katanagatari reminds you of Bakemonogatari in many ways, both have a heavy dialogues and the same style of humour, also they are from the same creator ''Nisio Isin'' 
Same creator. Both shows have romance and filled with copious amounts of dialogue. 
If you like the philosophy and style of nisioisin you will love katanagatari as you loved bakemonogatari "
6594,2966,15,"They talk a lot and I mean A LOT in both. The chit-chat is funny, sometimes deep, and also very absorbing. Both have fantasy style setup. And of course brilliant couples :) 
There's something special about the way the two main characters grow with one another in both series that just makes you fall in love with them as a couple. So much character in each Anime's main cast too. The soundtracks are great and would be pretty entertaining to see them swapped with each other. If you want a good adventure, both of these shows are especially perfect for the craving. <3 I found both Spice and Wolf and Katanagatari left me with the same feeling of depression after I finished them too. haha 
The dialogues structure-script feel similar, as exposing facts or historical events. These are long and become tedious after a while, but there is always a catch phrase, a distintive action or a particular event in or related to the dialogue that keeps the viewer enjoying the conversation while it lasts. 
After reading 10 Spice and Wolf novels and watching the series multiple times, I believe Katanagatari to be the most similar show to Spice and Wolf even if the settings are different. They share the same aesthetic sensibilities of witty dialogue and presenting the viewer with a set of tools to solve a puzzling situation the characters get placed in. Spice and Wolf has playful banter between Holo and Lawrence and uses suspenseful economic struggles and trading dilemmas to force the viewer to also come up with a solution. Katanagatari matches the atmosphere with witty dialogue between its main characters and provides the same challenge to the viewer with battles instead of economics. Maoyu Mayuu Yusha is thought to be the closest recommendation for Spice and Wolf. But I would like to disagree on this account. The dynamic of the relationship is quite different; instead of two characters teasing each other and more subtle romantic goals, Maoyu Mayuu has two awkward characters that both seem like  high school students trying to flirt with each other and have overt romantic intent. It is not two people with different goals in mind that seemingly grow close after arguing, teasing, and laughing like inf Spice and Wolf. Instead, Maoyu presents a love at first site of two characters with the same goal but are awkwardly hesitant to advance the relationship. This show also presents economics but not in a riddling manner that requires thinking. Solutions are just flatly presented to problems whose context is not fully given. The viewer is not presented with a problem and given the ability or tools to reason a solution like in Spice and Wolf. Instead a solution just appears from the Crimson Scholar for a problem the viewer is not entirely aware even exists or to what degree. In essence, it is similar in a shallow manner that there are economics and somewhat romantic interpersonal relationships, but the dynamic of the relationship is vastly different and there is no well developed scenarios to challenge the viewer.  read more 
Both series deal with the relationship between two protagonists of the opposite sex who - more or less - meet by chance and join each other to go on an epic journey in a beautiful, somewhat medieval, fantasy setting. Their, kind of vague, purposes may differ (in Katanagatari it's some kind of treasure hunt, in Spice and Wolf it's the desire to explore the world) and while Katanagatari involves some politics and battles, whereas Spice and Wolf deals with trading and bargaining, both heavily rely on dialogues and the characters' interactions along the way, which have a lot in common as well. Both females, for instance, are cunning little creatures who not only like to tease their respective partner with cutting remarks, but also know how to manipulate the people around them, which often comes in handy for getting what they want.If you enjoyed the development of a mature romantic relationship during their journey through a fantastic world as well as the humorous dialogues, cunning and pure, and the overall well-rounded characters in one of these shows, chances are you'll enjoy the other. read more 
Katanagatari is spice and wolf - the hot wolf girl and + some actually quirky and interesting characters who most often have lots of witty banter and with some entertaining fight sequences too  
both are heavily focused on both MC's and their interactions with each other. the interactions are actually the best part, because they usually have full conversations and its nice seeing them interact and react.one is straightforward while the other is very mischievous. kinda like the whole manzai routine.both couples are travelingboth girls have mysterious pastsboth have nice ratings and are fairly popular 
Katanagatari and Spice and Wolf have similar pacing, and are both extremely dialogue-heavy, especially between the two main characters. Both have a fantasy-type setting, but Katanagatari also has some action scenes, while Spice and Wolf revolves around merchants and trading. If you enjoyed the character interaction between the characters of one of these shows, you will probably like the other as well.  
In a lot of ways, these two series reminds me of one and the other.Both series features a lot of interactions between the main male and female protagonist through their journey after their fated encounter. Speaking of which, these two series has an adventure like theme in a fantasy setting. Through their journey, they explore various places and learn new ideas as well as about one and the other.Both series' main female protagonist views herself as wise but at times becomes frustrated at various events especially regarding the main male protagonist with his actions. They also have mysterious pasts.Throughout the journey, the duo encounters other characters and conflicts but grows closer after each episode. Eventually, there is themes of romance but also at times emotions.Highly recommended for a watch~ read more 
Katanagatari and Spice And Wolf are the same kind of romance adventure anime shows. Katanagatari's plot is more samurai action based in Japan Edo period while Spice And Wolf's plot is about merchants in medieval Europe, in both series the main idea in the story is the developing relationship and romance between the two, one male, one female, main characters which is what I mainly liked about both shows. 
The stories are different, one has action and swords and battles and the other has economics and trading.However that's the only major difference I have found.They have similar setting, one in Feudal Japan, and the other in Medieval Europe, so if you're a fan of these settings here you go.They have similar journey, like the Male MC wants to accompany the Female MC on a journey to reach her desired destination. Both shows rely on dialogue and interaction between the main characters.Holo is similar to Togame in many ways; Acting smart, cunning personality and at the same time romantic.The romance is presented in both shows.Highly Recommended. read more 
Spice and Wolf and Katanagatari have different stories, however with the 2 main characters and how they interact with each other, it is actually quite similar.In both anime, the 2 main characters.

Both of these animes have two main characters female and male which travel around place to place in search of something. Of course since man and women are traveling together it's not so hard to guess that both of these animes have romance in them. The two also show how one character changes the other over their time traveling together through out their adventures overall both animes are similar but unquie in their own special ways. 
Both are series about two people traveling together and mostly focus on dialogues and relationship between them. 
Both have a main couple with a stark difference in power, who constantly tease and banter each other with witty dialog. Both include a journey trough Japan, and complex problems to solve at each station, where she actually is the smarter player. Their romance progresses at similar speed and in a similar way. Both take place in historical Japan, and have fantasy elements on top. "
6594,205,12,"Similar feeling, in both main characters have some secrets from their past,unique style of fighting and reason to travel a lot .Both take place in the past. 
Both Katanagatari and Samurai Champloo feature historical elements, while at the same time incorporate modern culture. The main characters have semi-unique methods of fighting and aid a girl on her journey to find something. They also hint on romance, Katanagatari more so than Samurai Champloo. If you liked one, I highly suggest giving the other a try. 
Similar animation style.  Slightly similar in story of a girl in need of someone to accompany her on a journey.  Both have comic relief, as well as tear-jerking episodes. 
Both series employs the theme of historical genre in the older era mixed in with modern pop culture. The stories of both of these anime(s) focuses on the journey that the main protagonist take while meeting with others. In other words, each episode reflects the different setting and circumstance the characters must endure.Of course, both series also contain swordsplay so expect action mixed in with some epic soundtracks. Both series are quite entertaining and moves away from the traditional ""save the world"" sort of theme. Finally, the setting, characters, and style of both series are similar.  
1. A journey between strangers. (Which grew deeper as the shows progress.)2. Samurai, ninja and blades.  
Both portray a reveange journey with a well-defined objective, but in my opinion everything is about the journey itself. A lot of cool samurai figths. 
Both anime are set in a historical Japan, and in both anime, skilled swordsmen are given a quest by a woman. 
Similarities between the two series:Take place in or around Edo era JapanSimilar genres: historical adventures with a touch of comedyInclude characters who travel Japan in search of ""something""Have an episodic feel while also having a climatic plotHave unique soundtracks that are unorthodox to their genresCharacters from each series have a unique fighting styleInclude an overpowered or very skillful female character Lots of swordsCharacters develop during journeySide characters that feel fleshed out even if only given one or two episodesHave characters that grew up on islands (Mugen and Shichika) (Not a spoiler this is revealed in each series first episode) 
They are similar in terms of:-Deals with great sword style techniques-Characters are both looking for something-Gives you good sword battle scenes-Unique art styles 
I mean these 2 animes are really similar to each other, because the in both series they travel together with a girl whom they protect both animes are about swords and swordsmanship  
Both are action oriented series about travelling Japan in a groupin orderto find stuff. Same concept, though with different enough premises and stories that they don't exactly feellike copies of one another. Though personally I like both, I think Katanagatari is the stronger show overall. 
Both shows have a simple story but a meaningful journey where the characters learn about themself and each other. The art and the music is similar. Sword fights are the main focus of both animes although Samurai Champloo has more fights and has better fight animation.  "

The main plot is different, however the artstyle are both incredible and hold the same kind of influence. Japanese wood prints. If you've seen Kana', you need to see Mononoke. 
Interesting art styles and full of engaging dialogue. Music that fits perfectly with the shows' tone. Mononoke and Katanagatari are both very unique and clever in terms of their execution and direction, giving a rich experience for the brain as well as the eyes and ears.

The two are especially unique regarding its art, both of which I found spectacular (subject to viewer, of course). There are plenty of interesting and lovable characters in both anime.

Among other themes though, there are characters that progresses through grown and experiences. (with a time skip) The main female character in both series are also mature and has a strong bond with her friends.

Both are thought-provoking, coming-of-age series mainly centered around one female character who are similar characters in a way that they are not physically strong but have a strong personality and clear resolve. Aside from them both being set in a fantasy world, they both have a hint of romance. Both series also contain 'beasts': touda and beast lords in Erin's case and queerats in SSY's case.I highly recommend both series. 
We see the heroine grow up in both anime as both anime use time skips.Similar treatment as we discover the world with the naive eyes of a kid, a fantasy world that seems beautiful at a first glance but which hides its"" cruelty (Shinsekai Yori however is way darker). 
The main character in both shows is a female who through the course of their childhood and early adult years they learn the harsh truths of the world they live in. The two shows have excellent world building qualities that make the world they live in so tangible. Both of the shows give off the same feel of coming of age in a world where you are expected to do things a certain way.

The two shows are not directly similar at all. But they're both very peaceful and soothing. They're also the type that appeals to the 'child' inside you  
they both have their calm atmospheric look...their art is little bit alike..both the main characters have supernatural powers...one can see spirits and one can talk to animals... 
I'm not really sure how to explain it but this anime for some reason reminded me a lot of Natsume Yuujinchou. They both tell a story in a different way to most animes and it's a nice change. The stories themselves are not similar but both animes have the same feeling I guess. I might be alone in this recommendation but I think if you enjoyed Kemono no Souja Erin you'll probably enjoy Natsume Yuujinchou.  
Kemono no Souja Erin is similar to Natsume Yuujinchou in the almost slice of life feel it gives off. The peaceful feel good moments and the sad touching moments feel somewhat similar. Erin was picked on because of her hair and Natsume was picked on because he could see youkai. If you look at the titles you can see how they are related. Beast Player Erin, she is friends with the beasts. Natsume's Book of Friends, Natsume becomes friends and enemies with various youkai through the use of the book. Both are shows you grow to love the more you watch them, please give Natsume Yuujinchou a try. read more 
Both about independent people who kind of start out as outsiders and would rather not worry others, but also are able to find people that they're able to finally open up to.Both have magnificent world building, and pay off for characters you meet early coming back later.  Both protagonists find a strange and quirky mentor who ultimately help them open up to the world and makes them a better person. Both share themes of finding yourself in a world where you're different from everyone else.  "
5420,164,2,"Both involves around a very interesting world, with lots of fantasy and with a slight touch of romance. They involve around conflicts, and both creates a grand adventure with bonds between beast and humans. 
At their cores, both Mononoke and Erin are about our relationship with nature, and both create convincing and fantastic worlds that we feel strongly connected to. It is through these worlds that we understand the various characters' motivations and points of view. Due to its format as a TV series,  Kemono no Souja Erin is able to paint a deeper emotional tone than Mononoke. And like Mononoke, Erin has a mature, engrossing story that respects its audience, never cheapens the experience with common anime tropes. Like Studio Ghibli, Nahoko Uehashi's works that have been adapted by Production IG are above trends and spiky haircuts, and successfully aspires to be more than its genre. read more "
10937,820,3,"Both Gundam Origin and LotGH deal with war and politics, and have a really similar vibe. Char and Reinhard are similar characters, as they are both tactical geniuses and have hidden agendas. Furthermore, the space battles in Gundam (episode 5) reminded me a lot of those in LotGH. 
Both Char and Reinhard are ambitious and Machiavellian characters. Both stories follow their development from precocious children to vengeful young adults and remarkable military tacticians.Of course, both stories take place in space, with large scale space battles. 
Both anime are military space operas with a large cast spanning a long time period, in which two factions of humanity fight over political differences and domination of the known universe. Both tonally resemble a dramatized history presentation, in which the political leaders, the military strategies, and the social impact of events are important story points. There are large scale battles in space and urban warfare in both, and backstories for the main characters from childhood to young adult. Both ""main main"" characters, Reinhard von Lohengramm and Casval Rem Deikun, are blonde Machiavellian prodigies and military strategists. There are many more parallels within the two large casts. The main difference is character maturity, Gundam has more shounen tropes with it's character designs. It also ist more action oriented, and has a smaller ""play ground"": in LotGH it's spanning several galaxies, in Gundam it's the solar system of Earth only. read more "

5040,1535,42,"If you've ever found yourself wondering about what would happen if Light Yagami was a pitcher in a baseball series, instead of attempting to become a God using his notebook of death, then the answer is simple: One Outs. It was made by the same studio, Madhouse, and every aspect of the show - ranging from the dull colour choice and realistic art style to internalised thought emphasis - highlight this fact. It's impossible for anyone aware of Death Note to watch One Outs without thinking 'DEATH NOTE!'. Both the series itself and the way it was adapted are just too similar. Even the vibe the opening and ending give off just screams DARK PSYCHOLOGICAL, as opposed to baseball anime.What you have to understand about One Outs is that it isn't a sports anime. Baseball, taken to absurd extremes for entertainment purposes, is just for decoration. What One Outs is is a psychological warfare series. Every pitch becomes a life-or-death mental battle. This is because, rather than just winning matches, Toua (the lead of One Outs) bets everything on not giving up even one run. By the end he has to deal with sabotage from his own team, in addition to the opposing team, due to his Light Yagami-esque genius resulting in his 'no outs' contract bonuses costing his team so much money. The series is actually more enjoyable if you don't know anything about baseball and can overlook the baseball rule absurdity.  read more 
They don't rely on action but tension and suspense created from an ensuing battle of the wits. You could say that the Pitcher is to Kira as the Batter is to L or vice versa. 
Death Note and One Outs both are the same ""type"" of show in that the approach to each episode's plot is the same: using psychology to try to outwit your opponent. 
The style of this anime makes me feel like i'm watching Light play baseball. I wasn't expecting much out of this anime at first, but it really drew me in. If you liked Death Note, you will definitely enjoy this anime. 
They don't rely on action but tension and suspense created from an ensuing battle of the wits.  
At a glance, they may not seem related. One is about baseball, the other mass murder. However, both series share a striking similarity. That is, they have excellent battles of wits and mind games. If you liked the things L did at the beginning to pinpoint Kira, or your mind was blown by the epic climaxes of Light's actions(Potato Chip scene for example), then you will probably like One Outs as well.  Just as in the first half of Death Note, the pacing is excellent, and there is loads of tension as each scenario builds to a climax. Truly an excellent series for viewers who like being surprised. read more 
The way the teams are tryin' to make a fool out of each others is quite similar to L and Light. 
One outs is similar with Death Note But One Outs is About sport. The way of figuiring out the problems from Death Note is almost the same as in One Outs but even Better 
Both of these animes tantalize your brains. you will be wowed at the ingenious plans. In These two animes that are seemingly worlds apart (shinigamis and baseball), are really as similar as two animes can get. The key ingredient is the smartness, as some typically refer to as ""brain-f***"" 
Although delivered in different circumstances, both series have psychological tendencies that shares a similar feeling and maintaining a sense of mind games between the characters.The main character in both series are intelligent, cunning, and always uses strategies to solve their conflicts. Mistakes can cost them big time but they always try to stay ahead of their adversaries.The main protagonists also has similar personalities and throughout the series demonstrates their intellect in various mind games. 
I know, that OO is a sporty type and DN is an action, but the way Tokuchi (OO) resolves problems in the game is similar to the way L does. I think OO has awesome OST, while DN has interesting plot. I think both titles shouldn't be compared, but both are worth to watch. I recommend them. 
Both shows use suspense to attract the audience. Both shows have an extremely intelligent main character.While both shows may seem very different, (gambling in baseball, and killing people) they are similar in how they attract the audience!If you liked Death Note, you will also like One Outs! 
Both have many mind games between the main character and his opponent. Both are very thrilling and fun to watch. One Outs is more on the baseball strategies side whereas Death Note focuses on crime and mystery a bit more, but both have the same feeling when you watch them and are recommended. 
In both animes the main person(s) (Yagami Light, Ryuzaki - Tokuchi) is very clever. They make you wonder about what will they do next.  
Although you wouldn't expect it, the feel of this anime is very similar.  It's full of intense psychological battles and mind games - battles of wits.   One Outs has the good qualities of death note with out the brutality.  People who liked Death Note should give One Outs a try :)Basically, imagine Light as being a less paranoid, gambling baseball pitcher. 
Different genres, but they're really similar! Both anime series are about power of intellect. You can know nothing about baseball, but you'll do justice to Toa's tricky plans!  
Two genius's's (genii?).Masters of intelligence. One in murder. One in... Baseball?Many of you found the best thing about death note was Light outsmarting people when it appeared as though he had lost.The same thing happens in One outs with the same level of intelligence from Tokuchi.In fact, in one episode  Tokuchi's inteligence in outwitting his enemies was literally jaw dropping.Some of you will be sceptical about a baseball anime.Dont be. This is Death note (in baseball).Would love to see Yagami and Tokuchi play some time. 
the main characters of both TV series are one in a billion if you are up against them its better to die rather than have a face off with them . In One Outs tokochi goes out to conquer the world of baseball meanwhile Light is on a conquest to become god of this world they face many trails but get out of them by using thier brains and nothing else 
Though of entirely different genres, both anime's protagonists engage in psychological battles with different situations they face, not to mention how similar Tokuchi seems to Light and similar art styles when their reasoning. 
Surely, One Outs is the sports version of DeathNote. Both main characters have badass brain and strategy. When you watch the first episode, I am sure you can not be helped to stop watching again and again till the final episode :D 
Despite the very different themes, (OO's story driver: baseball politics; DN's story driver: power of death) both MCs are portrayed in similar respects. Both have high aptitude for critical thinking and an arrogance to match their ""one-step ahead"" thought process. They seem to always have the answers to unsettling and problematic circumstances. They each thrive on rivalry; (a noteworthy aspect in DN, to a lesser extent for OO) 
One Outs is very similar to Death note in the fact the both could've turned out to be a classic sports and mystery respectively, but both chose the psychological route. But unlike Death Note, in One Outs it is not 2 geniuses dueling it out in a psychological game, but instead merely one man who controls all in the game like they were pawns. Both series were animated by Madhouse as well. 
One outs are the only anime like Death Note, just in sports genre.-Both anime contains genius characters.(like enourmous genius :))-Quite similair atposphere and little bit dark-Mind games between the characters.-One outs has just one minus - unfinished story, if you wat to know how the story ends, you must read the manga (it's worth it) 
-both of those series have smart main characters-The Main Characters in those series try to outsmart their opponet and play mind games-Both very psychological animethe most significant difference is that One Outs is a baseball anime while Death Note isn't a sports anime and it's darker than One Outs 
- They both are by the same production, Madhouse.- They both have characters who can manage to get out of tough situations in relative ease due to their impressive intellect. 
toukuchi toua the main character in one outs is basically light yagami playing baseball. two shows are both psychologically beating your opponent. one is killing and the other is with baseball and gambling. tokuchi kinda looks like hisoka from hunter x hunter too lol 
Both shows have intelligent protagonists, rogues and calculators, although we have some exaggerations and freaky things, both shows deliver good surprises and great strategies, the protagonists' anti-heroism gives a greater charm to both shows. 
Both animes have main characters that make very carefull decisions by always calculating the odds.Main characters of both animes are always two or even more steps ahead of their opponents.Their protagonists have always everything under control and are not afraid of the outcomes.Both animes will make you a better speculator in life. 
I got the same vibe watching One Outs as I did watching Death Note:- both MC's are calculating and extremely smart- they are relentless and will use any underhanded trick to stop their opponents- both have back and forth psychological battles that will keep you at the edge of your seat- both are very high-stakes (even One Outs, it is for millions of yen)- they are produced by the same studioKeep in mind that One Outs' psychological battles are centered around baseball though, so if you don't know the basic rules of the game, you should probably stay away. 
The two main characters are masterminds in their own ways. If you liked Death Note for it's reflections and ruses, you will love the way One Outs evolves thanks to Tokuchi's (One Outs main character) stratagems. 
Both Animes:-Have a Genius Main Character-Have the MC get into seemingly inescapable situations-Have battle of wits between two intelligent people 
Both……are psychological thrillers that deal with mind games and high stakes.…have an attractive, arrogant and super-intelligent main character.…rely on inner monologues and lengthy explanations of their complicated plans.…have amazing soundtracks and good animation.Death Note is a lot darker, as it is about life and death and the concept of justice. One Outs is an anime about baseball, but actually… it isn’t. I had no interest or a lot of knowledge in sports, especially not in baseball prior to watching One Outs, but it managed to hook me nonetheless. What little you need to know about the rules is always explained to the viewer. Death Note gets more closure and better characterizations, but One Outs is a little bit more consistent in terms of writing quality and creates exciting cliffhangers. read more 
Both are psychological thrillers, even though in very different settings, but somehow give off the same vibe. 
- Both made by studio Mad House.- Both main characters have an IQ of at least a thousand. 
Do you think that the one other show most similar to Death Note is Code Geass? If so, you're wrong. One Outs is the most similar to Death Note in terms of delivery and its protagonist that you can get while even calling it a different anime. On top of that, the pacing never slows down, there are plenty of funny moments, and it has a great group of supporting characters who don't steal the show or fade into the background; among all the works I've consumed, One Outs uses supporting characters the best for what they're supposed to do: support. And the villains are well done, too; even though they come and go, there's even some serious continuity with them between arcs that's always fun. read more 
Psychological shows with smart main characters that have to always be a step ahead of their opponents. They were both made by Madhouse, and feature somewhat similar direction styles, often using red and blue to represent each of its characters. 
Battle-of-wits psychological thrillers. Same studio. As others have said, despite sports and horror seeming far apart, these two shows feel very similar to watch; moreso than some of the other recommendations under Death Note. 
- One Outs and Death Note do have a really different plot,  however,  psychological aspect in both shows is very similar. - MC in both shows is an extremely intelligent guy that uses amazing strategy to win in every possible situation 
Battle of wits . Outsmarting your opponent is what One outs and Death note focuses on .  
Great character definition, Battle of wits.Tokuchi is way better than Light though. Death Note is entertaining and has a more intriguing story. One outs has better MC, better OP. Both are just great. 
Great main character with cunningness and inteligence  
One Outs' main character, Toua Tokuchi, is basically Light Yagami playing baseball. Both are very clever and have psychological tricks. If you liked Death Note, it's most likely to enjoy One Outs too. Unless you don't like baseball. "
5040,3002,24,"Pretty much the same aura around both of these animes.  OneOuts is about baseball gambling with alot of money on the line.  Both of them use there wits to outsmart the opponent but there is always someone with money they can try to scam... 
Same director, Same kind of psychological Seinen. Both anime are similar in a lot of way. While One outs is about baseball, what really stand out is the way he outsmart his oppenents. If you liked Kaiji, then you will most likely like One Outs. 
Both anime revolve around gambling and psychology. Both of these anime have amazing cliffhangers. 
Kaiji and One Outs focus around gambling, with a very similar presentation style and analysis. Overall, very interesting psychoanalytically and just in terms of suspense. 
Two stories where the logic is applied in different situations.Very good, either. It's worth watching. 
*Both are seinen and about games.*There's money in it.*Both psychology, strategy.*Intelligent protagonists.One Outs about baseball and Kaiji a thriller about survive but they have much in common. 
Both anime series involves the same director: Yuzo Sato. In fact, the main protagonist from both series has the same voice actor. Both series' main male protagonist has an intellectual mind and is not afraid of taking risks. Both series has a theme of gambling (with game elements)  involving psychological factors with suspense and intensity. Both series also has similar artwork as well as the way they are presented involving money. 
Both series feature intense gambling and mind-games, that will keep you on the edge of your seat.   
Kaiji and One-Outs are both similar in animation, due to both being done by Madhouse, as well as their basic concepts. Kaiji uses normal gambling and uses that as a base for psychological games, while on the other hand One Outs uses Baseball as a base for gambling which leads to psychological games. 
Both shows have a similar vibe to them, as they both are about gambling. They follow a main character that often finds himself in difficult situations, which he must solve using his own ingenuity. They have similar battles of wits and create an overall similar mood. They also have the same director. 
Although One Outs is less intense and thrilling and significantly less brutal, both animes are quite similar in the sense that they feature protagonists that use gambles and play with the minds of others to accomplish their goals. Both feature a rich, evil and unlikable antagonist who tries to mess with the protagonist.A difference though is that Kaiji is a lot less levelheaded and ""overpowered"" than Tokuchi but both are geniuses in their own respective way and come up with incredible solutions to the problems they face. If you're trying to find an anime as thrilling as GB Kaiji, One Outs may not be your best bet as has a much calmer atmosphere but if you liked Kaiji for the mindgames and outwits, you should definetly give One Outs a try!Also, both have the same voice actor which has a fitting voice for those roles. read more 
-Both are focalised in games-Both are using the psycological aspect of their games-Both have incredibly good and intelligents Main Characters-Both are going to show you how much No Game No Life is shitty 
High risk gambling by an intelligent MC. Stakes increase as the show progresses. Thriller with mind games. 
The main characters are quite the opposite to be honest . One is like a god in his show and the other in Kaiji is more human. They are all great gambling anime though with different styles 
Clearly the sports genre is merely of minor importance in One Outs. Primarily, the show's focus lies on mindgames that go on during a game. Both series feature gambling protagonists who aren't afraid to take risks when it comes to achieving their goals. While Kaiji puts the stakes higher with the MC regularly putting his life on the line, One Outs offers the same tension on the baseball ground.There's also the fact that both shows share a lot of the staff working on them. 
The central theme of both involves gambling high stakes where the protagonist makes use of psychology to outwit and overpower their opponents. One Outs differs being centered around baseball with a genius protagonist, while Kaiji is more brutal with its average protagonist and multiple different gambles. So, if your a fan of psychological anime that make use of strategy and showcase the risk revolved around gambling, then you will love both series. 
Easily the second best gambling anime, Kanji: Ultimate Survivor being the first, One Outs functions as a great alternate approach to the subgenre using a sport as a backdrop for truly intense gambling and action that just keep you on the edge. While not quite as excellent as Kaiji, it is still really truly great.  
The main character mainly uses his brain to win 
Both writers are marvelous in term of psychology and thriller..Both have a great storyBoth have little/no fan servicesBoth have marvelous quotes Both have extra manga content which wasn't adapted into animeBoth are worthy watching 
Both anime are about high stakes gambling and mind games, one is centred around sport, the other is about regular gambling (ie games like Rock Paper Scissors)Another thing they have in common is that they are incomplete :((((( 
Both stories strongly focus on the protagonist and pretty much only them, they want to win and money. They gable and use tricks to outsmart their opponents. 
Both shows center around gambling. There is a higher corporate power that influences the main character's struggles. Strategy is a major factor in the games. 
-Both have to do gambling-Both have the main character out-thinking his enemies(Plus a little luck)-Both are great shows that need more love 
They both involve gambling with a great main characterBoth characters solve their dilemmas in interesting ways that provide much entertainment. "
5040,1575,7,"Main character who outsmarts all of his foes (and allies). One Outs is basically all about strategies and interesting psychological tricks, and very entertaining for those who enjoy the 'battle of wits' aspect of Code Geass, Death Note and other similar anime. 
My recommendation is One Outs.  Now, you may be asking yourself, ""Wait. How could a baseball anime possibly be ANYTHING like Code Geass?""  The answer is simple--the main characters are both are master strategists who cannot be outwitted by their enemies. Tokuchi Toua has the same cold, meticulous and ruthless method of plotting as Lelouch, and he manages to outsmart even the most sinister of opponents.  They are antiheroes who the viewer can vastly admire.  As far as the baseball in One Outs, it's only a means of conveying Toua's talents to manipulate his opponents and predetermine how others around him will respond to a situation.  Even if you don't like baseball, if you can enjoy seeing how a strategist works out his next move, you will probably like this series--perhaps even more so if you like the premise of a master gambler.   read more 
Both protagonists are the cold calculating type, I recommend One Outs even if you hate baseball.  
This accounts both R1 and R2, This may seem like a strange recommendation to those who watched either one. Looking deeper I recommended these two because they both revolve around human psychology and how to manipulate them.I love both and what i can say is when Tokuchi(one outs protag.) is one the field the game their playing is no longer baseball it depicted more as a war. 
Both feature main characters who are rather heartless. They're calculating and gain enjoyment from making their enemies squirm as they fall under the boot of imminent defeat. They are capable of throwing away everything and anything to ensure victory, taking risky gambles in tough situations. Always under pressure from their superiors, they come across as an underdog that you can really get behind because of the entertaining methods they employ whilst overcoming opposition.  
Both MC is a good strategian. Lelouch is very similiar to Tokuchi. Just watch it and you will know... 
in a way both mc are smart like extreamly smart and are always one step ahead of there enemies "

If Hisoka decided to take up baseball instead of be a hunter, One Outs would be the result.Additionally, both shows make something appear much more interesting than it actually is (baseball for One Outs, Arm wrestling for Hunter x Hunter). "

Let me start by saying that I couldn't care less about either of the two sports portrayed in these shows; Boxing and Baseball. However, I WILL watch the hell out these two shows about these two sports. Although Ippo is more about working extremely hard to achieve your goals, learning life lessons, and getting punched in the face constantly, while One Outs is like watching a baseball chess match, all while learning obscure rules, strategies, and facts pertaining to baseball. They both have an addictive quality that caused me to sit around on my days off, feverishly watching shows about sports that I find boring. I even started doing pushups, situps, etc. while watching these shows because they have an extremely positive messages and for some reasonthey just inspire me to work harder.I'm not a huge anime fan, by a long stretch (although, my MAL list beg to differ), but I've never had cartoons impact me the way these have.

13125,13601,39,"future utopian/dystopian setting where the question is whether the sacrifices made to personal freedom are really worth the peaceful lifestyle, plus the main character must decide how to deal with the cracks in the system 
Psychological horror type anime set in a seemingly utopian future. However, that ""utopia"" turns out to be tragically flawed, and the unusually collected heroine is caught in the middle of everything wrong with her society. 
Perfect society has finally been created. Or so it seems. Is everything really as perfect as it is made to seem? 
These animes are miles apart in terms of universe and atmosphere, but they share similar themes comon to stories set in dystopian speculative futures. Also, they both feature a female lead valued for her exceptional resilience.  
We are presented a seemingly utopian society in which everyday hardships seem to be a thing of the past. Clearly, this society is far from perfect and holds some dark secrets. As the mystery unravels, the pitfalls of the supposedly perfect society are explored in frightening detail. Dystopian fiction at its finest. 
Unsettling psychological stories set in the future.  The female lead is a discontented participant in her society, but she accepts it, rather than try to change it.  Their governments/leaders keep a terrible secret, and monitor and tightly control citizens' behavior in an attempt to create a utopia.  Deviants are eliminated. 
The similarities aren't immediately apparent due to the differences in delivery, and I certainly didn't see them at first. After all, one is a cyberpunk crime show, and the other is a coming-of-age story set in a countryside village. However, as the plots unravel, the similarities become more and more apparent. Both are dystopian tales about flawed systems; both deal with the theme of removing threats before they exist, and both delve heavily into human nature and society. The main female leads are also incredibly similar due to their strength and resilience. Both are prime examples of psychological anime, and if you like one, then you're sure to like the other! read more 
A world that at first sight might seem an utopia, but turns out to be built at such a cost that it is questionable whether it is actually worth it. I would recommend both to anyone interested in dystopian stories. The main difference between the stories (apart from the world they're in) is the pacing. While Psycho Pass drops you off in the middle of the story Shinsekai Yori slowly eases you into the story and lets you grow accustomed to the world first. 
similarities:-dystopian theme-the setting seems to at first be a peaceful and good world but as the shows go on it is revieled that the worlds are built on questionable morals-art qualitydifferences:-psycho pass has more action/shinsekai yore is more calm-characters age (psychopass's characters are older)-antagonist (in psychopass, other then the dystopian society, there is also a human antagonist/in shinsekai yori the antagonist is only the dystopian society) 
Shows that present dystopian societies in the future, where moral values are suppressed in favor of maintaining peace and order within the society. The line between right and wrong is very ambiguous. Viewers may strongly sympathize with the antagonists, who may have legitimate reasons to revolt against the authority. 
Both refer to an ideal for human society, demonstrating how humans always strive to find a world that they believe best for them. The values aren't agreed upon by everyone though, and a group of protagonists' thinking break outside of the box they're being enclosed in. Very thought-provoking.  
The main character has to deal with similar issues such as injustice. She takes part in leading the nation to a better future as well. 
Both of these anime are modern representations of classic 20th-century dystopian satires: Psycho-Pass is comparable to the 1949 novel ""Nineteen Eighty-Four"" by George Orwell, and Shinsekai yori is comparable to the 1932 novel ""Brave New World"" by Aldous Huxley. As such, these stories caution humanity of the consequences of extreme and unchecked advances in science and technology. They show how the unrestricted indulgence of and reliance on the futuristic systems can negatively impact society, and even humanity itself. This includes the subsequent suffering of the individuals who desperately try to oppose/conform to said systems. 
-the responsible female protagonist has to come to terms with and enforce the Utopia/Dystopia that she resides in, in the process shaping her morales and becoming very strong and capable.-strict observation of psychological health of citizens-allusions to psychological works and conditions-lots of death and dying, and obviously tragedy as well.-and the questioning of the morality of death punishment-there was a team of five--and more similarities but I don't want to make this a spoiler.-homosexual relationships in the teamOf course, one has a brilliant twisted villain, the other has [i wont spoil it]. One is tron-like, the other is traditional/villagey.The team dynamics in each are completely different. read more

On the way some friends die, as result of the sybil system or the ethics committee covering up evidence.

Both shows settings are in a futuristic utopia where people get killed for having the potential to do harm even if they've done nothing wrong. Psycho-pass is more of law enforcement type thriller where as shinsekai yori has more of a darker mood than that. Two of my favorite shows for sure! 
They're both about future controlled societies whose maintainers have great fear that they could be destroyed by any one person. Hence, they zealously dispose of people who have any chance of causing trouble. The main character in each is thrown into a crisis, despite being inexperienced. 
Both anime are about dystopian societies that base their legal system on the risk of committing a crime and extensive information control with the intention of preventing people from learning things that could risk the order of society. In both anime, the government is shown to have reason to act the way they do, but it never really is fully justified. Finally, the weaknesses of both societies are exploited to great harm to the population. 
Both animes try to explain how the world could be with other conditions and show us how dark could be our own mind to reach the peace in society. Saki and Tsunemori (main characters) are so similar.*sorry for my bad English* 
Dystopian societies where moral is neglected by the system to protect an inhuman peace. Both stories are almost prophetic - one in Evolution and one in Cyberization. Main female leads have identical state of mind, potential, and development. Similar endings. Brilliant stories that can make you pant in shock and excitement while at the same time promoting critical thinking with credible arguments from all sides involved. 
Both anime events take place at the future, while in Shinsekai Yori it is more distant future and it has more mystery, but in Psycho-Pass it is a lot more of semi-perfect technology. Akane and Saki discover some not nice secrets about the system and learning the flaws they are making a choice if they should support the system or not. These two have very common feeling and the atmosphere. 
The similarities between those 2 shows are basically impossible to miss, hence a recommendation is obvious, especially considering the equally high quality.Personally i found Psycho-Pass´s thriller storyline to be a bit more polished and clean, while Shinsekai Yori feels far richer in imagery and symbolism. 
Both anime are about perfect societies that were formed based on chaos formed by humanity, but it seems as if the perfect society that is so highly praised has dark secrets and isn't as perfect as it seems..... 
Both series is set in the near future where their societies are corrupt. Both series have psychological genres that make you think and question the human race. 
An utopia and perfect system, which reigns the whole society and has no flaws is the setting for both series. Well, that's what you might think when you see it for the first time. Because later in the series you find out that these seeming ""perfect systems"" are actually flawed and far from being perfect. In both series, the governments keep a terrible secret from everyone. Saki and Akane, the main heroines, are taught about the flaws and have to decide how to deal with them.Even though both series are set in the future, they have a very different style (futuristic setting in Psycho-Pass/village life in Shinsekai yori).If you liked Shinsekai yori, I would definitely recommend you Psycho-Pass. read more 
Within a dystopian society, governments or some sort of stratification hierarchy can easily enforce a certain way of life among its civilians and dictate how one should behave and interact. Most importantly, determine one's purpose. Those who refuse to abide these rules are often shunned and ostracized by society, only to be cast aside and perceived as monsters. Saki and Akane are individuals who grow up and live within these societies. These female protagonists share many similar traits, and through the course of their development they begin to become aware and accepting of the harsh realities around them. However, Shinsekai Yori is more of a supernatural coming of age story that focuses on a group of friends and how their relationships change as they grow up within a flawed society. Shinsekai Yori's storytelling is somewhat nonlinear and the pieces aren't put together nicely right away. Whereas, Psycho-Pass focuses more on a single individual working for the police and her feelings towards the system. Both series does a great job of offering philosophical musings, but it is more distinguished and craftily done in Shinsekai Yori.  read more 
The societies set up within both anime try to achieve a utopia. However, trying to attain their utopia leads the people of their society to question if their peace is righteous. Questions like ""what is peace?"" and ""who are we fighting against?"" lies in wait for those trying to obtain true peace. 
 Shinsekai Yori share the same theme of an utopian future, which is revealed to be a illusion and build upon something much worse. Both Anime explore such a future, as well as the wrongdoings of humanity as a whole. 
The similarity of the premise is about utopia-dystopia. And the first thing that comes to mind when hearing back the name Psycho Pass is definitely the power of the SyBIL system. SyBIL is an ideal system that controls the substance of human beings covering all things in it to realize the perfect system of society and governance, although it is essentially impossible, that is the name utopia leads to dystopia. The ideal world is a very desirable dream, but it is almost impossible to make it happen that various laws and norms should be ignored in order to make it happen. Psycho Pas illustrates that the actual form of dystopia exists in utopia. Such concept is actually almost the same as Shinsekai Yori and even its implementation exists, but the presentation is much different. Psycho Pass reveals dystopia in the modern world while Shinsekai Yori tends to paradoxize against the modern world (conservative) read more 
while Shinsekai yori pushes more of a pure fantasy angle than the very sci-fi Psycho-pass, both are enjoyable for their equal dedication to their worldbuilding and main characters. I've always found dystopian and utopian settings fascinating, and these series go about painting a vivid and convincing picture of such settings in different ways, each raising many fundamental moral questions about what social and political freedom mean.at the core of each series are two pretty similar characters, both young women, both unusually inquisitive and levelheaded compared to their peers. in my case, the protagonists being so relatable helped draw me further into their respective worlds, though I have heard of others being a little alienated by the choice of protagonist (in some cases due to their gender, in others, their personalities)in terms of their aesthetic, the two series could barely be more different: Psycho-pass opts for a bold style of drawing faces (especially eyes) and high-contrast designs and environments, often with very dark colours; Shinsekai yori has a style that wouldn't feel out of place in a shoujo anime and is on average more colourful, but does turn to more muted palettes when it suits. both use their style and visual/auditory repetition to spectacular effect which make for beautiful, emotional and sometimes artfully jarring scenes.in summary: they're not a total match-up, but it's definitely worth watching them both if only to see how differently two very similar heroines interact with two drastically different futuristic settings. read more 
Although quite different, if you liked the vision of the future in Psycho Pass, you can enjoy Shinsekai Yori for this same reason. The two worlds are very different, but it's this particular vision of the future that I loved in these two animes. In addition, I particularly enjoyed the development of the characters in Shinsekai Yori. 
Both MCs have ability to quickly recover from stress.Both animes are set in future dystopian worlds, where people are destined to die, if they pose a threat for society. 
These two shows both have a similar feel and also have good endings even if Psycho-Pass is not a final ending—just a suitable ending. The situation in the anime is also similar with only the top people knowing everything, and the protagonist being a newcomer (a child and new to a company). 
The whole plot is like things that ppl thought it is perfect later turn to be serious issue that society should reconsider.   
Both stories take place in a future dystopian setting where the society is conformed to the ideal society when the main character becomes the one who is exposed to the flaws/corruption that is present within their society 
You'll see a familiar main character, who has an nontrivial possibilities to stay stable in such a distopian society    
Both anime have a similar world setting. Both shows are set in an utopian world which is actually a dystopia. There's a certain stress limit which can't be crossed. If anyone crosses that limit then they're considered to be harmful for the society and are to be eradicated. 
Both are dystopias, set in the future, and have similar moral dilemmas. In my opinion, Shinsekai yori is better in nearly every way, but both are worth a watch if you like morally-intriguing and dark stories/scenarios  
both happen in a utopian/dystopian future, while psycho-pass is more futuristic. both have excellent villains. "
13125,34599,24,"They both have an eerie feel to them. Shinsekai Yori is a lot darker than Made in Abyss although they both have the feeling of a hidden deep story that is unraveled as you go.Both are also coming of age stories that show the world isn't as bright as you think from first impressions.  
They both offer this ""what you think is wrong"" concept.There are way darker things going on beyond what the eye sees and both focus on children. 
Both shows have a cast of young characters who explore a new world with little knowledge of it.The atmosphere is dense and mystifying in each show.Their themes include coming-of-age and Hierarchy in nature. 
Both are very eerie stories about children in a beautiful world full of strange creatures, abilities and objects. With a dark story that has light highlights. Very similar in feel. 
Both shows feature very young protagonists who have an unusual sense of curiosity - although Shinsekai Yori is a coming of age story, which and has more of a dystopian feel. Both open up many questions for the viewer, and the characters strive to discover these secrets along the way. The settings are filled with nature over civilisation, creating a seemingly light atmosphere that has darker undertones (especially Shinsekai Yori) 
These series feature young protagonists in a setting darker than they think that is, with fantastic worldbuilding, slowly finding out answers for all the mysteries and questions that keep appearing along the way. 
Both have unique ways of telling the story and presenting the world. Even though both start nicely, and it's all bright and peaceful at the beginning, once the characters leave the surface (in Made in Abyss' case literally, in Shinsekai yori's case figuratively), and dwelve deeper and deeper, they discover how twisted and horryfing their world is.Both are eerie, have settings that aren't familiar with the viewer and their worlds are explained gradually, as the heroes of the story discover the truth. 
What makes the two anime similar is a deep story that unravels as you proceed with the series and an eerie feeling that something is not quite right with the world the protagonists are living in. While at first, both worlds seem to be bright and cheerful, the protagonists soon discover that things are a little darker than they thought. 
Both shows involve children being put in extremely difficult situations in an attempt to discover how their world truly works. Both juxtapose an atmosphere of bucolic calmness with upsetting subject matter and violence. Both give us strongly drawn characters with clear motives, weaknesses, strengths, and relationships. Both are a strange, dark take on fantasy.Both are spectacular.    
Both anime revolve around kids as they grow and mature in a fantasy world.They share similar art styles and are targeted at the same age group.Shinsekai Yori is slightly more serious and philosophical.Made in Abyss has better adventure aspects. 
Both have:- feeling of dread and constant fear of the unknown as central plot elements- main characters are naive children exploring a dangerous world- supernatural environment without generic fantasy stuff- remnants of an ancient civilization are scattered throughout current world- not afraid to explore sexuality/romance of young characters- tons of mystery and intrigue 
Both series are similar in the sense of everything is not as it seems.  
Both have main characters with high curiosity. As the story progresses, more hidden truths are found. 
Dystopian world for which the main characters are burdened with the passion of wanting to know more about their world. Both hold a psychological tension, and sense of horror that is held throughout the series. 
- Both series take place in Utopian-like worlds with very dark secrets behind them. - Creative and unusual fantasy settings. - Great music in both series.- They share a similar appeal coming from their unique art styles. 
Both have eerie atmospheres and gravitate watchers towards the mystery of a terrifyingly natural world. Both always feel complete and never feel contrived.  
Both have similar worlds with normal humans and mysterious fantasy beasts. While the humans in From the New World have telekinetic powers, the characters in Made in Abyss are normal humans who use artifacts from the Abyss to survive. Neither worlds have modern technology, instead using the unique resources available to them to achieve their goals.They both have strong, intelligent female leads who start as children, and we see them grow as the story progresses. Riko from Made in Abyss stays a 12 year old girl throughout the story but grows emotionally, whereas we actually see Saki progress from childhood through adulthood. Both stories follow honest, innocent characters through brutal hardships in an ultra-realistic way. They both focus on a small group of companions relying on each other to find deeply hidden truths. read more 
Both start out as a normal, post apocalyptic show, but something just feels off about the world. It's only until later in both series that you realize the world shown isn't quite as happy as it may appear. The weirdness is more passive in Made in Abyss, and takes more of a center stage in Shinsekai Yori. And finally, both are superb shows well worth your time. 
-Beautiful setting with great artwork on the environment.-MC is a girl who goes around with a friend and lost his previous friends-Kinda dark story.-Underrated-Cruel world surrounding naïve characters 
I thought I was having a fun adventure and then my heart got broken and now this story won't leave me and I keep thinking about the implications so long after finishing the show. 
Quite eerie, forlorn atmospheric animes, both have an interesting concept and worlds. Brilliant quality.   
Both shows are quite similar:- protagonists are children- shows how the protags grow up (mostly in maturity-sense for MIA)- seems innocent on the outside but becomes really dark afterwards- death is everywhere (plot armour is non-existent)- protagonists don't know much about the world they live in (mysterious world)- worlds are dangerous- really good soundtracks- fantastic artThese two shows are so similar you'll find interest in the other if you like one of them:)have fun 
Both shows have a lore that spanning for years about the world the characters live in.The world setting in both shows is heavily bounded by rules and restrictions by the society.While discovering many hints of the truth of the world the characters explore by breaking the rules the people must faithfully accept in the society.As the times goes by the main characters have to face undesired circumstances and overcome the negative effects by getting help from people they seek help and also giving them some help to repay their good deeds and some of them follow the main character to form a stronger team to cope with the treacherous nature.Both shows starts slow in the first few episodes in order to tell the watchers about the lore and the society the characters live in, in the later episodes the tone of the show become darker and more fast paced with some action scenes.Both shows have well animated fantasy world building that looks awesome.Both shows main selling points are coming from the unraveling of the truth and mysteries the characters explore while advancing the plot. read more 
It's also a fantasy/adventure/drama anime. However, it's less introspective and lacks the depth that Shinsekai Yori has due to its source material being a finished, planned novel. Still a great watch, but won't necessarily scratch the itch following SSY "
13125,35557,18,"Houseki no Kuni is probably what you came to Shinsekai Yori to see, but did not receive. Where the latter fails - characters, story (especially pacing), and art, the former is a preeminent example of the ""new and bizarre world, slowly unraveled by the characters, for better or for worse"" sub-sub-sub-category of shows.Land of the Lustrous is a masterclass in weaving an intricate and believable world out of the highest quality threads of art, music, and storyboarding. The art is a bold step for the up-and-coming Studio Orange, and the soundtrack by Yoshiaki Fujisawa is a beautiful accompaniment to the gorgeous visuals. Not to be missed! read more 
Both are about a cast of characters slowly unraveling unknown truths of their worlds. They both have a similar premise, where the main characters don't fully understand the worlds they live in, and most of the story focuses on this journey of discovery. They both focus not only on the main characters but the society that they live in (society being used very loosely in the case of Houseki no Kuni). 
The mystery in both series works the same way. They both give extreme thrills as the main character goes through obstacles to discover the truth. There are lots of chase scenes that remind me of each other. Not only that, both series have similar style of art and music where it's very traditional/classic and revolves around myths and stories. They are both incredible mystery/sci-fi series. 
While I was watching Houseki no Kuni, I kept thinking back to Shinsekai yori. They're both set in a unique futuristic world with a young protagonist that has to learn some dark truths about society and life. Houseki no Kuni has a little bit more comedy, but they give off a very similar feeling of loneliness. 
Set in a very distant future, after human society as we know it has perished and other living organisms have evolved or undergone significant mutations to suit the new characteristics of their environment. What remains of the current human civilization and its exploits (if anything, really) is often shrouded in mystery or even legends. The viewer’s presented with a vast, unexplored world full of mysteries which slowly unravel before our curious and (at least at the start) fairly inexperienced protagonists, as they grow stronger in both their physique and understanding of the world and as they struggle to accept many of its often unforgiving aspects.Full of touching and sometimes even heartbreaking moments, both tales amaze the viewer with their elaborate storytelling as well as their stunning landscapes and memorable music. The somewhat desolate, yet beautiful setting full of lush greenery compliments these beautiful stories with all their intricate worldbuilding and eerie secrets hidden behind their fairly innocent beginnings. The incorporation of buddhist aesthetic is also something the two have in common.  read more 
Both follow a character who lives in a unique world full of mysteries they have yet to solve. The two shows give off some similar vibes and share a few similar ideas.  
Both Series have a similar setting: They play in a time long after the present day, in the distant future, where most technological progress has been lost. Another similarity is that they both have female leads trying to discover the secrets of their world and society.There's also a lot of character development and suprises in Shinsekai Yori and Houseki no Kuni. 
They both don't know anything about their world 
Very similar settings and utopias about completely new societies in the future. They have a similar atmosphere as well and both contain more depth and mysteries behind their utopian facade.  
Both series take place in a dystopian world in which the world has not necessarily advanced technologically. They have a similar setup in the fact that you learn about these societies and the dark secrets that they hide. 
Both shows follow similar concepts, with strange beings who are initially considered to be evil/the enemy shrouding the truth behind their existence, which the MC begins to discover as the story progresses  
Both take place in the distant future, in a society that has changed dramatically with time, and slowly build on that foundation to tell the story of how the world came to be via fantastic world-building, and coming to terms with living in that world. 
Shinsekai Yori and Houseki no Kuni both thrust the viewer into a mysterious and unknown world, slowly unveiling it's secrets through the experiences of the characters. There is a strong presence of philosophical exploration in both shows, each of which blends this seamlessly into their story and characters. This provides a rich and fulfilling experience where the deeper meanings and messages feel like part of the shows rather than the events being merely vessels to impart morals and ideologies.  
Both series feature an enthralling and mysterious world where a catastrophic event occurred sometime in the past. Both have settings that are not all as they seem at first glance. Both feature strong protagonists that grow over the course of the story as they work to uncover the mysteries of their world. Both have characters with seemingly superhuman abilities. If you enjoyed one, you will most likely enjoy the other due to the numerous similarities. 
Both shows make you ask questions about humanity and existence in general. Both shows are absolute masterpieces. 
The plot and scenery are reminiscent of each other, in a distant future where humans have drastically changed. They're both good, character driven stories that have a very similar vibe, and I enjoyed them both in a similar way. 
-Female protagonist ( yes I prefer phos as a female )-Both got a mysterious world atmosphere-Both protagonist maturity depends on what they had experienced-A hidden plot/story which unfolds in each episode-Both anime got two different species which protagonist trying to understand 
Both protagonists live in a distant future of human society and learn more about the truth of their worlds as the story progresses, not only that but from beginning to end both protagonists drastically change from who they were at the beginning of the story. In short, the mystery presented in both of these shows is very similar, and there's significant character development in each. "
13125,37779,14,"Both are truly impressive and thought provoking. Unusual characters, unusual plot, unexpected plot twists. Similar setting, very similar atmosphere. Happy childhood, which turns out to be only a facade, behind which lies a terrible truth. 
The first episode gives the same impression, innocent children in happy peaceful world with boundaries not to be crossed, just to discover that their lives are not as dreamy as they thought. 
Similar type of horror, mystery and dystopian setting masked as a utopia. 
Both anime's feature very well written characters going through adolescence, and use supernatural themes/elements to further express their narratives. Both being done by A-1 Pictures/Clover Works, they both share many aesthetic similarities like art style, soundtrack, and emotional tones. Both shows greatly share all of the similarities previously mentioned; the shows showcase the growth of its characters, as well as express their emotions, by being combated by other worldly occurrences at young ages. Being able to convey emotion through characters is a main aspect of both shows, and something A-1 pictures has done for years. 
Similarities:* AMAZING way horror and thriller is executed in an anime. Honestly, horror does not really go well with anime all the time, but these two are exceptions!* Interesting mind games of outwitting opponents* Dark twist compared to the preface 
The atmosphere these two anime give of is very similar. At first you get to see happy children playing around until the darkness hits you and it turns into a thrilling mystery with supernatural horror elements. Both are about the children finding out the truth of the world they are living in. 
The premise: at a first glance, both worlds seem perfect, when they are, in fact, wicked.Both of the illusions are being protected by the adults (which after a while offer the kids a collaboration treatry).After finding out the truth of the worlds they live in, the children face lots of life & death challenges. The series also illustrates the psychological growth of its characters. 
Both set in a dystopian fantasy. Both revolve around children finding out secrets about their society. 
Children community, surrounded by mysteries and a forbidden-to-cross barrier. 
Both shows involve a group of children who cross boundaries they were never meant to cross, which leads them to learn about the true reality behind their world 
Both are coming of age stories set in the future. The young protagonists of both shows learn that the world they know isn't all to it and the outside world is dark and dangerous. Both shows start off shrouded in mystery and cheery but become pretty dark and complicated later on. Both shows are very exciting and are very good shows. If you like either of them, I highly recommend trying out the other as they are pretty similar! 
Same eerie vibe; similar premise; world-building is 10/10; characters fit well with the theme of the story. 
Both anime have good start with happiness but later on things just went south after they discovered something. 
Both have a dystopian society with disappearing children and mysteries to uncover. The more the anime progresses, the more we get an insight into what is actually happening.

For both series (based off of novels), they take place in a fantasy world where there is magical creatures. Among other themes though, there are characters that progresses through grown and experiences. (with a time skip) The main female character in both series are also mature and has a strong bond with her friends. They also befriend others throughout the series and learns more about the world around them as well as themselves. In essence, they follow a journey of youth & growth from childhood to adolescence.There is also emotions that are spawned from events that are either moody, happy or tragic. Both series also has a little mystery regarding the origins of some of the creatures. Both series also features a noticeable soundtrack that gives off a mystical feeling.  read more 
Those animes follow the life of serious heroines. As both grow up, they learn more about the fantastic creatures that are present in their world. For that matter, each anime separates itself in three parts : one for childhood, one for adolescence and one for adulthood. By the end of both series, the story takes a political turn and things get serious. Also, both feature school, war and love, though Shinsekai Yori may be more centered around those aspects than Kemono no Souja Erin.Both have a unique art style and a story that is  heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time. Although Shinsekai Yori is more action-centered than Kemono no Souja Erin, I'm sure that if you like one you'll like the other.  read more 
We follow the evolution of psychological behavior of a girl / woman, we learn to see it grow, soufrire, live and love over time.Both works are originals and allows us imertion turns into an adventure and a life lesson. 
Both are thought-provoking, coming-of-age series mainly centered around one female character who are similar characters in a way that they are not physically strong but have a strong personality and clear resolve. Aside from them both being set in a fantasy world, they both have a hint of romance. Both series also contain 'beasts': touda and beast lords in Erin's case and queerats in SSY's case.I highly recommend both series. 
We see the heroine grow up in both anime as both anime use time skips.Similar treatment as we discover the world with the naive eyes of a kid, a fantasy world that seems beautiful at a first glance but which hides its"" cruelty (Shinsekai Yori however is way darker). 
The main character in both shows is a female who through the course of their childhood and early adult years they learn the harsh truths of the world they live in. The two shows have excellent world building qualities that make the world they live in so tangible. Both of the shows give off the same feel of coming of age in a world where you are expected to do things a certain way. The art styles of the two shows are also unique compared to other shows I've seen. Honestly, these are two of my favorite shows I've ever seen so I definitely recommend these since they are similar yet different to each other. read more 
This has a very similar feel in the sense that there is a mystery going on in the world, but you get to watch the characters develop over many years, and it's not unpleasant at all, it's actually very nice. 
with both anime have a main female protagonist; they both time hop to various points in the characters' lives as the story progresses; they both have a slow and subtle build up to the climax and though both anime have some action, they do not rely on it to tell the story; they both entertain a very unique and captivative setting... all in all if you like one you will definatly like the other

Same studio but in many ways a mirror of Erased. Compelling characters and a story that will have you hanging on to your seat.   
In Shinsekai Yori, the protagonist discovers the world she lives in and fought for her people when faced with calamityIn Boku dake ga inai machi, the protagonist seeks to solve the mystery of the serial kidnappings and tries to save victims by going back in timeBoth are extraordinarily intriguing and share similar atmosphereThese two are rare masterpieces and have original story on top of good illustrations and well used BGMShinsekai Yori fans, a similar masterpiece is finally out!! 
Both anime done by A-1 Pictures feature supernatural powers and a cast of adolescent children. Both are a mystery anime of sort where the characters tries to figure out the culprit. In both anime, students disappear from their academy and the MC tries to figure out why. Both have their own psychological elements and have appealing art styles. 
psychological, supernatural, A-1 Pictures.they have the same feel. 
Both shows have a similar atmosphere and are intriguing. They are made by the same studio and feature a similar artstyle. Both shows are rather dramatic and involve mature themes/issues. Shinsekai Yori is not for everyone, but is very unique and BokuMachi is faster paced and has a wider appeal, but both shows are really something special. 
- The story is thorough and planned, and also quite creepy, in both shows. - Even though the stories are different, they give off a similar impression. - And both are brilliant. "
13125,457,5,"This may seem like an odd recommendation at first glance, but it's not completely without reason - both invite contemplation on moral issues, the characters, and the mystical world they're set in without making any judgment, welcoming the viewer to either make their own or simply accede that there is no clear right or wrong. Shinsekai Yori is much more dramatic and epic, presenting a world that is dystopic; Mushishi is subdued and calming, presenting a world that is filled with muted wonder, if at times melancholic. 
Something about the eerie, mysterious settings remind me of each other. The Mushishi episodes are not really connected in a linear manner as Shinsekai yori is. Both have protagonists with a special power trying to figure out mysterious phenomena. 
Both shows are incredibly atmospheric. The sceneries are beautiful and calming. Both are capable of drawing you into the story with visuals alone. While the plots of the shows are completely different, both have a calming feeling to them. Best watched at night. 
Monsters and supernatural creatures are also present in Mushishi, besides belonging to the genre seinen both animes are very good stories and should be valued. 
Shinsekai yori is like an episode of Mushishi without a Ginko character and expanded to fill a full series. The characters in Shinsekai yori have to deal with a mysterious dangerous world they don't understand. The themes and atmosphere are similar between the two shows. What's different is that Shinsekai Yori has one dramatic story it wants to tell and it lacks the sense of adventure or discovery that Mushishi has. "
13125,22535,5,"Two competing factions battle for survival.  In both of these series it is humans vs some kind of perceived monstrous being.  However, soon you realize both are simply vying for survival, an instinct every creature has.  This further blurs the line between good or bad.  Although I think Shinsekai yori does an immensely better job at this than Kiseijuu does, there are parallels and in the end you wonder who is the real monster. 
The most similar thing about these two shows is the question you ask yourself after watching them, they both makes you doubt humanity.The difference is that kiseijuu is more of an action show while shinsekai is more dark mystery theme and unpredictable turns. 
A fictional form of specie with sense of reason revolts against humans, who are more superior than them, as they believe humans are ruling the world with tyranny. 
Shinsekai Yori is set in the very far future about 1000 years from now and people have psychic powers. The children think they live in a utopia until the darker nature of their society is revealed to them. I don't want to spoil you, just trust me on this one. 
These shows are both dark and emotionally heavy and intense. They both pose interesting and intense questions about what it means to be human, and do so through another species. There are significant differences though with SSY having more fantasy elements than Parasyte which is entirely scifi. SSY is also more of a slow burn (especially at the start) than the high energy parasyte.They are also my two favorite anime (SSY is my favorite and Parasyte second). "
13125,30,5,"Both series are set in the future and are very heavy. Both require you to really think about what is going, watch carefully, and will have you thinking about them long after you've finished them. If you are looking for something serious and mind boggling to watch I would definitely recommend you either of these! 
Both keep the audience ""in the dark"" for most part of the show. Giving away only bits and pieces of information for the audience to piece together and confirm as the show continues.Both have pretty dark plots. And ask some deep questions. 
They are both character driven shows that take place in a realistic future and follow child characters that learn about the harsh and dark reality of the world they live in wile the adults in charge of the situation keep trying to hid from them. 
Both are an unsettling look into the human psyche in a dystopian future.  
Similarly, this anime is dark depressing and melancholic with heavy themes of humanity, it's flaws and the perverted sense we have of what is right and wrong. Sometimes the perspective we have as humans is biased and limiting. In Shinsekai Yori the feeling of the human perspective on the world feels suffocating and this theme is explored thoroughly.  "
13125,31240,4,"These series both explore supernatural psychological themes in a way that captivate their audience. While Re:Zero is focused on a style that combines fantasy, comedy, and dark events (meant for a less mature audience), Shinsekai Yori is a more realistic version of a psychological anime portayed in a rather serious way (meant for a more mature audience). The dark themes in common to both are interesting to watch so you will probably like the other. Both are masterpieces, but for different audiences. 
Similar overall feelings. Supernatural powers involved as well as how to make good use of them, fighting tactics etc. Music that suits perfectly to the atmosphere and mastered animation with cool effects. Sometimes you'll feel as lost as the characters. Almost same approach of mystery and psychology. 
These two series have moments that can give the audience psychological shocks (in different ways). Both Shinsekai yori and Re: Zero focus on supernatural aspects and have dark themes (Shinsekai yori is a lot more darker though). These two also have heart warming moments. Besides, these two series have wonderful art, music and scenes. The world-building concept too is Awesome! 
This recomendation pretends less to the actual themes of the series, and instead the feeling of hopelessness and deperation it instills at times. If youre the type of person who can enjoy a series even tho it makes you feel uneasy and sad at times youre probaly gonna be able to appreciate both of them. "
13125,16498,4,"Both shows have the profoundly important and mightily depressing subject matter of the human race's survival hundreds of years in the future. The future civilisations in each show are very different from one another, but they both face the problem of tensions and/or conflicts between species that have come to exist since our present, not to mention further issues regarding the corruption of human governments and establishments. What's also important to mention is that both shows have an element of scientific mystery; as you watch you'll find out more and more about the new creatures that inhabit the Earth through the characters' own investigations.  
Both are anime that are set in the future where the state of humanity was worse, a distopia. 
Both anime are set in a false utopia, and as the story progresses, the protagonists learn more about the cruel secrets of their respective worlds. Plus, Shingeki no Kyojin has a similar thrilling effect to Shinsekai Yori. 
Both shows are set in an alternative timeline/world in a post-apocalyptic setting after an incident that threatens humans to near extinction. In response, dystopian societies are created that use questionable means to ensure humanity's survival. Both have dark undertones with depressing subject matter that raises moral dilemmas. If you enjoyed SnK for its psychological aspects and not as another shounen action anime, you will definitely enjoy Shinsekai Yori. "
13125,1535,4,"These shows do touch on dark themes such as power-abuse, betrayal, crimes, and deaths, giving them a mystery and psychological thriller feel, along with tragedy, so I feel they may be similar in that way. 
Both concern the morals of killing people deemed bad for society. 
Both series offer a debate on morals, death, and human nature. They both also show the effects of supernatural powers given to humanity. 
-The problem and issue that arises during the anime is always a food for thought and question to ponder.-It evokes a lot of uncomfortable and uneasy topics.- villain in both anime are similar as they both are intelligence and willingly to sacrifices other people to achieve their goal.- both anime are rather dark.- both anime question the very nature of human.- superpower is available in both anime.- Story-telling is the main attraction point for both anime .- Both anime actually worth your time to watch. "
13125,199,3,"While watching Shinsekai yori, I couldn't help but feel it gave off a very ""Spirited Away"" vibe. It has some surreal imagery and aesthetic styles you'd expect from it, and both deal with yokai or demons who were formerly human. 
Shinsekai yori has a *very* similar feel to Spirited Away, and Princess Mononoke. It very much has an epic feel that is just breathtaking and beautiful that is very similar to a Ghibli film. It is similar to Spirited Away, in that it is about the journey of children growing more mature, in a world of magical powers that they don't understand. With Princess Mononoke, it's a very similar setting, of a rural, medieval setting in Princess Mononoke, and a Post Apacolyptic/far future medieval setting in Shinsekai yori. Both have a very similar art style and epic feel, that impart deep messages.  
Both titles have a great focus on world-building.The first arc of Shinsekai Yori serves as a world-building arc and Spirited Away explores its universe through Hayao Miyazaki's imagination. However, Spirited Away is a Ghibli movie aimed for younger audiences, while Shinsekai Yori targets a more mature crowd. "
13125,21,3,"Both are funny Anime characters and VA is same for Hiroaki Hirata 
Both one piece is brotherhood and from the new world is childhood storyboth one piece enemy is Pirates enemyboth from the new world enemy is monster Rat 
I'm surprised this hasn't been recommended yet. Both are alluring and dark, taking the average person into a world of chaos, crime and justice. Both appeal to a mature audience and dabble with a bit of the super power. one piece is set in a far natural version of sea while from the new world is present day. Amazing seiyuu tomokazu sugita and hiroaki HIRATA play male leads in both. one piece' main focus is funny and Pirates while shinsekai yori is gang violence and the not so ordinary lives of three old.  "
13125,9253,3,"They both have a mysterious feel to it, with a dark atmosphere and based around supernatural events.  
This might seem like a weird recommendation but both these series have the sort of story where the protagonist stumbles onward trying different things only to realize the error of his ways and the way the world works way later in the series leading to an epic finale.These two series don't feel the same but I can't help but think that if you like one you'll like the other. The pacing is similar in that it is slow at first but picks up speed constantly untill you're glued to the screen. There are even similar elements relating to memory (where one character has memories of something the others do not and is therefor isolated). The protagonists of both shows must face an overwhelming power on their own and while they have support from their friends it is not applicable to their situation some of the time.There are some people who might be bothered by how relaxed the creators of these shows are about gender roles or whatever. In Steins;Gate there is the trappiest of traps and in Shinsekai Yori there is a boy on boy kiss - something which has horrified the communtiy to no end. If this somehow disturbs you too much to be able to enjoy good anime then I recommend Mars of Destruction. read more 
Similarities : - MCs are strong mentally, and not physically ( they usually go through psychologically stressful situations)- Focused on a group of friends - Both have some romance- Interesting reflexions about the behavior of human society after a major event (time traveling/ humans with psychic powers)Differences:- Shinsekai is darker than Steins;Gate, with less humor and a heavier atmosphere (post-apocalyptic). - Both are science fiction anime, but unlike Steins, Shinsekai has this supernatural side to it.- Art & Sound are better on SY, while S;G has a better plot.For me they're both great shows, though I can't say for sure that if you liked S;G, you'll also like SY. I mean, these shows don't have a really straightforward connection, but a kind of weird, deeper one. So its possible to like only one. I'd say about 70-80% chance for someone to like the two of them, so, give it a shot ! =D read more "

13125,32182,2,"BOTH ANIME HAVE SIMILIAR IN : 1. POWER 2. friendship 3. great plot 4. good music !!! 
""Troubled adolescents are gifted with near-omnipotent psychic powers"" is an accurate one-sentence summary of the premises of both shows, though the settings and the moral thrust could not be more different - Mob Psycho has an inspiring and uplifting core, which definitely CANNOT be said for SSY. Oh, and! While Shinsekai Yori's art style and animation aren't nearly as bonkers as MP100, for the most part, there's some really trippy moments which make it worth watching if you like inventive animation. "

They have a really different animation, story and characters. But if you really love the Psychological side of Shinsekai no Yori, then you'll really love Tatami Galaxy as well. They both are really unique anime in the genre of psychological, but still enjoyable "
13125,35760,2,"What's the truth of the world? The protagonists in both the series seek the answer to this question. The worldbuilding in these 2 series is unimaginably excellent. These 2 series take place in a world full of secrets and lies. They focus on supernatural mysteries and are deep and highly logical. There are lot of revelations that might leave you shocked. They share a similar eerie and dark atmosphere. It's interesting to see characters make deductions. SNK s3 is waaay better than its prequels. Music is exceptionally excellent. Art and background scenery is awesome. There will be interesting theories and philosophies. 
Similar plotline,An end of promised hero with the beginning of anotherA bit of politicssame shounen main character ,who received huge character development "
13125,19,2,"A very fair recommendation to make if you've seen one of them.Differences: Different settings and animation styles. Shinsekai yori has a supernatural aspect which lacks completely in Monster. The former is also more focused on a particular set of characters and their utopian society while the latter is more of a detective series and the journey of our protagonist as he unravels the mystery.Similarities: They have mature and solid stories with thought provoking themes engulfed in a very mysterious and remarkable atmosphere. They raise the question of ""who are the monsters"" and leave some aspects with questionable morality for the viewer to interpret. I also think they are very story driven which leaves some characters less developed than one might've wished for. Both very well scripted and with practically none fan service or comedy relief.For the most part they are both well paced (althought Monster could have probably been shorten) and definitely must sees for those who enjoy good mystery books. read more

Both anime have cute girl.. some similar interesting and funny plot.. and both anime talk about girls chasing their dream.. and some can't decide what they want to be.. they enjoy doing things they like and accomplish something together. The touching scene are very similar as well 
If you liked one, there's a high chance that you'll like the other. There's an even higher chance if you enjoyed either show for the following reasons: its cast, themes, comedy, and drama. When watching either show, you'll be hooked just by learning about each characters' ambitions and journeys. I personally thought that none of the characters were annoying; each one was great. You'll also find that the shows' themes are very similar -- if you were moved by one show, the other will likely move you too. Also, the comedy and drama overlapped in many ways. "
25835,329,3,"Yes, this one is a bit farfetched. But there's similar vibe in portraying something as dull as everyday work and turning it into piece of entertainment.  
An optimistic, dream-driven girl begins working a thankless job only to discover that the field is not what it seems. She then sets out to discover what makes the work so alluring to her, making new friends and having a few laughs along the way. A healthy balance of drama and comedy alongside some of the most unique careers out there.  
Despite the difference in their setting, both Shirobako and Planetes explore similar topics: starting out in a new workplace, full of new rules to learn, mistakes to make and co-workers to meet. In both anime, the focus is on everyday worklife, not large plots to save the earth from destruction. The enemies are deadlines and broken equipment, not the big bad of the week.You will follow the inexperienced lead through her experiences at the workplace, see her question her purpose in life and, finally, find fulfillment at work. "

Porter Robinson, who wrote Shelter, listed Anohana as one of his top favorite anime. It's easy to see the similarities in the two. Both are about loss and hope. Both are huge tearjerkers. A-1 studios made both, so they are definitely similar in terms of artwork. 
The amazing graphics and images are really good in both of these ""animes"" (I do not consider shelter as being only a music). Both of they are really realted to love and needing to save someone. Both can make you cry.Shelter is also related to ghost in the shell and animatrix. "

Full of alienation. Especially Rin. However, they never give up.Shelter only six minutes though, little similar to Kimi no Na wa. in terms of story. You can know if you listened both songs.Because meaning of their songs are very deep. Shelter tends to it. As you can see, Shelter is AMV which made by Official staff.Kimi no Na wa. has more detailed story. Aside from whether it's good or mediocre, I think plot of this movie is decent except some flaws.On the other hand, Shelter storytelling seems abstract, actually have a point IMO. This AMV has essence as same as Kimi no Na wa.As a result, both works are really emotional and thought-provoking about human nature. In a word, reasonable.You'll love Shelter if you're a big fan of Kimi no Na wa. or Makoto Shinkai. After watched this AMV, you'll feel happy for someone. read more

Both science's and the young genius main characters who use it, shape the world around them. Both are exhilarating series with great OST's, plots & characters. 
Remarkably similar show in feel and in concept. Just science instead of alchemy. 
-Both have a focus on creating and making things through science-Both have a similar style of slapstick comedy-Both shine some light on each and every character, so even the minor ones feel like they are part of the crew and not just add-ons 
Science rules the world in these series. Also the main protagonists have amazing hair 
There is something inspiring about full metal alchemist that's hard to explain. You want the characters to succeed and seeing the Elric brothers grow is what makes the show so endearing. Dr. Stone is a series that has that same feel and it's one of the few shows that's on par to FMA with characters and story. If you see FMA as your favourite of all time then Dr.Stone might be a close second. Hell, it might even take the top spot.

Many surprise moments and wow factors from both anime that will put you on the edge of your seat. 
Mundane made awesome. Both shows have protagonists that triumps over enemies with the help of wits and knowledge, not afraid to use unusual methods and of course are very smug about their victories. Both are original takes on the battle shounen genre. While Dr. Stone has battles done with the help of science, Shokugeki no Souma has battles done with cooking. 
Over-the top, yet still engrossing and believable in a way few other shows manage to achieve. How? Their secret lies in being faithful to real life where it really matters - science for Dr. Stone and cooking for SnS. Nerdgasms all but guaranteed! 
-Both feature similar protagonists-Both have similar exaggeration of mundane tasks like taking something out of the oven or completing an innovation-In both, the protagonist is overwhelmingly better at what they do (cooking, creating) than their companions (although this changes in later seasons of Food Wars), and they have a supporting character who they teach, alongside teaching the audience 
The way food is central in food wars, in the same way science is central in Dr. Stone. Both series feature main characters obsessed with reaching a higher level of understanding of these central elements. Much of the episodes are also spent in explaining the details behind how these central elements work, how the raw materials that construct a meal or a piece of technology function and their importance. 
Both MCs are enthusiasts, almost to and arrogant level, in what they do. For Senku it is science, and for Souma it is cooking. Both anime also use everyday activities as a theme, which isn't really done in shounen anime.

With Dr. Stone Tsukasa finds Senku a threat to his ideals of what a good world would be like, though this clash is more of a sub-genre.Death Note and Dr Stone give intelligent MCs an interesting mind battle to determine the future of the world.

Made by the same writer. Both have amazing art and some of the characters and plot are similar even though their settings are different (Psycho-Pass: sci-fi, Fate/Zero: supernatural). 
same author, incredibly deep stories, awesome action. just incredible anime 
Both series written by Gen Urobuchi, which contain dark themes of murder and death. They are both thrillers and are somewhat similar in terms of having rogue lead characters. 
Both Psycho-Pass and Fate/Zero share equally compelling main characters, who make you question your perspective; both anime also feature gory and dark atmospheres, courtesy of them sharing the same creator. 
Both are mature anime written by Gen Urobuchi. The male characters are strikingly similar from each show. Kogami and Mashikima from Psycho-Pass mirror Kiritsugu and Kirei respectively from Fate/Zero extremely well. In their respective shows, they are men who are the same at the core of what they do but their goals clash and thus so do their similar personalities.  
At the center of both anime is a rivalry between two men. Men that have never spoken to or met eachother, but know eachother better than anyone. They hate eachother, because they're similar. They hate eachother because they hate themselves. Yet they represent different ideals, nor do they truly understand eachother.Both are written by the same author, have a similar feel to them, have similar characters and most of the story takes place in various encounters across a large city. 
Both are written by Gen Urobuchi, and the enmity between Kougami Shinya and Makishima Shougo is similar to that of Emiya Kiritsugu and Kotomine Kirei, one that of similarity between both parties though they couldn't understand each other. 
After finishing seasons 1 & 2 of Fate/Zero, I noticed themes similar to Psycho-Pass:- written by the same author (Gen Urobuchi)- both have a very dark atmosphere- both have a very deep and well-written story- both feature rivalries between 2 similar men with clashing ideologies- both have a decent amount of action- both make you question the morality of certain characters' actionsAll in all, if you liked the dark atmosphere and great story of one anime, you will probably enjoy the other. "
10087,5114,6,"Set in a different world, where magic/alchemy is common. They are both fully packed with action, and are likely to leave you on the edge of your seat by the end of every episode. Whether you are looking for something with a similar plot, similar fights or something epic with that dark feel to it; Look up the other if you haven't watched it yet. 
Both are mature action series that have a great set of characters, a good plot, and amazing art. Definitely recommended for action lovers who find Bleach/Naruto/One Piece too childish. 
I can't see anyone liking one and disliking the other.Both animes feature an outstanding plot and really great characters in a world of magic. Maybe Fate Zero is a bit slower, but some conversations between characters are simply remarkable, and I think that some characters (and voice actors) simply surpass FMA ones. But FMA is longer, and it's really epic. 
Ok, this is going to be hard to explain, but first, I will and never compare brotherhood to a crap series. this series is good. Magic (Alchemy), well developed characters, world domination and survive of the fittest. Fate zero put in challenge the skills of their characters, fighting each other to achieve one goal. Same with brotherhood, where the alchemist, using their skill at their full, must uncover all the mysteries behind the ongoing events. Filled with mystery, thriller and action, these both anime wouldn't disappoint you. 
Both series involve some mystical element whether that be full on magic users or a scientific form of modification known as transmutation. These series are, in my opinion, some of the best anime ever created with beautiful animation, compelling characters (both heroes and villains), with an excellent story. If you want to just laugh or chill then these series are not for you, with so many twists & turns these anime offer insightful questions about the essence of humanity. I simply cannot recommend both of these series enough because they are required viewing for anyone who enjoys great stories.  
Both series use a non-medieval and interesting take with magic. Although, while FMA is in the 20s/30s, Zero is set in the 90s. The Battle for the Holy Grail is much like the search for the philosopher stone except that it's more of a no holds barred tournament with very few rules.Fate Zero's main difference is that it expands on the idea of kingship brought up in FMA Brotherhood and the cynical contrast to FMA's optimism. "
10087,16498,4,"Both are technical masterpieces--featuring beautifully animated fight sequences, sounds and scores. If you're looking for an amazing action series, look no further than these. Beyond the technical aspects, they are also both quite visceral in nature--raising the question of whether or not we need to abandon our humanity to defeat the enemy, and exploring the consequences of doing so. 
If epic shounen-y shows with a healthy dose of well-thought out plot, angst-driven characters, and the theme of people battling forces larger than themselves, only to discover that the biggest obstacles are actually themselves, float your boat, then current watchers of this season's mega-epic must not miss (and likely have already watched) Fate/Zero, the only Type-Moon related series to receive a superb adaptation.Toss in epic soundtracks created by two musical titans of the industry (Yuki Kajiura of .hack, Madoka, and SAO-fame, just to reference her most recent works; Hiroyuki Sawano of Sengoku Basara, Guilty Crown, and Gundam Unicorn epicness), and these two will go down as must-watches for the ages. read more

The servant to master relationship is a very big part of both shows and each express dark themes and qualities. Alucard's nature and arrogance reminded me a lot of Gilgamesh for some reason as well. Furthermore, the catholic church is a massive part of both series. The characters were all very smart, and some of the tactical plots in both shows were genius and amazingly well executed. Additionally, each show is mostly based off of a war that was detrimental to society and the endings were very similar. I don't want to spoil anything, so I won't say any more, but I will say that both shows are some that I will highly recommend, and if you like one, your sure to like the other. read more

If you're a fan of fights with strategic thinking then these two are for you. Most characters in both these anime are smart and cautious. Both anime have very good quality production. 
Both series touch on quite interesting topics. They have deep characters with whom we can be attached or hate.The most important thing is that at the time of the script, you can see that Fate / Zero is a seinen and HxH is a shounen. The second is less deep and less adult. But it can be understood since they are aimed at different audiences.It is important to emphasize the fact that Fate is a complete saga and HxH is not. "
10087,1575,4,"Both of these series involve loads of chracters making intricate plans against each other for various motivations. There is action and a supernatural element in both. Code Geass has a lot of high school age characters while Fate/Zero mostly involves adults, and there are more not-so-serious episodes in Code Geass. Code Geass has mechs while Fate/Zero has swords and sorcery. But they both have more plotting and gambits than you can count. If you like that aspect of one, you'll almost certainly like the other. 
In both anime the main character have a similar objetive, change the world. They know they can´t do it only with nice words so they are prepared to make sacrifices even if it means losing someone close they care/like/love.

Both series revolve around war and have a lot of awesome action scenes. Both contain scenes of thought-provoking dialogue that revolves around characters' different attitudes toward a subject. The characters in both series are composed of a variety of entertaining personalities. To a lesser extent, the characters in both series aren't necessarily good or evil but instead somewhere in between. Legend of the Galactic Heroes does a much better job of portraying its characters neutrally while in Fate/Zero it seems that in general everyone was leaning toward the evil side of the spectrum; they're similar in that neither follow the story of a good protagonist fighting against an evil antagonist.  read more

The plot is a bit similar (obviously cause both Anime are Type-Moon's work), the Animation (both ufotable), OST's and characters are reminding  each other. The scenery in both Anime is dark in one moment, but flashy in the other moment, it's also forcing you to think about several actions. 
They are both shows with strong narratives and themes involving badass characters, action and a dark, crude story.

You may ask how these two anime are similar to each other. The answer isn’t very obvious. Steins;Gate same as Fate/Zero is one of my favorite anime so far. Since watching both of them. I’ve came to conclusion that issues are pretty similar. Protagonist are dealing with life existential issues. They’re looking for perfect world where they can exist without worries. Main characters are seeking for the truth that isn’t evident.For who I’d like to recommend watching Fate/Zero? Of course for people who are looking for dramatic experience based on character’s psychology. But all of you should give it a whirl. "

His rivalry with Kirei is reminiscent to that of Spike vs Vicious because both rivals are the only characters who can kill them self proclaimed and in power.Characters split in factions to compete for power in Bebop's case, it is bounty hunters and F/Z's case, it is magicians.Though split in various ways and are focused, I find some F/Z's characters to be similar to Bebop's:Irisviel-JuliaSaber-FayeRider-JetWaver-Edward read more "

10087,1535,2,"Both of these shows involve a ridiculous amount of plotting and tactical gambits. They both take place in a modern day setting, but both have a supernatural element involved. Fate/Zero has a lot more major characters and different motivations whereas Death Note has a 1v1 feel, but there is a life-and-death competition in both and plenty of suspense as you wonder what the characters have up their sleeve next. 
Death Note and Fate/Zero. These two anime series had such an effect on me; I don't know where to begin. First off, both these shows had a huge impact on me and my morals. They made me think of life and the lives of others as well as the true definition of ""justice"" or if you prefer, ""hero."" Both series kept me on the edge of my seat like nothing I've seen before. They still come to mind when I make moral/everyday decisions, and they both plunge frightfully deep into the results of what we think is the right choice.Moving away from the final message of the stories, the two relate in many more ways than what I have already described. The most noticeable similarity, besides, of course, the in-depth exploration of human nature, is probably the main characters. In both shows, the main protagonist is not truly defined until the end. In addition, both the antagonist and the main protagonist are seemingly evenly matched in levels of skill and intellect and fight each other in battles of wits. They each use their resources to the fullest, and slowly figure each other out as the series progress. They counter each other's moves almost exactly, and rival each other until the end. This is seen in each show, whether it be L vs Light, or Kirei vs Kiritsugu—they each spend most of the show figuring out their opponents' next move and planning ahead for their own.Another similarity, moving back toward the moral aspect of the shows, is the whole idea of ""saving the world."" This is seen in both series, and of course really digs deep into the cause and affect of this sort of mindset. It totally explores the idea in-depth, the individual definition of the expression, and then exploits the efforts of the characters in pursuit of this ultimate goal in order to teach the viewer an important lesson. Both shows employ an extensive pursuit of this goal, and what is resorted to in order to attain this goal. They emphasize the results of the journey and the final destination of the pursuit, which is most definitely not what was originally expected or hoped for.""In any case,"" as L would say, both series are some of my all-time favorites and I highly recommend both. They are truly life-changing, and if you enjoyed one, you will most definitely like the other. read more "

Although these lessons may be a little easier to see in Kino's Journey, they're there in Mushishi, as well.  Enjoy ^_^ 
One story per episode, with each episode not having much action in but still has something special about them. 
Both of these shows focus on a traveler and the people they meet along the way. In Kino's case, she's simply a traveler with no set destination. For Ginko in Mushishi, he goes around to many different places and helps those who have been effected by 'mushi', which is also his job. They also both share the same thinking-based mature atmosphere as well, sometimes even delving deep into the way the mind works and peoples own effects on the things around them. These two rather slow, yet extremely interesting, shows are very alike and if you liked one of them you should definitely check out the other. read more 
Both animes are very philosophical. Both tell the stories of two travelers, what pushed them to travel and what happens during their journey.With each episode being an incident from their journey. 
both are very philosophical and, for the most part, bloodless. . .two highly entertaining series that are great to watch when you want to wind down for the day. . . 
Both tell the life of a traveller who don't stay for very long on the same place.Mushishi tends to the supernatural genre while Kino no tabi is just a fantasy genre. The main thing they have in common is that both have really deep stories and don't tend to the comedic spot. 
I see so many similarities, I don't know where to begin. Both Ginko and Kino are force to give up there past lives due to something happening in their early childhood, and thus travel around the world. While Kino learns about the cultures of different places in her travels, Ginko's journey is more of one to help others affected by the mushi. Either way, both have episodal storylines. Though frankly I found myself enjoying Kino's journey more, there's no way one wouldn't enjoy both in the same way. 
Bothe animes have a separate story for each episode. Both are very deep, and focus on making the audience think. Both are quite good. 
Story per episode, not much action, both about forced journey which was started because of some accident, similar beautiful animations, both almost bloodless. If you love one of them you'll love another one for sure. 
Both series are episodic, and tied together by the travels of their protagonists.  Still, they both hold together very well and have solid pacing.  The two anime also frequently have a mythological or philosophical vibe to their stories.  The main difference is that Kino has a more surreal kind of setting, while Mushishi's is more traditionally Japanese. 
Episodic, sometimes philosophical about life 
Episodic series about a perpetually travelling protagonist who moves from one locale to another and becomes involved with its denizens on a regular basis. They both have a fairly laidback pace, and the rather stoic yet softhearted nature of both protagonists begs further comparison. Although Kino focuses more on the travelling and Kino herself while Mushishi brings more attention to the mushi and patients being treated, the similarities are very hard to miss. 
Both laid back atmosphere until you get to near end of each episode leaving you to think. Both protagonists are travelers who left their formal selves as their price to where they are currently. 
Episodic anime, very cerebral, not much action but very, very entertaining. It's philosophical, poignant, and beautiful. One of the best shows I have ever watched. 
Both have a very calming feel to it and short one episode story lines and both involve traveling to different countries, but don't let that deceive you, each episode is filled with an amazing story and is concluded with an unexpected/philosophical twist that is bound to amaze you. Also the main characters are very similar in their passiveness(or sense of indifference) as well as their inability to settle down in one place. 
Both are episodic series involving a traveling protagonist that helps out the people that they come across. They both also have a very similar feeling and style to the other. 
Episodic nature with a detached main character, that functions more as a narrator or plot device, than a protagonist. 
Let me start off by saying that these two are both very excellent series in my opinion.  Kino's Journey and Mushi-shi possess a certain quality that draws you into their own world.  Kino's Journey gives the feel of being in a slightly dark fairytale, whereas Mushi-shi draws you into what seems like a world of mythology and folklore.  I strongly recommend either of these series to anyone who is interested in a story book feel to their anime. 
They both have a similar vibe of unsteady peace and they both follow the lives of people who travel far. They both focus on the observation of aspects of life (Kino's journey is more moral and mental while Mushishi is more physical and natural)They are also both very earie and inspirational. Highly suggested! 
The step up of the both animes are similar, each episode (or short arc) is it's own story and one does not need to watch them in any particular order to understand them (though I think that is the better course). The reason this is possible is because both main characters are travelers who do not take on any new companions for the duration of both series. Their histories are a mystery and little bits of both are revealed slowly in certain episodes. In addition I feel both have interesting and unique little stories for each episode that seem to have a deeper meaning and come off quite philosophic, though you don't really need to think this way in order to enjoy them. If you liked the idea, plot, characters, stories, or everything about one of these animes I am fairly sure you will love the other. read more 
Both anime's stories are episodic with each story arc usually contained to just one episode. In each anime the main character travels around to various towns and cities to observe what's going on and usually lending a helping hand to the residents. 
Both have a stand alone episode plot structure. Both have protagonists who have very good reasons for traveling. And both acquire memorable experiences wherever they go.Kino is more apethetic and distant. Ginko helps any and every. 
Both are slow-paced and profound series, with own separate story in each episode. The protagonists are also very similiar: they are not good or bad, they are just observers. 
These two anime are resembling because of putting more attention to philosophical ideas than to bright actions. 
Both shows are about travelers who go ttown to town meeting new people and solving problems or getting a new meaning in life. 
Theme of the journey, whereby the MC travels from place to place and helps people along the way; episodic; minimal background music/sounds; monotonous, expressionless MC; beautiful art (more so in Mushishi) and beautiful music (more so in Kino); general quiet, serene, & sleepy atmosphere.The only difference is Kino is more philosophical, explores the human condition, and is full of life lessons, whereas Mushishi is supernatural, explores the paranormal, and is full of mindfreaks. 
The same idea of a non-ending journey, a world and rythm like poetry. 
traveler, very unique towns, no antagonist. Mushishi and Kino no Tabi somehow taught me a side of human nature that seemingly indescribable. 
They're both episodic anime that center around someone who travels from town to town and they usually wind up helping someone through situations at each stop.  Both stories have beautiful animation and offer up ""life lessons.""  
Both animes are slow paced and thought-provoking, episodical in structure and green in look and feel, still, with some drastic shots here and there. Maybe Mushishi is more 'supernatural' whereas Kino no Tabi gets more comical. Both travelling protagonists seem to be fine with solitude, yet accompanied all the time. 
Very sad but beautiful stories that are episodic (meaning you don't have to watch in order) and the main characters are calm and level-headed.  
Both are about a journey, leading to a path of greater enlightenment. Whether it's understanding the meaning of life or just understanding oneself a little better, both tackle philosophical problems of existence and morality while trying to grasp our own place in the world. 
Both anime are about a person who travels the world. Mushishi focuses more on beautiful storytelling, whilst Kino no Tabi is more about philosophical hypothesis. 
Shows that focus their character development on a solitary wanderer instead of a full cast. The stories the wanderer encounters, however, tell us a great deal about human nature and some very interesting reflections. 
Travelling the world on your own. Exploring new locations and meeting new people (and creatures). If this sounds appealing, then these are the shows for you. They both feature solo protagonists who are travelling the world. Each encounter and location is unique and wonderful to discover, and following these journeys makes you feel as though you are truly there. These are the two best travel anime, in my opinion. If you've seen one and not the other, you will surely enjoy it. They give off similar peaceful yet eerie vibes, as most stories have multiple sides and moralities to them. There's often no correct answer, only to let nature run it's course. read more 
It is not close but this is the closest i can get.Both anime series seems to have a lesson behind every episode. 
Both are beautifully serene and go along at a soft pace. In each, though the episodes may follow an overarching theme and central characters, they are individual stories rather than part of one continuous plot-line. 
In Kino no Tabi we have a calm composed protagonist that travels the world seeing many strange and wonderful things. No matter what her feelings on a matter might be Kino never gets more involved than she has to and refuses to settle down, always traveling.Mushishi has the same sort of formula with the composed traveler protagonist. However, Ginko cannot settle down due to extrenuating circumstances, also Ginko travels as an expert on a subject and therefor keeps a proffesional distance from his subjects.The real reason someone who enjoyed Kino no Tabi would enjoy Mushishi is that you somehow experience these two shows in the same way, they both have that certain something that keeps you locked in. Also the animation is beautiful and the places interesting. read more 
Both have the main character traveling across lands with unique short stories that are highly philosophical.  
Both series are episodic and are at their core masterful examinations of culture, philosophy & human spirit. Though they have their noticeable and sometimes profound differences, where Mushi-shi has a far more supernatural sentiment that is a reflection of a cultural spiritual identity, and Kino's Journey has a far more down-to-earth approach enlightening an observation of humanities faults and attributing a very real embodiment of human nature. 
Both these marvels take the wanderer/adventure/traveler concepts to a new level. Both are modern classics but with an age-old pacing and ambiance. They showcase why this genre is the most expansive and adept at wholly encompassing all aspects of human nature. These gems are the closest I've ever come to a religious experience, they just reek of mysticism and divinity in the best possible way. 
Both are execelentes Oran series that make you think about life. 
Both of these give off the same feeling,make every episode a new story, and are part of one big adventure. Most likely, you would like one if you like the other. 
I think the ""flow"" of both anime is very similiar, slow plot with a traveler traveling finding new things 
Both shows have a similar feeling and are existential. They explore human nature and philosophical aspects of life, death, and living in general. Great life lessons can be scooped from both shows. 
Episodic tale of lone (kinda) protagonist seemingly aimlessly travelling through world and interacting with lifes of others. Both works have extremelly well crafted storytelling and even minor characters are well developed, making every story as the protagonist encounters them interesting.  
These episodic shows follow travelers and tell the stories of their encounters. Some of the tales told are remarkably similar as well: the origin of a name, the mountain's fire. The characters embody the mindset of a traveler: do not disrupt the flow. 
Mushishi and Kino no Tabi are very similar to each other in many ways. The two series protagonists, at the very least, lead similar lives. Both are travelers. Both are detached, unbiased, and unprejudiced. Both also seem content to observe their world rather than preach to it. More broadly, both series use episodic plots to tell fables that are both thought provoking and emotionally resonant. 
Similarities:- rather episodic nature with minimal backround story development- great sense of adventure and mystery of the world- atmospheric- rather stoic, capable main characterDifferences:- In Mushishi the MC is there to help the people while Kino is more of an observer and rarely intervenes- Mushishi's short stories feature character interaction with great detail while Kino no Tabi is rather minimalistic and puts its focus on showing the system- Kino no Tabi is arguably darker and mostly shows the ugly sides of humanity while Mushishi has more of a mix 
The 3 best words to describe both of these shows? Episodic, dark and calming. Both main characters seem devoid of emotion, have interesting (and dark) backgrounds and travel from town to town learning about their chosen field. Whilst Kino travels to learn about the world ( ignoring the problems she faces) Ginko learns about Mushi, an invisible (to most) lifeform (similar to that of insects) solving the problems they cause people who dont know of their existence. Mushishi is extremely dark and most episodes can leave you feeling bittersweet or on the verge of tears. If you enjoy The Beautiful World, you will no doubt adore Mushishi as well. read more 
Vast world, main character doesn't stay at one place too long, calm toned, similar animation quality, episodic. 
both are adventure themedboth are episodic seriesboth are very philosophical both have very main characters who have an uncaring attitude towards life 
The main character of both anime is a travelor. In the case of Kino no Tabi, Kino visits different countries and gets to know people's way of living. Mushishi shows how Ginko discovers the life of Mushi. One difference is that Kino doesn't interfere in the people's lives while Ginko always helps those who are affected by a Mushi. In Kino no Tabi you get to see a few short fights which is not the case in Mushishi. 
Two lone travelers exploring beautiful fantasy worlds and encountering unique characters along their journey. Both anime give a calm vibe but at the same time, there's always a dark side or dark theme involved.Every Mushi-related issue solved by Ginko or city visited by Kino have a fairy tale feel.The protagonist in each anime also share a mysterious aura, are generally very calm or 'cool', and have a background and motivation to go on a journey.The supportive characters in both anime are also very likable and charismatic. 
They are both episodic TV shows, which are depressing + there is a guy wandering around the world. Kino's on his journey and Ginko is looking for and dealing with Mushi.  
These shows see the world through the eyes of the traveler, giving an objective commentary to the worlds they visit. Each episode is a self contained narrative and their respective protagonists have mysterious back stories. 
Not a discovery, but it is always good to remind how close Mushishi is to Kino no Tabi. Both series are episodic and have a different story in every chapter. Kino and Ginko are pretty similar: cold-minded, warm-hearted characters that are not good or bad, just ""they"", and in the end the philosophy is somehow the same: everywhere you go you'll find something new and different.I recommend that if you liked one, you should watch the other, because for me, being a Kino fan, I am enjoying Mushishi. 
Mushishi and Kino no Tabi are episodic and follow one or two charcters respectively for the anime's entirety.  The main similiarity is that both shows excel at developing their calm but interesting atmospheres, which improves them both greatly. 
These two anime are both episodic and have similar pacing. As much as I love mushishi I believe Kino's Journey has more to offer. Kino's Journey touches on many topics Mushishi doesn't such as human ideology, culture, and much more in just 12 episodes. Kino is also an amazing character with phenomenal writing. All and all if you enjoyed Mushishi I believe you would enjoy Kino's Journey just as much if not more.  
I found it hard to find some as calm yet dynamic as Mushi-shi, but Kino no Tabi gave me that similar feeling. In both shows the only thing they ties each other all together is the main character, Ginko or Kino. Kino no Tabi replicates the feeling that Mushi-shi gave- a world outside the main character. Both have beautiful animation and episode to episode plots. I still prefer Mushi-shi, but Kino is still an amazing show that is worth checking out. "
486,2966,7,"Slow-paced anime about travelling and encountering different cultures.  
Both have jorney as a very important part of the whole story, but Spice and Wolf is one story instead of story-per-episode structure of Kino's Journey. 
Both are very calm, ""chill"", and enchanting, follow a pair's journey across vast landscapes, and often hold very little in the way of action (though tidbits here and there crop up), aside from dialogue exchange and focus on the scenery/townscapes. 
Both are relatively calm shows featuring traveling themes and the dangers of such a life. Kino is more about different cultures and ideas, while Spice deals more with economics and the life of a traveling salesman. 
Both series contain quite a lot similarities tbh:- fantasy/supernatural elements- traveler style genre- an independent and self rigthous main heroine- an adventurous theme- contains dilemma involving other characters as the journey continues - deals with human interaction- similar atmosphere- similar pace- adventure takes different customs as episodes progresses- contains a moral lesson/value for each journey 
Duo of protagonists (technically, if we count Hermes) travelling around the world visiting countries with different customs and interacting with others as we learn the life stories of multiple secondary characters. 
The biggest similarity is the soundtracks for sure, from the opening of first episode I immediately got reminded of Spice&Wolf. Both are sad in an interesting way.Also both series' main characters travel through land to land, only in Spice&Wolf they have a final destination and a non-episodic storyline which mainly involves trading plans and such. But still some plot points are mainly aimed at the audience just like in all episodes of Kino no Tabi.Spice&Wolf has a way more happy atmosphere and is more colourful but the characters have a different kind of dialogue which keeps the interest in them just like in Kino no Tabi.  read more "

Both are episodic shows with leads who don't show much emotion, the draw of both shows is the episodic person/place they go to and the story that results from that, and both are more atmospheric than story driven. Kino's Journey is just more philosophical while Violet Evergarden is more emotions based.  
Both shows focus on the protagonist visiting various people, and learning about their customs, as well as helping them deal with problems

Both series have a similar feel to them. I personally liked Natsume Yuujinchou better, because of the characters.  
- In Natsume Yuujinchou there are two main characters, namely Natsume and his bodyguard/companion Nyanko sensei (Madara). This is similar to Kino no Tabi where Kino is accompanied by his talking motorcycle Hermes. - Natsume helps/deals with Youkai and Kino visits countries, each one unique and a world on its own. Both have beautifully crafted episodes that present slice of life things. In general an experience is shown rather than it being judgemental.-Both series are relaxing (although some might cry) and episodic.-Last but not least, both are master pieces. "

Both are about sports and both have a MC who is often underestimated by other (atleast in the beggining).

Both anime films directed by Mamoru Hosoda deal with a world based on our world with some supernatural beast-like elements.The biggest similarity is both are movies that deal with parenthood and children growing up and coming into their own. Wolf Children is more about a mother and her two kids while Boy and the Beast is about a son and his father.Both are solid movie experiences and are donely fairly well. I think parents are more likely to get a kick out of them but I can see many enjoying their stories. 
- Both are animal-human stories, but wolf children is a little more dramatic.- Similar satisfatory feeling with the animation / Plot. 
Both anime movies are directed by Mamoru Hosada.They have similar art style and animation.  Both have beasts and animals that can talk, so interaction between humans and animals/beasts. Great and heartwarming story, very detailed and with lots of action. Definitely will keep you entertained.   
First of all, both movies are written/directed by the same guy so the art styles are very similar. The Boy and The Beast and Wolf Children are both very similar. They both involve a human having some sort of relationship with a beast. They're both heartwarming and both span over a long period of time. Although, Boy and the Beast has more action in it and, in my opinion, is funnier than Wolf Children in terms of comedy.  
Same production, same animation, same torrent of feelings : both touching as hell . The two stories are really different, but every elements that made Ookami Kodomo a good movie are also in Bakemono no Ko . Be sure you watch it if you liked this movie 
Difference- Ookami will lead you to see how amazing for someone to become single-mother- Bakemono is like fulfill each other missing pieces and pull out inner strength to do sth 
Unique upbringing. Wolf Children and The Boy and The Beast both follow children raised by parents with a unique biological factor between the two relations.Wolf Children's human mother Hana has to raise two literal half-wolf/human children. Boy and Beast follows human Ren entering the beast realm, only to grow onto Kumatetsu as a disciple of his.Both are great movies made by the same studio, Studio Chizu, and the same director, Mamoru Hosoda. 
How the single parent feels when raising their kids, and vice versa?Both movies give some kind of sense of that question. They give an answer about how a man or a woman become a single parent (not because they have been forced into). Both also give the same perspective from the ""kid"" char. "
28805,199,8,"- Small child trapped in a fantasy/spirit world.- Small child grows and makes the best of their situation.- Small child earning their keep and learning new things.- Traditional Japanese-style fantasy realm.Spirited Away is the much better paced, written, and animated story of the two. Bakemono no Ko attempts to be a bit more 'grown-up', and has a story spanning a much longer period of time. 
Coming-of-age movies about a child happening upon another world. Both are delightfully evocative with consistent interest and tight animation. 
The alternate worlds in both movies give a similar surreal, dream-like feeling 
These films are extremely similar, child runs off and gets lost in a new world filled with weird beings. They both find someone that will guide them though it, teaching them the ways of life there. But eventually their goal is to return to the human world. Both these films are masterpieces a highly recommend both 
These films explore the boundary between the human and fantasy worlds. The protagonists are young children who mature through their experiences within the other world after receiving the help of magical creatures. The stories focus on family (whether it's adoptive or biological), unlikely friends, and personal growth through learning. The fantastical wonder in a child's mind as s/he sees the world - that's what these films will bring back to you, regardless of what age you are now. 
Similar stories about humans going to a world of monsters/spirts/beastsThey both have amazing animation. 
Both are about a young MC who gets lost in a alternative world and find a mentor to guide them. 
Starting out as a bratty kid who only thinks about themselves characters, Chihiro and Ren find themselves crossing a barrier between the norm and the supernatural, into a mystical world not like the one they are used to. Full of mythical humanoid characters, in a landscape where they are now the irregulars, the two embark on a tale of growing up.The Boy and The Beast are much more explicit with the theme of ""growing up"" so much that Ren, the protagonist, goes through a coming of age story. Spirited Away is much more implicit in that Chihiro learns from her time in the spirit world she gets a job in. Both tell a great tale of simply growing up and understanding that not everything will come your way, sometimes you need to work your way to the life you want to go accordingly. They both also get given new names upon arriving at the new world; ""Sen"" and ""Kyuta"" respectively.Both are great anime movies with Boy and Beast featuring good comedy as well as some action. Spirited Away having a much more peaceful atmosphere for an adventure-fantasy. read more "

I think both animes really bring more to Japanese animation.NGE is until today known for its very good animation at the time (1995)Similarly, currently Unlimited Blade Works has an impressive animation: clever use of CGI in the fighting and the settings. If you look at the animation as an art, I think you'll be very pleased to Unlimited Blade Works.

4081,457,76,"Natsume and Mushishi are both about the interaction between spirits and humans and nature. Both shows do an amazing job with the storytelling, the characters, and playing with your emotions. If you liked one, you'll surely like the other. 
Both of the main characters can see spirits. Both series are episodic, they can be watched in almost any order. Both have a lot of drama packed into these short stories. 
Deals with the supernatural and very episodic. Has the same calm, bittersweet atmosphere at the end.  
Though the two have their differences, both are about a main character who can see something others can't, and strives to help them. Also, both stories have a certain almost laid-back atmosphere to them. Natsume Yuujinchou, however, has more of a plot than Mushishi, as well as supporting characters that stay for more than one episode. 
If you liked Mushishi I believe you'll most definitely enjoy Natsume Yuujinchou. :) I could see similarities right off the bat, in how they both deal with spirits or other supernatural creatures. Both main characters have a sense of compassion when interacting with these entities, and often will try to find the least violent method of solution. Also, both series are episodic, yet it's a style that suits them well. The day-to-day solving of problems has a relaxing sort of mood in both series, and I think they complement each other nicely. 
Both deal with things that can only be seem by few people. Both have the main character helping someone in which only they could provide assistance. Each episode is about a different spirit/mushi.  
Spirits are all around us, but only some have the gift to see them. Both series are somewhat episodic, revolving around human interactions with spirits, as well as with each other. 
Both are calm, slice-of-life-ish series that deal with the supernatural (youkai/mushi) in one- or two-episode arcs and have protagonists who are quiet and standoffish as a result of their abilities to deal with the supernatural. 
Although not similar in the aspect of Japanese Youkai, Mushishi still has good Japanese environments and the obvious feature of spirits that can only seen by certain people. Not many blatant parallels can be made between the two, though there's a high chance that anyone who likes Natsume Yuujin-Chou will like Mushishi. 
If you liked Mushishi, you'll probably like Natsume Yuujinchou too. Each episode is a seperate story, and involves with spirits. The artwork of both of the series are soft colors and a pleasure to watch. Mushishi uses earthtones and Natsume Yuujinchou soft pastels though. 
Both wonderfully soothing atmospheric slice-of-life series involving male protagonists with the uncommon ability to see spirits. In the course of these episodic stories, we learn that these spirits are neither good nor evil, that they simply exist - a message both shows seem to reinforce. Mushishi tends to be more dramatic, whereas Natsume Yuujinchou carries more of a comedic touch. 
You'll surely notice since first episode how much those two anime are very similar to eachother.- Main character: a quiet, good and mature guy (Natsume and Ginko) which has to deal in his own way with spirits/mushi. They both care abouth the spirits and always tried to do everything to help them and not let people thinking that they are to be considered as ""evil"".- Atmosphere: colors, art, music, design will let you fully love the litterally pureness of those anime. The atmosphere is very calm and ""delicated"".Personally i think that both, Mushishi and Natsume Yuujinchou, are two masterpieces which you can't miss to watch, especially if you already enjoyed one of the two! read more 
Both anime have a calming atmosphere and tells the story of someone with a special ability as they learn to live with the supernatural. 
Except for the basic plot: odd things that only some people can see but still can affect many, the main characters are extemely siimilar. They are both easy-going, adorable guys that will try to do whats best depending on the situation rather than some idea that all unknown creatures are evil and needs to be exterminated. 
Both series are slow paced, and are focused on youkai, with standalone episodes. Natsume yuujinchou is lighter than Mushishi though. 
Similar classic Japanese spirit seer protagonist and mysterious bittersweet stories. 
Beautiful episodic tales surrounding the interaction between spirits and humans with a single mature and introspective male protagonist holding the thread between episodes.Mushishi focuses more on japanesse folklore tales in a rural fudal setting and its more moral driven, whetheras Nastume Yuujinchou is more quaint and simple, following a school boy and his spirit relationships. 
Mushihi's drama is more than Natsume Yuujinchou even though both they relax u a lot :) Both anime's story about a guy who wanna help ghosts ( it's name change anime to anime like Yokai & Mushi ) and humans. So they are similar in many ways :) 
Both anime are episodic and supernatural. They have a relaxing atmosphere. Though the protagonists are different, they are both able to see things that normal people can't see, mushi/spirits. 
Natsume yuujinchou's story have a similiarity to mushishi.. it all about japanesse mystery story.. 
Slow pace anime with magic creatures and epic story  
Both are one-shots that follows the life of one character (though Natsume's Book of Friends starts branching out more) and you will likely need a box of tissues. 
Both stories follow the main character, who can see strange things. Both series have the same atmosphere, though Mishishi seems to be a more mature. Both stories are warm, affecting and a little bit bittersweet. 
Calm, episodic anime with supernatural aspects. 
BOth anime somehow tackles the supernatural side (mushi and yokai) meeting new pwoplw along the way of their journey. Slow in pace but has lessons to give in ife. 
These dramas share a slow, easy pace that really allows them to develop a nice atmosphere. Watching these shows leaves me feeling peaceful and calm.They are both episodic. Nastume Yuujinchou centers around the main character meeting and helping a different spirit each episode. Mushishi is similar, having the main character meet and help someone with a spirit related problem each episode. 
The setting is famiiar - both main heroes can see otherwordly creatures, the atmosphere is quite the same too, although theese animes still leave different impressions. 
Mushishi and Natsume Yuujinchou both have many similarities. The main characters of shows are the only people that can see spirits. The MC's want to help the people and spirits throughout the series. There isn't much of a plot in both the shows but each episode is very emotional and dramatic.  
Both series have an episodic nature and are slow-paced with their stories. The story of both series focuses on dealing with the problems of individual people. In Natsume Yuujinjou this is done through the Book of Friends while in Mushishi it is the mushi that inhabit people. Both series have a large deal of emotions involved and also a large amount of moral questions are raised. 
Both are about interactions with supernatural entities and solving various problems caused by them. They are quite lighthearted but can be very serious and grim when they want to be. Very nice art, excellent soundtracks, and similar mood throughout. Mushishi is a bit more isolated and solitary.  
Both stories are about life with another being.Ayakashi in Natsume Yuujinchou are human like being, where Mushi are more like primitive beings.Both stories are focusing in slice of life and drama. But Natsume Yuujinchou is more slice of life, where Mushishi is more drama.Both are top tier class animes. 
Both series gives off a similar feeling in which the main protagonist is able to see supernatural beings where normal people cannot. Although lacking a direct story line, both series has very interesting concepts and ideas that tells a different story each episode. The episodes themselves are lighthearted and has a relaxing feeling to them. The way these two series tell their stories in a surreal and unique presentation. There are spirits involved in both series as we take a glimpse into how they behave around human beings and specifically the main protagonist. Although slow paced, the exploration of the many ideas are quite insightful to watch. read more 
both are relaxing anime in which the main character empathizes with other characters who they meet and try to help them. main character in both anime can see things that not many other people can (mushi/youkai) 
Got the same style as Natsume Yuujinchou, is a slice of life, adventure, but is quiet and relaxing and episodic , the anime style put you in calm mood and u always crave for more eps . 
Both are Slice-of-Life anime where the mc deals with supernatural (yokai/mushi) with kindness. Great light-hearted anime that you can watch and relax to. 
As many other people point out, this is as close to Mushishi as you can get. Both deal with Youkai/Ayakashi and are (mostly) episodic in nature, meaning there isn't necessarily a set overall plot, but a series of situations/problems where the entire story of it is contained in one episode, which Mushishi absolutely nailed. Natsume is definitely more heart-warming and emotional than Mushishi, but both will leave your heart tingling. 
Both main characters can see things that normal people can't, spirits. Witch a calm and peaceful feel to it, both main characters encounter both good and bad spirits, and helping those in need. Both main characters are pretty quiet, and are the loner type. When they were children, the were thought of a freaks for seeing things no one else could see.  After meeting different kinds of spirits their outlook about them and life changes. Both animes are episodic, with both good, sad, and bittersweet endings. 
Both anime have the same peaceful setting, and each episode there's a new mushi/ayakashi that our main character meets. Unlike other people who usually fear mushi/ayakashi, Natsume/Ginko (the MCs) try their best to understand them and their true nature.  
Both was able to features Japanese Folklore so well and interesting 
These are both calm and slow paced anime. The feeling of the show is the biggest similarity. Both center around the main character who can see things not everybody can, following events happening around these things. 
Natsume yuujinchou and Mushishi both have aspects of a character who can see supernatural things that very few people can see or understand. also both are slow paced mature anime 
Both have to do with spiritual creatures called ""yokai"". Both are very beautiful and imaginative anime. Highly recommend watching 
Both are series in which ghosts or spirits exist and only certain people can see them. They are both extremely relaxing to watch, the sort of thing you'd watch an episode of before you go to sleep to give yourself a nice dream. Although Mushishi occasionally has unhappy endings and has a more wistful and dreamy atmosphere compared to Natsume Yujinchou's ""smiley sunny everyone's friends lets help each other out and be happy"" kind of atmosphere in which comedy is occasionally added. In my opinion occasional unhappy endings are a good thing as it adds variety, and I guess it suits the feel of the anime so don't immediately cross Mushishi out. Most of the time each episode has it's own plot line, and one arc rarely continues for more than an episode's length. In this case that also adds to the relaxing effect because you don't have to follow an intricate story line. I personally find the most relaxing animes the ones where you don't have to think. Anyway, both animes are brilliant, personally I prefered Mushishi just because I like the strange lovecraft sort of atmospheres and the protagonist is pretty interesting, unlike your generic anime hero... read more 
main characters of these series are able to see spirits and go around solving problems. the two anime is also episodic which is smoothing and relaxing. japanese folklore 
The key fundamental similarity between both of these series is that they are both episodic, giving each individual episode it's own story arc which doesn't directly connect to other episodes much further than the recurring characters e.g. Ginko, Madara etc. They both center around the theme of the supernatural, both introducing fantasy creatures e.g. Mushi from Mushishi. Mushishi I would describe as more on the philosophical and harder watching side than Natsume Yuujinchou, which has a more of a Slice of Life feeling to it while still remaining thought provoking. They are both slow paced and minimalisitic animes with simple but beautiful animation (especially mushishi) but are probably best watched in moderation rather than 'marathoning' a series. Both Awesome and Original :) read more 
If you like Mushishi then I'm sure you will like Natsume. Because in both animes the plot and aura is very similar. There is spiritual things and myths of the Japan folk. I enjoy and liked so much Mushishi and Natsume. There are so relaxing, with beautiful soundtrack, nice main chatacters and with a fantasy mythology that involved the plot. Very recommended! 
Both centred around Youkai, slow paced story lines, and a great lot of character development and emotions.  
Both peaceful animeSimilar animeBoth relaxing 
Supernatural/ghosts; Protagonist is a special person who can see these supernatural things and helps others deal with them; both have a very chill and bittersweet feel and slice of life 
Similarities: both animes are largely episodic, both really only have a handful of main characters (although mushishi is mostly just Ginko), have a similar atmosphere about them and both main characters deal with helping people affected by spirits, or the spirits themselves. Differences: Natsume is set in modern day Japan and he lives in the countryside, Mushishi is set in the past and Ginko is a nomad. Natsume also deals with a more personified version of spirits (youkai/ayakashi), whereas mushishi's spirits (mushi) don't really have any character to them. Natsume also has more of a goal he wants to achieve (book of friends), unlike Ginko. Both are equally very enjoyable, and highly recommended. read more 
       Mushishi and Natsume Yuuchinjou are very good and enjoyable series. The protagonists of both series, Ginko and Natsume, deal with spiritual species that interact with humans, which are known as Mushi (Mushishi) and Ayakashi/Youkai (Natsume Yuuchinjou). Both Ginko and Natsume also deal with loneliness, but still use the gifts/powers they have to help others. They are episodic as well. Both characters accept these spirits as parts of their lives. Ginko before the beginning of the story's setting, and Natsume throughout the show.      However, there are still some differences between the two. For almost every episode of Mushishi, Ginko is usually requested to help a character that has a ""disease/illness"". He tries to diagnose the problem, and the cause of the problem is always because of the Mushi, in whatever way possible. Ginko then gets rid of the Mushi, but will never kill them, unlike other mushishi. In Natsume Yuuchinjou, Natsume usually helps either a youkai or human with a problem they have, and with those problems, most of the time, he has to use his Yuuchinjou. Mushishi episodes almost always end in a depressing or non-happy way. In Natsume Yuuchinjou, the story of that episode always has a happy ending. Ginko and maybe just one or two other characters reappear throughout the show. In Natsume Yuuchinjou, there are plenty of characters that appear along the way, humans and youkai. There's more comedic scenes in Natsume Yuuchinjou than in Mushishi as well.    In conclusion, both are very well-done series, and are very emotional. Natsume Yuuchinjou is very similar to Mushishi, but is less depressing and deals with more characters. read more 
Both Mushishi and Natsume Yuujinchou have a laid back, relaxing athmosphere and an episodical way of telling the different stories that each has to offer. Both shows deal with lead characters that can see creatures that others can't and their interaction with them.However, while Mushishi tends to be more dramatic, Natsume has a little more of a comedian touch to it. 
Supernatural creatures that both characters can see that others can not. Both series are soft and relaxing 
The Mushishi series and the Natsume Yuujinchou series are both relaxing series. Both involve protagonists who can see supernatural entities, who learn or have learned to deal with this ability as they grow older. Ginko makes it his life work to work with and deal with mushi (the supernatural entity in Mushishi) and Natsume learns to coexist with yokai whilst slowly learning about the world and politics around exorcists. They both are largely episodic in nature, with Natsume Yuujinchou having more overarching narratives. 
They are both about a Main Character that can see magical creatures (ayakashi and mushi).Both give a pleasant ride for the spectator, being an episodic kind of show, that follows a simple story line at times.Both are really good, and if you like one of them, it is a fact that you would like the other one. 
Both animes have a supernatural theme, yet are not packed with pure action and fights and such. They are slow-paced and look at things at a different perspective. Plus, the atmosphere in both is really calming and both are good animes to watch, if you want each episode a new story to be told. 
Both animes are about the main character meeting spiritual beings and solving problems related to those spiritual beings. Both are episodic animes . And in both anime only a few can see those spiritual beings . And both animes have a mysterious and calm atmosphere that makes it feel like its a great sol anime. 
Both these are really calming to watch it lifts your spirits. Natsume Yuujinchou has youkais while Mushishi has mushi both which impact their lives. They kind of have a soft warm lonely feeling to it. 
Both these animes focus on bringing the unseen world of yokai to life through vivid narration and interesting characters . 
Both are episodic spiritual adventures that give off the same vibe both having a bittersweet ending  
Supernatural anime series with a Japanese atmosphere, lots of very memorable episodes. 
both are about  mythical creatures and they are episodic animes following the life ofa young man and his relationship with these creatures also they are relaxing to watch 
They both involve characters that interact with spirts that most others can see. Both of them are more or less episodic, focusing in a different spirit each episode. MC does his best to help the spirit or those affected by the spirit. 
These convey an inner peace (equivalent to nirvana) and a sense of break from the busy monotony of contemporary society through the folklore japanese // Estos transmiten una paz interior (equivalente al nirvana) y una sensación de descanso de la bulliciosa monotonía de la sociedad occidental contemporánea a través del folclore japonés. 
Natsume Yuujinchou is basically Mushishi only with more laughs, more happy endings and a somewhat less fatalistic view of life. Both are centred around creatures that almost only the protagonist can see although while there are good/evil Yokai in Natsume Yuujinchou the Mushi of Mushishi are neither evil nor good, they are simply lifeforms and do what they have to survive. 
Both series are about demons and supernatural beings that live in this world but few can see it. 
Both shows focus on aiding with problems regarding supernatural entities. Both shows are also more atmospheric in progression 
Both are slow paced but interesting anime. 
Both involve a main character who encounters demons (or in the case of Mushishi a strange species of creature called Mushi) dealing with the supernatural while revealing the human natures and philosophical aspects of humanity through interactions with supernatural elements 
The same recurring theme, chilling soundtracks, unique plots and most of all a satisfying watch for all the mushishi fans out there. 100% recommended 
Main characters travel around encountering various supernatural occurrences and attempt to resolve them. 
Both the main characters can see things others cannot.In Natusme Yuujinchou, the people around him don't necessarily believe that what he sees are real, so this anime is has an alternate viewpoint to me. 
- Both have wise, emphatic and calm protagonists being able to interact with the supernatural world- Both share a similar art style and mood- Both don't take side with neither the humans nor the supernatural, aiming for fair balance rather- Both share a positive, compromising approach to solutions of the challenges both protagonists solveThe main differences are:- the nature of the supernatural world. Mushishi's entities are closer to natural phenomenons and animal intelligence creatures meeting ordinary humans, while Natsume deals with humanoid, sentient ghosts.- Natsume's  challenges tend to be more interpersonal and emotional level, and have more dialogue involved.- Natsume has a recurring cast spanning multiple seasons, whereas Mushishi is (except for he Doctor) a one person piece. read more 
Anthology/episodic, ayakashi, freeing troubled people/spirits, overall feel 
Both are serial anime.Both main character have special ability which is can see what most people can't (Mushi and soul).Have the similiar conflict but different object.Have a warm, sad, and miss feeling when it ends in every episode. 
natsume yuujinchou and Mishi-shi both have aspects of a chariter who can see supernatural things that very few people can see or understand. also both animes have a relaxing sence to it, no realy big bad guy and each protagonist takes life as it comes. "
4081,10408,29,"Hotarubi no Morie e is like a longer Natsume Yuujinchou episode without Nyanko-sensei. 
Hotarubi no Mori e brings some of the best things about Natsume Yuujinchou in one neat 40 minute package. It is pretty much a Natsume Yuujinchou episode, sans Natsume and Nyanko-Sensei, plus the benefit of extra 20 minutes and a higher budget. That makes for a incredibly well done story with one of the sweetest (and saddest) romances I've seen in anime. This should be a must watch for Natsume fans. If you loved the movie but never watched Natsume... well, what on earth are you waiting for? 
Of course watching Hotarubi is like watching Natsume Yuujinchou.Not only they are from the same manga-ka, therefor sharing the same gorgeous art and a similar story telling as well the taste for the same genre: those are two titles who, if you liked one of them, you can't absolutly miss to wach the another as well!Both are sweet, delicate stories, with splendid colors and wonderful characters who'll bring you into those supernatural and fascinating worlds.Both give you the same calm feeling while watching them.Indeed, very highly recommended both ♥ 
Not only do Natsume Yuujinchou and Hotarubi no Mori e have the same original creator and similar setting, they are animated by the same studio, with the same director and even the composer is the same. Without any doubt there is more than one that these two would both be liked by the same people.The girl, Hotaru, in Hotarubi no More e and the boy, Takashi (mostly referred to by his family name Natsume), both see demon and spirits and they both befriend them. Both the film and the series play with a melancholic feeling and the relationship between humans and spirits. 
Hotarubi no Mori e is like the 2 episode version of Natsume Yuujinhou. Even the main characters Natsume and Jin are similiar. Also, musics, the athmosphere and animation styles are alike. I loved Hotarui no Mori e more than Natsume because there was a romantic story in it. I wish it could become longer. 
Not only do they share the same creator, their art style, the music, the setting and themes are similar as well. They are both touching and will probably leave you with tears. 
Both are about Youkai. Both have that bittersweet feeling to it.Hotarubi is about love while Natsume is about friendship with Youkai. If you enjoyed one of them, you will enjoy the other. 
Both anime are written by the same author, Yuki Midorikawa hence contains similar themes, mood, and settings.Both series has a mystical feeling which is smooth, slow paced, serene, and natural. The music in both series are also collected and calm. Both series also involves a main protagonist dealing with supernatural beings, specifically spirits.These two anime are both relaxing to watch that are considered rare gems. 
Gin gives an extremely similar feeling to Natsume. They are both extremely soothing and relaxing to watch, although one offers a more dramatic experience. 
Same voice actor for main male lead and similar plot about ghost spirits wandering around. The main story of Hotarubi is limited by the fact that it's movie, and so it doesn't have as much touching stories as Natusme, yet it is still very moving. Both emphasizes the importance of relationships, especially that of a close friend. 
Hoturabi no Mori e is almost exactly like an episode of Natsume Yuujinchou without natsume in it. About a Girl who meets a youkai it is also extremely touching. 
Similar Artwork, similar soundtrack, similar storyline. Both stories are about interaction between yōkai (supernatural monsters) and humans. Protagonists in both stories are complex and evolve in beautiful ways.   
They're both really calm and lovely shows. Hotarubi no Mori e is a movie, while Natsume Yuujinchou has four seasons. They both follow a human who sees spirits and occasionally hangs out with them. 
A dip in the simplicity and tranquility in a rural landscape through appearances in folklore,the charm, the beauty and magic of the forest and, the ""poetry"" of a wonderful Yuki Midorikawa. 
Both were originally written by the same author so they have very similar tones and have stories that revolve around human/yokai interactions. Both capture a peaceful and beautiful tone, however the movie Hotarubi no Mori e does have a heartbreaking sad part as opposed to Natsume Yuujinchou which tends to be bittersweet. 
It's like Natsume Yuujinchou, but shorter and with some romance mixed in.  Even if you don't like romance, watch it! 
Two animes that show us several points of view about the feelings of the Yokai, mainly the solitude, where although some hate humans, others wish to approach them. Where the protagonist is relates to the world of the Yokai, knowing more what they feel in their eternal loneliness. 
They both share the same director, and both share the same setting of the story  - a real world, but with spirits  living together with humans. Beautiful and touching stories, amazing animation and art, you will enjoy every minute of it.  
Both focus on youkai, the spiritual world, and the connection of people to it. Both take a softer and slower pace, and focus on character above action. 
Meeting and Farewell. Human instinct is appear as true color.Through the happy times and the sad times, after all you recalled important person.It is heartwarming or loneliness. Bittersweet memories will miss you. Do you have them in the first place? The answer should up to you.NY and Hotarubi no Mori e are written by same author. Of course, they are similar in every way.Takashi Natsume meets various creatures commencing with Madara. Himself always grow. Rise over time.Hotaru Takegawa meets Gin. Gin's look and existence are mixture of Natsume and Madara, and has mysterious secret.NY is TV show. Hotarubi no Mori e is short movie. Both feeling have kindness of heart.Both are rather wonderful works. These works charm you. And, NY is series. You'll like NY's sequels. read more 
Produced by the same studio, so if you enjoy the style of Natsume Yuujinchou then you'll love Hotarubi no Mori e. Both explore the relationship between people and spirituality, with Hotarubi no Mori e focusing more on romance. Can't recommend these works enough, 10/10 for both. 
Both works are from the author Yuki Midorikawa.Natsume Yuujinhou and Hotarubi no Mori e both tell stories about the various ways the line separating humans and youkai is crossed. Hotarubi no Mori e tries to bridge the gap between its main characters through a more interpersonal relationship while Natsume Yuujinchou has the main character try to reconnect with humans while struggling with his tight connections to the world of youkai for an intrapersonal mode of story telling.Atmosphere and setting has clear similarities between each accompanied by a similar OST as well. Both highly enjoyable watches for those looking for some Iyashikei-esque anime. 
The movie seems like a Natsume Yuujinchou movie with different characters and romance (the two anime have the same producer and sound director). To sum it up, the setting is the same: there are youkai and the story mostly takes place in a forest, both anime are calming and lovely. If you liked the latter aspects, you may most likely enjoy Natsume Yuujinchou a lot.  
Both explore the same themes like relationship between humans and Yokai 
Both are written by the same author. Hotarubi is basically an extra special episode from Natsume with different characters and no Nyanko-Sensei to kill the mood. 
Both shows deal with human interactions involving spirits. Hotaru although, is much shorter and focuses more on romance whereas Natsume focuses on relationship building  
Both has a similar feel to the setting and simplistic yet calming art with Japanese folklore elements. Both main characters have the ability to see youkai(spirits) and befriends them. The stories of both shows are moving and touching that will most likely bring tears to your eyes. 
- Same studio.- Shoujo.- Boys with supernatural powers.Honestly, these two anime just give you all the feels. 
big yokai energy. we stan. similar settings.also the main characters are very good 8)  "
4081,31646,15,"deals a lot with depression and opening your heart to others. both are very good at changing your feelings with the mood it sets. some scenes can feel cold and distant, while others feel warm and welcoming. they're overall fluffy, feel good shows. both protagonists are quiet, antisocial, and not good at expressing themselves. both are also frequently taken care of by kind people who are not blood-relatives.    
A mellow athmosphere with character relations as the main focus. 
- Main characters are presented as precocious children who are initially withdrawn from society due to circumstances.- Story is nonlinear and series is broken up into short stories. Mainly seem to be coming of age stories of protagonists slowly coming out of their shell.- Shows make viewers want to protect their sweet cinnamon rolls. 
Both are slice of life shows about boys dealing with isolation and depression who learn to open up, depend on others, and be happy. Both are very touching with beautiful character development. Rei and Natsume are similar character archetypes, and if you enjoy either show for the main character, you'll definitely like the other show. 
Both the MC's of respective shows are a lot alike, they both close and choose to restrain themselves at first but as they meet people, the barrier they initially put erodes and show another side of themselves.  
The great point is the personal rhythm of the anime series, with a great visual style where the characters evolve how humans, with feelings and discover the world of the friends and family, but always supported on an element that marks his life. 
Although Natsume Yuujinchou is a fantasy slice of life with supernatural yokais and 3-gatsu no Lion is about shogi, they have similar themes in overcoming struggles, depression etc. They have similar vibes and look good and unique. 
Both about introverted high schoolers, whose parents died when they were young, dealing with their own issues and slowly coming out of their shell with the help of other people and sometimes, in the case of Natsume, yokai. 
Both main characters have an extremely difficult time accepting affection and tend to be extremely cautious with opening their hearts. 
Nice, slow pace. Lots of sad stories, but has a bitter-sweet feeling that lingers and warms your soul. Great anime, great music and great characters too. 
we can sense the same warm and sad feeling from them plus the background music is really support that feeling. the characters face same difficulties of being alone and for the first time finding the meaning of love from friends etc, 
-Both the MCs have somewhat of a sad past, but slowly break out of those shells by forming close bonds with people around them.-They both learn to trust the people around them, while also learning lessons from those that mean harm to them as well.-Both series revolve greatly around SoL and emotions. 
Both are heartwarming slice of life dramas that have kind but troubled protagonists learning to rely on others and open up about themselves.  If you take the youkai and fantasy elements out of Natsume Yuujinchou you would have Sangatsu no lion at its core.  The supporting casts for both shows are fantastic, and the art and soundtracks are beautiful.  Please give both shows a watch!   
Similarities:- Both MC parents are not alive anymore and both have to live with other people- Both MC felt out of place- Both have bittersweet past- Both are ""saved"" by another family 
the characters both are melancholic, deals with healing and found family. sad orphan boys :( "
4081,199,13,"similiar style of heart-warming supernatural story with similiar facinating ghosts characters. Touching scenes & stories.. 
If you liked this anime you will definitely like Spirited Away, the main character in both animes can see spirits and they have to deal with them through it. 
Both deal with the interactions between an ordinary human protagonist and the supernatural creatures they encounter. Both have similar meticulous pacing, themes of friendship, character growth, and are pretty much guaranteed to warm your heart at least a little. 
Both are about Youkai. Well, Spirited Away is a wonderfull movie, completely must to see for everyone. The ones who enjoyed Natsume's story will love Chihiro.

both are about spirits, but Spirited away has more action, and Natsume Yuujinchou is more relaxing, :) 
both are full of loving characters you will never forget. while spirited away is more fast paced natsume yuujin is more slow and calm. Both are full of supernatural creatures and the determination of a child/teen to do what they think is right. fully fleshed out characters that are brought to life on the screen right before your eyes. if you liked spirited away you will love natsume yuujin because both are unforgettable in their own right.  
Both have a human become involved in a spirit community. 
Both are supernatural tales regarding interesting ghosts and their stories. Ghosts in both anime aren't the horrific killer ghosts, but just spirits that just want to live peacefully. 
If you love spirited away, I would really recommend watching this!Similar air/vibe about these two and the idea of spirits or youkai is present in both.Both really beautiful. 
If you're a fond of spirits, monsters, or any weird apparitions, but an anime that's got a great story, then Natsume Yuujinchou is for you. 
If you are seeking a Anime with Youkai & Spirits, look no further than Spirited away, and Natsume and the book of friends. Both anime have really good story telling, where Natsume Yuujinchou focus more on many different stories, Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi focuses on one longer one. Both anime are relaxing and some what exciting to watch. If you looking for a good time, or you just finished spirited away but long for some more of those spirit like beings? Check out Natsume Yuujinchou!I´m glad i did! 
Both Natsume and Spirited Away concern the relationships between humans and spirits; in Natsume, it is the relationship between him and the youkai apparently only he can see, in Spirited Away, it is the relationship between Sen and the spirits of the bath house. Due to it being a movie, Spirited Away has a much more prominent plot, whereas Natsume, being a slice of life show, is more laid back with episode-long story arcs. Both are fantastic.  "
4081,5420,6,"Both have a relaxing atmosphere, which is very calming, though it does get serious and there is some action.However Natsume is more orientated towards the supernatural, and Erin is focused more on fantasy. Natsume also seems to be aimed at an older audience. Both are good watches to unwind though. 
The two shows are not directly similar at all. But they're both very peaceful and soothing. They're also the type that appeals to the 'child' inside you  
they both have their calm atmospheric look...their art is little bit alike..both the main characters have supernatural powers...one can see spirits and one can talk to animals... 
I'm not really sure how to explain it but this anime for some reason reminded me a lot of Natsume Yuujinchou. They both tell a story in a different way to most animes and it's a nice change. The stories themselves are not similar but both animes have the same feeling I guess. I might be alone in this recommendation but I think if you enjoyed Kemono no Souja Erin you'll probably enjoy Natsume Yuujinchou.  
Kemono no Souja Erin is similar to Natsume Yuujinchou in the almost slice of life feel it gives off. The peaceful feel good moments and the sad touching moments feel somewhat similar. Erin was picked on because of her hair and Natsume was picked on because he could see youkai. If you look at the titles you can see how they are related. Beast Player Erin, she is friends with the beasts. Natsume's Book of Friends, Natsume becomes friends and enemies with various youkai through the use of the book. Both are shows you grow to love the more you watch them, please give Natsume Yuujinchou a try. read more

4081,33352,6,"yes both of them have a different plot and view. but they do have one similarity and that is how they tell us a heart warming story. 
Violet Evergarden and Natsume Yuujinchou both follow abused and neglected protagonists, who find their place in a cast of colorful characters and learn to embrace the beauty of the world around them. For Natsume, this is by learning to accept both the human and youkai aspects of his life and cherish them both; for Violet, this is by learning the value of emotions, and the complexities of human relationships. Both are shows about healing, and both follow a sort of ""one-shot"" structure, where the main plot of each episode isn't always intrinsically related to the other episodes.  
Both series have the formula of tackling a specific character per episode.The magic of both lies in the power of the viewer sympathizing for that character in a mere 22 minutes. Ranges from heart-warming to straight up sadness 
Both had the same vibes. Both are ""episodic"" series. Both MCs have been outcasts in their pasts 
Tales of pain and sadness told by the others. And by this, over the time, the main character that had undergone their own agonizing past came to see a new perspective of their life, and started to understand their own emotions through those experiences on each its episode.  
both lead is a lonerBoth lead characters face new person/character each episode and try to help them. Violet help by writing letter, Natsume help by releasing them(spirit). "
4081,5081,4,"The reason I started to compare Bakemonogatari and Natsume Yuujinchou actually is that the male main characters are both voiced by Kamiya Hiroshi. Then I started to notice that the themes and the atmosphere is quite similar. And even if the animation is different they share high production values.These shows are about high-school boys who get mixed up with supernatural creatures and phenomenon. The main characters take notice of things that normal humans cannot see and try to help out, even if it is dangerous. The arcs of the different stories are not very long but characters frequently show up again. There is an unique mixture of peacefull daily life and violent supernatural occurences. Bakemonogatari has more graphic violence, Natsume on the other hand always tells touching stories...  read more 
These stories have some interesting parallels. Both are ""boy who can see yokai/spirits"" shows taking place in the modern day, with main characters in high school who help others dealing with problems pertaining to the spiritual world, and have older, more experienced exorcist mentors. The main characters are somewhat similar despite having different appearances and are both voiced by the same Japanese seiyuu. The two mains come to terms with their place, locked between the human and spiritual word, and find happiness in that role.There are some noted differences, however. Bakemonogatari focuses primarily on helping humans who have come across dangerous yokai that are cursing or possessing them, and spirits are rarely characters in and of themselves. It's also much more action-oriented and humorous, along with having a harem aspect to it and use of quirky human characters with moe and fanservice elements. The main character also acquired his ability to see strange think later in life, and is dealing with a new skill rather than an old one.Natsume Yuujinshou is more of a Slice-of-Life, where Natsume helps out and befriends both yokai and humans, as he deals with his ability to see things that others can't. He changes from a person who was alienated and passed from family to family because of his strangeness, and the frightening things he saw as a child. He comes to value his ability as it allows him to make friends with yokai, and help them out. There's some action and humor, but it's a much more subtle and quiet series than Bakemonogatari.The two series themselves have different animation styles, Bakemonogatari's being somewhat bizarre at times, but both are short-story oriented, with Natsume Yuujinchou being completely episodic and Bakemonogatari having short arts a couple episodes long. Both are sometimes considered 'slow' or 'boring',  (though this is far from the case), because Bakemonogatari focuses so much on dialogue and characters, and Natsume has a more quiet atmosphere with only short moments of action or horror. These are both great takes on the ""guy who can see spirits"" genre. And both worthy of a look. read more 
Where do I start?- Protagonist who gets involved with spirits and expert spirits. He tries to help them, without harming their loved ones. Both protas share the same seiyu.- Both have a somewhat slow pace, with a space for different characters, who come to sympathize with the protagonist or take it to a risky situation.- In addition, the protagonist carries a hidden power that makes him a magnet for problems, and always accompanies a powerful supernatural being.And the seasons seem to have no end ... 
Just think of Bakemonogatari as the more violent and weirder version of Natsume Yuujinchou. Instead of Nyanko-sensei, you get one cute girl who transforms into a cat and another cute girl who's a vampire and hides in Araragi's shadow. For me personally, it was like watching an alternate universe Natsume dealing with all the youkai, only this time his ""harem"" is female and not male (laughs). Both are charming in their own way, but basically, if you're looking for something with a lot of Kamiya Hiroshi in it plus a lot of weirdness, this is it. If you're looking for the wholesomeness that is the trademark of the Natsume Yuujinchou series, there are some slivers of it throughout the Bakemonogatari series, but definitely of a lesser preportion.  read more "

Spice and Wolf and Natsume Yuujinchou are rather episodic anime that focus on the development of the two main character's relationships.  While the relationship between Natsume and Nyanko is not romantic it is similiar the the relationship between Horo and Lawerance in that it is between two beings who would ordinarily not get along, Natsume a human and Nyanko a youkai, Lawerance a human and Horo a wolf diety. 
The main characters in both encounter a supernatural being which they become very close with. Both stories are easygoing and relatively peaceful to watch. Each show beautifully incorporates music at the right times to set the mood of the story.

Both series have a similar feel to them. I personally liked Natsume Yuujinchou better, because of the characters.  
- In Natsume Yuujinchou there are two main characters, namely Natsume and his bodyguard/companion Nyanko sensei (Madara). This is similar to Kino no Tabi where Kino is accompanied by his talking motorcycle Hermes. - Natsume helps/deals with Youkai and Kino visits countries, each one unique and a world on its own.

For some reason I kept thinking of Totoro when I watched this series. Both have great artwork, and unique characters.

Both Natsume and Aria are beautiful location and character driven anime. Both series have amazing character development over the episodic episodes that feels very real.

1210,7785,25,"Fans of both have drawn many parallels between the two shows. They're similar in that they are both semi-episodic comedy-drama with similar themes. The MC is a depressed young man trying to cope with the failures of his life, and is surrounded by weird people. Dark, depressing and slightly psychedelic, they're both great shows, and although not very similar, one will remind you of the other.  
Welcome to the NHK is far more depressing than Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei while the later adds a smidgen of bizzaro metaphysics to the later episodes. However they both revolve around a group of oddball people loafing around while helping the main character deal with the failures of his life, in their own way. Not always succesfully. 
Both are based on a human-failure-type character to make up an interesting story and teach us life lessons (only highly-aware viewers can actually learn, though). 
Both shows talk about a despairing life. Youjouhan Shinwa Taikei focuses on a college campus life while Welcome to the NHK focuses on a drop out and a high school girl. Welcome to the NHK differs by extrapolating psychological themes while Taikei focused on humor, but they all talk about the same thing: socializing is beneficial to life. 
Both are episodic shows with protagonists who need to take charge of their lives and both get trippy in the process, though NHK is much darker. 
The main reason why I believe these two to be similar, is the feeling that you get after completing the show, especially the last few episodes of it. As a college student myself these shows made me stop and think about where I am at this point of my life. It's actually pretty damn inspiring. 
Both follow a college aged shut-in through his episodic adventures as he struggles through everyday problems such as social skills, success, love, libido, and finding your place in the world. 
Both tell a story about a loser in life. Both also have a same kind of dark humor style.Difference is just that Tatami Galaxy feels like NHK on drugs. Dialogue goes bulletspeed and animation is ""inconsistent"" and trippy. In a good way. 
The truth is, no other anime comes close to what Welcome to the NHK was. But this one comes the closest.Tatami Galaxy is not as depressing, more artsy, and has higher production value.  
Both follow adult characters discontent with their lives , and their coming to terms with their issues. Both make use of visual storytelling, though Takei does it more often and more explicitly. Takei is a bit more philosophical, and perhaps harder to grasp than NHK. I really like how they take a more realistic approach to the characters' issues instead of a more idealistic one.  
Both anime are about the psyche from the main character and the story is told in a more semi-episodic way. Also the Genre are nearly the same. Both anime have a high psychological level but still keeps in touch with a huge bottle of good jokes and hilarious Character Interactions.Also they use some surreal elements to represent the psyche for a more comprehensible way.As a psychological fan you should definitely watch both shows. 
Both shows deal with a college aged boy's coming of age story. Both highlight themes such as loneliness and cosmic irony. They both feature some of the best story telling I have ever encountered (not just in anime, but in general) and are, ultimately, love stories.  
Both of these series have a great story, are set in modern day and have characters that are very much like real humans. 
Enclosed in your room or on your tatami. Protagonists who want to escape their reality, the life they have borne for years, the mistakes they have had, because of situations that seem to have resulted from a ""conspiracy"" or a ""curse."" In addition, they explore different lifestyles of which they always seek to fit in spite of their weaknesses, but only with the opportunity that can be close to them, they can get what they have always wanted. 
It hurts knowing that things could've been different if different choices were made. These anime blame some type of entity for their own faults in life. While ""The Tatami Galaxy"" focuses on the could've, would've, and should've scenarios, ""Welcome to the NHK"" focuses on rehabilitating the social aspect of giving up on life. Life lessons are taught throughout the shows. 
Both have a feeling of melancholy where everyone feels like there putting on a happy face when there dying inside. Everyone has there own problems is a message both shows convey 
Both are beautiful journeys of young men trying to find a purpose of their lives. 
While Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei (also known as Tatami Galaxy) is very different as it is nowhere near as depressing as NHK ni Youkoso (nor is it supposed to be) they are similar in how they look at the effects of life choices, and can be very real and relatable. Art direction is also similar at times, as Tatami Galaxy uses a bit of surrealism and psychadelic scenes to help tell its story. 
Both are psychological anime that are extremely unique & make you reevaluate life. If you only watch shounen these probably aren't for you.  
 Both shows are both Comedy and Drama, while dealing with similar psychological themes of a protagonist and all his failures. Both also have a rather psychedelic vibe and feature weird, but at times depressing characters. 
If you liked tatami galaxy, you will like this story of regret, time, anxiety, depression 
-they have protagonists with similar personalities.-they are both dramedies about antisocial people. 
Both protagonists are flawed and prominent themes of failure, opportunity and depression are depicted. Has an emphasis on decision and taking one's own initiative rather then being stagnant and not progressing. 
Both provide perspective on life after high school. They are about doing something meaningful with your time. NHK deals with a shut-in NEET while Tatami Galaxy focuses on being in college. 
NHK and tatamy are historis that talk about maturation, maybe by different methods and with different themes but both stories tell us the story of a young adult with a certain immaturity, trying to advance and become better people, they are stories that speak to us of what is the maturation and facing reality with a very good conclusion in both, also both stories have an attractive design, with charismatic and endearing characters as well as a peculiar sense of humor, both works are the best the industry has been able to offer us and without doubt they are two works that are worth seeing. "
1210,9253,18,"The idea that a secret organisation, according to the protagonist, is conspiring against him is a similarity. At the same time both series are perverted and both have a somewhat weird/special female side-character. The main characters in both series also seems a bit awkward when trying to interact with 'normal' people, yet somewhat like a leader among their own small clique/group of friends (which seems to be a coding guy and the weird girl in both series). Besides that, they also have in common that reality seems somewhat off or twisted to the protagonist. There might be more, but this is my impression after the first episode of Steins;Gate :) read more 
The protagonists in both series believe in the existence of a secret organization that is out there to get them. Both shows display a good balance between comedy and darker themes. 
Both feature main protagonists who are slightly nutty, believe in some global conspiracy, and don't like to shave. 
Both anime has an evil Organization and both Male leads is somewhat obsess to it and having delusion about it.. and the female leads also helps the male leads to overcome what's happening both anime has a funny side and serious sides..  
In both shows, the male leads suffer from the delusion that a mysterious secret organisation is conspiring against him. The female leads seem innocent and pure at the first sight, but upon closer inspection they have their own tragic stories to tell.  
They are both great, have dark psychological humor, and leave you with a strange feeling of happy depression. In any case, they are both worth watching if you haven't seen either one. 
While ""Welcome to the NHK"" and ""Steins;Gate"" aren't all similar in overarching plot nor animation style, there is something about the ""normality"" of the two shows that can't be overlooked.Both are them are set in a realistic, believable world, without over-the-top characters. Dialogue is witty and sensible, and both start off relatively harmless, but eventually delve into the psychological drama type of anime. 
The early episodes of Steins;Gate feature a lot of jokes about otaku culture that would fit right in in NHK, plus both shows feature semi-insane main characters who believe that there are secret organizations plotting against them. 
Seto and Okabe are quite alike they both made up a conspiracy theory, they are both awkward to strangers, have a bit of a wrong view on the society and they both have their group where they can be themselves. These series have something big simular in the end but guess if I tell that it is considered spoiling. and except all of this, these are just 2 big masterpieces. 
Both feature conflicted over-the-top main characters overcoming obstacles. 
Both anime have a dark tone with romance added in. Also both have very funny dubs. 
Both anime have a good balance of comedy and dark themes.Both protagonist believe in the existence of an ""organization""Both anime also have a lovely, pretty and helpful female leads that the protagonists relies on, and they both have tsundere tendencies as well.They also have sidekicks who wear glasses....and although farfetched, the protagonists are also trying to be successful in creating something ( in SG, find a way back to the Alpha world line; in NHK, to create a video game)  
Extremely similar main male leads, both believing in existence of secret organizations that are after them, and both are pretty awkward when it comes to social interactions.Both anime start out in earlier episodes mainly focused on humor, but slowly shift into darker themes. 
The whole time I was watching Steins Gate I couldn't but notice the similarities between it and Welcome to the NHK. This is due to the fact that with very few changes the main characters are identical. In Welcome to the NHK the protagonist is a young man who invents a secret organization similarly to the one in Steins Gate. The characters share the same sense of humour and act in the same overdramatic way when they are trying to conceal their feelings or when they try to act with ""normal people"". Both of them have social problems, one being a NEET and the other one having been secluded until forming his laboratory. The difference stems from the level of intelligence and interaction with other characters. But even there are other similarities. Pure-hearted Girls and Tech Geniuses. They deal with different themes but both shine because of the very good charactes. read more 
Both feature a paranoid MC thinking they were involved in some sort of conspiracy (NHK) and hunted by an evil organization (Steins Gate). Both anime also have female leads that can understand and empathize with the protagonists and at the same time help them to overcome their problem. Just like Steins;gate, NHK  also starts off rather slow and static. Only starting to pick up the pace in the latter part where things get more serious.  
Both main character's are struggling from a conspiracyBoth stories are awesome! 
The protagonists believe that they're in a conspiracy, also most of the time they're in a room and many references. A good show can offer you these series. 
Delusional otaku protagonists that believe that a secret organization is conspiring against them, with realistic colors and characters designs, and some drama and romance.  "
1210,30,14,"Both have themes about loneliness and are great psychological dramas.If that's what your looking for you should definitely watch NGE. That's only one of many reasons though. 
The premier anime psychological drama. Welcome to the NHK takes many cues from the Evangelion school of psychological exposition and character deconstruction, and any viewer with a taste for such things would do well to check out both. 
Both are about main character's spiritual wounds.  
Based on psychological and social themes. 
At their core, Welcome to the NHK and Neon Genesis Evangelion are both criticisms of otaku culture and the lonely anti-social existance that otaku live. (Although NHK is more about hikkikomori, it still has quite a lot to say about otaku.)NHK gives an accurate portrayal of hikkikomori/otaku life; if you are at all anti-social, you'll understand that the characters of NHK are among the most realistic you'll find from television. It certainly helps that the author of the original light novel was a hikkikomori himself.Evangelion on the other hand, is just huge ball of contempt and anger directed at otaku culture, and it really wouldn't be much of a stretch to say that whole message of the show was ""Fuck you, you're life sucks.""NHK also has a bittersweet atmosphere to it, whereas Evangelion is downright depressing.None the less, if you are fascinated by the psychology surrounding otaku culture, both of these shows are a must see. read more 
The themes of self-worth, escapism and communication are explored in both of these shows.  
If you enjoyed the psychological elements of Neon Genesis Evangelion, this is a great next stop. 
Both are psychological anime that deal with depression. The main character in both have a strong desire to 'run away' from the problems facing them. Neon Genesis Evangelion is considerably harder to digest than NHK. It is recommended both be watched without reading to much about them, both are good, just go watch them.  
Both anime contain subjects, like depression, loneliness, portrayed by a screwed-up and emotionally broken character cast. NHK takes a rather realistic approach, even if both can become extremly depressing. 
If Welcome to the NHK appealed to you, so will, most likely, Neon Genesis Evangelion (NGE). At first glance, it might look like both anime don't have that much in common, but they really do. While NHK shows how Sato's shut-in lifestyle leads to depression, anxiety and borderline insanity, NGE takes a different approach, but beneath this the topics stay the same. The way the portagonist Shinji and the other EVA kids are essentially forced in the whole situation preludes the dark and sombre climax and overall theme. Misaki's and Sato's relationship is, at some points, very similar to the one between Shinji and Asuka. In both, the feelings of self-hatred, angst and despair, the grim look ahead, and especially in NGE, the past experiences and strained relationships, play a vital role and find display in some of the most grieving moments of the shows.NGE offers a completely different setting, but it deals with the same feelings and emotions that are depicted by NHK, albeit with a somewhat more violent and surreal touch. read more 
These anime are vastly different from each other.  One is about Mechs and the other one is about being a NEET.  But they both have the same ""psychological"" elements to them. For Example, they both deal with depression, self-worth, E.T.C. (pretty much they're both depressing). after watching this show(or both) I recommend you to watch shows that isn't as dark as this. They really set you back to reality's dark side.    Thanks to that I kind of reflected on my life a little bit  
Both are great character studies of those who suffer from depression. 
Both shows deals with a main character who is somewhat lost , doesn't know what they wanted to do . In both the stories the MC progresses slowly . While nhk deals with shut - in Main character who with the help of people around them starts to appreciate life. NGA deals with MC who has now something only he can do which gives his life a purpose.

1210,329,8,"Although the plots are very different, a theme in Planetes seems to be fear of isolation. It's the only other show I can think of besides N.H.K. that seems to have captured a very 'real' quality in its characters' fear, motivations, weaknesses and behaviors. Very complex in terms of not seeming overwrought or artificial and keeping a healthy dose of humor (like N.h.K.) in the show. 
I can't tell you that these shows are similar, because they aren't. But after watching Planetes, then NHK, I can say that I got the same feeling I got while watching Planetes. In the end they were both highly enjoyable, and overall both were top notch.  
Both Planetes and NHK delve deep into peoples emotions and struggles, but what they truly share in common, besides their atmosphere or ""vibe"", is the feeling of loneliness. While NHK is more focused on the social isolation and mental health problems of its characters, Planetes uses the loneliness of the characters as a way to showcase their struggles and goals in life, without ever actually exploring the subject of mental health. There's indeed an arc in the story where they do this, but only as a way to make the character further develop during the show, instead of being the whole focus of it. 
tl;dr Planetes is the only other anime that gives me the Welcome to the NHK ""feels"".Welcome to the NHK is very unique, so unique that there's really nothing like it in terms of story. Planetes has a very different story, setting, atmosphere, and  characters, but both are deep anime that evoke feelings of isolation, loneliness, helplessness, and loss, while also making you laugh, giving you hope, and telling an awesome story.  
Both stories reveal the theme of human feelings, especially loneliness. In addition, Ai Tanabe sometimes looks and behaves like a Misaki Nakahara. 
Both delve into the topic of loneliness, isolation, and the mental horrors that naturally follow such states of living. 
A sense of quirkiness, attention to characters, some romantic development and investigation to psychological issues. Both Planetes and NHK deal with psychological issues present within there independent settings, whilst also containing a similar quirky sense of humour. Planetes differs as a Sci-fi with a much larger cast of characters, whilst also divulging into political and societal issues. While NHK divulges much deeper into a variety of psychological issues present within the constraints of ones home, whilst also presenting a particularly dark sense of humour. If you like one for its focus on characters, investigation into relevant issues and quirky atmosphere, you'll be sure to like the other. read more 
Welcome to the NHK is a dramatic and psychological love story that centers around a group of NEETS with various social disorders and traumas. Throughout the story, the characters learn to accept themselves and the ones around them and try to fit in society. The story has its share of comedy, depressing, inspiring and heart-warming moments. Planetes gives you the same feel, as its story manages to mix romance, drama, comedy and a bit of psychology just like Welcome to the NHK. Planetes plot main focus is on the expansion of humankind into space and all the issues surrounding it, however just like NHK, throughout the adventure, you get to know the main and side characters to an intimate and psychological level and all their backgrounds and motivations to go into space, where in NHK you get the dark backgrounds and reasons why the characters can't function correctly in society.Space is a vast place and it can be very lonely if you don't have someone alongside you. In essence, both anime deal with isolation and social integration and are incredibly inspiring in their own way. The setting might be different, but it doesn't matter where a human being goes, he'll still need social interaction or he'll eventually break.Beautiful looking and a great OST to boot, these anime are a roller-coaster of emotions that might make you cry, laugh, have a good time, feel depressed, or even inspired. read more "
1210,9989,7,"Both shows have main characters suffer from social withdrawal and have flashbacks showing them during happier times.

Hikikomori, young adults who withdraw from social life, often seeking extreme degrees of isolation and confinement.

Both feature a shut-in who dropped out of school as the main character. Both have surreal lead female characters trying to reach a goal with the main character. Both flashes back to happier times many times throughout the series. Both are very emotional shows.

If you like the Independent movie-like feel of NHK, then check out Beck: Mongolian Chop Squad a show about a band that takes the world by storm.

1210,28851,4,"Both anime deal with the theme of suicide, as well as a male character being regretful of his hurtful actions towards a vulnerable female character. 
Both are drama dealing with MC's incapability to connect with other peopleBoth feature various people from their pasts bearing importance for their character developments.Koe no Katachi does have way more recent art techniques (and way bigger budget), while NHK ni Youkoso! is recognizably a decade older. 
If you like the realism which characterize NHK ni Youkoso, you will probably enjoy Koe no Katachi. Both also tackle social problems such as suicide, bullying and isolation. Koe no Katachi is the first anime that satisfied me since I've watched NHK ni Youkoso.  
As many have said before Welcome to the NHK is pretty similar to Koe no Katachi. Both of them deal with the issues of social anxiety, suicide and isolation. Although KnK is a bit lighter both of them are just as depressing.If you liked Koe no Katachi you'll definitely like NHK. "

Both tackle the bleakness of being a NEET with an agoraphobic MC trying to face the outside world. "
1210,31043,2,"They're similar in how both of the main characters are isolated from most people and often have inner narrations throughout the story. They both have events in their past that are often brought up and are relevant to the plot. They share psychological and seinen genres, which makes them feel similar as well. Not to mention, both series deal with very dark topics, like suicide (NHK) and kidnapping (ERASED). 
NHK ni Youkoso! and Boku dake ga Inai Machi are both, in my opinion, moving psychological thrillers. Both shows share deep, underlying thematic content that unifies the plot in a meticulous yet exceptional way. Additionally, both shows share an extremely dark tone due to plot elements such as murder (ERASED) and suicide (NHK) present. As for the main male lead in both shows, both characters have to face their past head-on in order to move forward in life. They are also portrayed rather realistically (i.e. not an anime archetype) and can be relatable to a niche of the general population. If any of these appeal to you, I would recommend checking out the other series when you get a chance. read more "
1210,245,2,"Both series have about the same comedy-drama ratio (well at least for the first half of NHK, it later turns to mostly drama). Both also deal with many serious issues, but never fail to deliver on humor either. Also both series have something other comedies usually don't, a heart. There's a real heart to them both. Also both series have some pervy humor in them, but also other types as well.  Also I just think both series would apeal to the same type of person. There is a difference however. NHK relies on a lot of dark homor, and turns into more of a drama then anything else, and it;s truly for the better. It becomes a much better show for it. GTO doesn't use dark humor, and never really turns into a drama, but it does get a little more serious as it goes on.  read more 
Both of them have similar points, except that NHK is more dramatic, and has more painful parts to watch, when GTO is more of the funny side. GTO is definitely a must-watch for all you psychological lovers who want to watch something that doesn't feel like wasting time. You might find yourself looking 20 episodes straight. Well.. thats what happened to me on both anime. ^ ^ "

338,820,9,"Though the content is significantly different (a space opera as opposed to a story on the French Revolution), the presentation and themes are very much similar. Political corruption—especially within the aristocracy—is a major theme in both titles. Both sides of the conflict are never portrayed as being intrinsically good or bad: there are only circumstances. Some parallels also exist within the characters; for example the relationship between Oscar and Andre resembling that of Reinhard and Kircheis. 
Legend Of Galactic Heroes may not be a shoujo like Rose Of Versailles so the romantic aspect is missing, but pretty much everything else about the series are similar, I may risk and say that LOGH went to take some aspects and influences of Rose, mainly the political and social critic of the aristocracy. The dramatic aspect and overall feeling throughout the series are pretty similar too not to speak that even the narrator has the same feel. 
Completely different plotwise but similar in nature. LoGH is a fictional space opera while Rose of Versailles is about the French Revolution. Yet both have a political background and deal with corruption and the consequences thereof in their own setting. There's a great cast of both main and side characters who develop from fairly unknown to people with massive influence. Moreover, the relationship between Reinhard and Kircheis is similar to that of Oscar and André. 
there isn't much that comapred to logh in terms of plot, but Rose of Versailles holds up if you enjoy classical series that involve politics, corruption, and ambiguous themes of good/bad. even if it's kinda shoujo 
Aristocracy-centric political dramas that make use of headstrong characters, an extensive setting, and smart presentation, carrying a very old-fashioned flair throughout.  
The two anime definitely have the same vibe and possess common main themes like corruption, political systems clashing and the fight for democracy by some party of the story.Rose of Versailles OST also reminded me of LotGH and the animation also holds some similarities despite the different periods they were animated.The time periods the stories happens is very different but holds many similar social and moral problems.The main characters develop a lot through the two long anime and change their minds at some time, most characters are not one-dimensional and they learn with their mistakes.Both anime are almost like animated documentaries of war. If you like to see what happens behind the curtains of war instead of just witnessing the action, who's plotting, scheming and commanding the troops, look no further. read more 
2 spectacular series rife with political intrigue, conspiracies and war. One thing I find incredible between both series is how important even minor characters become later in the series. They're both incredibly unpredictable yet each event occurs as the result of logical consequences to characters' actions. Though I think Ginga is more impressive in this regard, due to it being entirely fictional, it is still rather impressive how Versailles manages to pull off this unpredictable plot despite us all knowing the fate of many of the major characters.e.g King Louis and Antoinette.The main difference between these series is Ginga feels more focused on its thesis regarding the role of governance in a sci fi setting, however, Versailles has more of a focus on romance. I would say both are equally great. I would say every anime fan should watch these series at some point. read more 
Both share many similar themes, especially between the political intrigue from Reinhard's perspective in the Galactic Empire in the first half of LotGH, and Rose of Versailles, including some subplots that are similar. Both also share an incredibly similar narration style where a third-person narrator narrates and foreshadows certain events in the plot. The main protagonist from both also look similar, particularly between Reinhard von Lohengramm, and Oscar François.  
VnB and LotGH both take place in the aristocratic worlds of a feudal, military empire. The first 25 episodes of LotGH and VnB's plot and vibe are very similar, both depicting the downfall of corrupt feudal regimes disrespecting ordinary citizen. Both glorify 19th century values such as chivalry, honor, while limiting those to an aristocratic elite. Both are historical, with LotGH emphasizing this more (despite being fake history unlike VnB). VnB is far more emotional due to intended target audience (shoujo) and prominently has romance. "
338,33,5,"Both are reasonably serious shows with a focus on political intrigue, back-stabbing nobles and how cruel people can be. But Berserk is set in a fantasy universe with demons and monsters, with a lot of battles, whilst RoV is a historical anime that takes place in France, documenting the beginnings of the French Revolution.Also, Griffith looks awfully similar to Lady Oscar (all that long, fluffy hair...) 
While Berserk is a fantasy anime and Rose of Versailles is more focused on romance, both have to do with political intrigue, nobility's schemes, betrayals and kingdoms in crisis. Miura, the author of Berserk has stated that Rose of Versailles has been one of the many inspirations behind his writing. 
While Berserk is much bloodier than Rose of Versailles, both series are about a nation in conflict (the nation in Berserk is in war, the nation in Rose of Versailles is on the verge of war). Both put focus on the backstabbing that happens within the nobility on a regular basis (this plays center stage in Rose of Versailles and takes a very important back seat in Berserk). Neither series shy away from showing the harsh truths of life. Berserk has the ""rich people are awful"" perspective shown from soldiers, with Rose of Versailles has the ""rich people are awful"" perspective shown through rich people. If I'm not mistaken, Kentaro Miura cited Rose of Versailles as influence on the political aspect of Berserk.If you're looking for a good drama about crisis, look into these two series. read more 
Both are war stories with characters who you get to see grow througout their lives. Berserk is obviously more fantastical, but both focus on the human element of war, and let you see the gruesomness that happens from all perspectives. 
From what I've read about Berserk's creator, Kentaro Miura, Berserk is essentially the world's best and most popular piece of Ladyhawk/Rose of Versailles/Fist of the North Star crossover fanfiction, with bits of Devilman thrown in. The golden age arc, which the original Berserk series adapts, borrows heavily from the motifs and character archetypes of Versailles no Bara, and even as a casual viewer, I can see the parallels, particularly if one has also seen the relatively obscure film Ladyhawk, of which Miura is a professed fan.Essentially, if you liked the golden age arc of Berserk, you'll probably like Versailles no Bara, and vice versa. Berserk is bloodier, and features slightly less in the way of shojo tropes, owing to its fusion of shonen elements into its manga 'DNA', but they're very similar in most ways that I feel matter. read more "
338,13125,1,"The major plot point for both shows is that there's something amiss in their respective societies; they explore morality and those who have power over everyone else. Characters' relationships with each other are important and both somewhat explore sexuality/gender identity in the context of their societies.Despite having very different settings (Versailles being a show from the 70s about historical events while Shinsekai is newer and takes place in the future), care went into the world building of both. "
30,2001,29,"With a highly diverse cast that is both well rounded and lovable and a story line that continues to expand and evolve. The classic Evangelion is worth you time if you appreciated the story telling that Gainax can do so well and aren't afraid to think a little. 
Same animation studio, similar spontaneous kinds of moments. Both are based around mecha and have out-of-this-world enemies. Just, Gurren Lagann has drills and that lovely yellow moped. 
Imagine Evangelion if Shinji finally stops being reluctant, mans up, and kicks the **** out of every thing in his way, and a lot less mindf***ery.  That's Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann.  It is an Incredibly awesome Kick-reason-to-the-curb anime that leaves you so full of energy that you feel like yelling for 2 hours after watching the final battle.  Yeah, it's that awesome. 
They're both mecha series from Gainax, and that's where the similarities end, but that's really the point. Evangelion is a deconstruction of mecha anime, basically saying, ""You know how all those other mecha series made piloting a giant robot look fun? Well I'll show you how miserable it can really be."" Gurren Lagann is a reconstruction; a decade later, saying, ""You know how those mecha deconstruction series made piloting a giant robot look really awful? Well I'll show you how AWESOME it can really be!"" The persistent despair of the former and unshakable optimism of the latter make excellent counterpoints and contrast beautifully. 
Both are seminal must-watch mecha series from Gainax. But they are not similar--rather they should be watched because they contrast so well. Whereas TTGL boasts over-the-top action and is an all-around fun show, NGE goes down to the nitty gritty of piloting mechas, and is ultimately psychological and somewhat depressive. Both shows are also complemented by very nicely developed characters. 
Evangelion is known for its artistic command of scale and its ability to express a sense of enormity, contrasted with physical and psychological isolation, has yet to be surpassed in all Art. Only Gurren Lagann has transcended the physical sense of scale of Eva. The iconic climax of End of Evangelion may have been influenced by the animation of Macross Plus. 
NGE is in many ways the ""evil twin"" of TTGL. Made by the same production company (Gainax) back in the 1990's, it starts out as a somewhat-normal super-robot show. However, it eventually becomes a brutal deconstruction of the entire super-robot genre. Featuring a pathologically-passive protagonist, his eternally distant father, and a whole cast of other very flawed characters, NGE is just as much a psychological character study as it is an action show. Overall, it is very dark, a total mindscrew, and likely will leave you with a lot of questions and a somewhat uneasy feeling.I'd recommend watching NGE BEFORE you watch TTGL, because the latter will provide the catharsis you will desperately need after watching the former. Where NGE deconstructs the genre, TTGL REconstructs it gloriously. They should be watched in that order, and not the other way around. read more 
First of all, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is kind of like a parody of Neon Genesis Evangelion. Both Series have a protagonist with similar personalities (Simon/Shinji), and both shows have similar looking Mechas (Lazengann/EVA 01).They are both made by Studio Gainax.Neon Genesis Evangelion is  ""darker"", more serious compared to Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. I recommend watching Neon Genesis Evangelion first, then Gurren Lagann. 
Both are Gainex mecha anime in which a young teenager must step up to pilot a giant mecha and use it to fight enemies on a colossal scale to save humanity. 
Both protagonists are self-conscious boys that fight for their lives in mech battles. One has a role model to reassure him when his self-loathing gets the best of him while the other does not. 
It's like Neon Genesis Evangelion but with Shinji actually GETTING IN THE ROBOT most of the time and undergoing hardcore character development into one of the most badass characters EVER. OH AND DRILLS. 
GURREN LAGANN IS THE OPPOSITE OF NEON GENESIS. Ok, you might be confused, as they are opposite there are some similarities, both follow a wimpy push over gifted with a powerful machine and must save the world, but that's where they diverge. While Neon Genesis is a mecha that's very depressing and serious; rooted in heavy themes. TTGL takes a more light hearted and energetic approach to mecha world. Its interesting to see how the series mirror each other, especially since they are both produced by the same company. 
Gurren Lagann is a whole different kind of mecha. If you like evangelion but are looking for slightly more modern art and in my opinion a better plot, then Lagann is for you.  
I recommend this anime because all their episodes are good, do not have a boring episode is action from beginning to end, is must watch it. 
This is how NGE would end up if Shinji had a role model or someone who was with him to guide him while growing up. Definetly better to watch this after Evangelion as you can truly see both paths bad and good in persons development in adolescence. 
Two productions of Gainax studio, and although they are very different from each other, also have some similarities as the Mecha theme, although Evangelion focuses more on the psychological genre, since TTGL focuses more on action. 
I don't know why, but these series are very similar, at least for me. Main charater is similar to other one. If you watched Neon Genesis Evangelion and liked it, go ahead and watch Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann too. 
If you liked Gurren Lagann, you have to watch Evangelion.I mean Evangelion is the father of mecha anime, it is a must watch for mecha lovers. 
At first glance, Neon Genesis Evangelion and Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann have very little in common. Yes, both are highly regarded mecha shows, and yes, both were created by studio Gainax. That, however, is pretty much where the similarities end.Evangelion takes an unforgiving, almost cynical look at the common and widespread premise of many mecha shows - various circumstances forcing teenagers to pilot giant robots in deadly battles. While this wasn't exactly unique at the time, the show deservedly became a classic with its masterful direction and great depth, when exploring the psychology of its cast.12 years later, TTGL came out, and it was nothing like it. In fact, it was more similiar to Diebuster, another mecha show by Gainax, in its use of over-the-top action and a likeable set of characters. From the beginning, it feels like an antithesis to everything NGE stands for and as it progresses, it executes on this feeling perfectly.So, have you watched NGE and feel the void after one of the most iconic endings of anime? Do you love it when Gainax goes crazy and brings us a show that exceeds all expectations? Then look no further. Watch Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. You will not regret it. read more 
Mecha on a more serious note with a more seriously themed plot; a good mecha to also have on your watch list hand-in-hand with Gurren Lagann. 
The two are masterpieces created by Gainax, Good art, Good characters, Good world construction, etc 
The only similarity is the mecha. I'd mostly recommend this if you want a complete tonal shift. In many ways, this anime is the anti-Evangelion, foregoing the introspection and despair of humanity's collective fate that Eva presents for a spectacle of the highest order. Gurren Lagann is both mindless and thought-provoking, with a core message that power comes from within, championing the indomitable spirit of the spiral races xD. 
In many ways, Gurren Lagann was a response to NGE. Both similar in how they influenced the industry and a genre into something else; one was a psychoanalytical work on the human condition and the other was a character study on what it means to do the right thing! Watch them! 
Mecha battlesMC is a whiny bitchEVA is an epic show and you need to watch it 
Both of them have an amazing plot for mecha genre. Also they have great character development. The fighting scenes for all moments are very emotional. The most interesting thing about this anime is the drama that can make you feel a little sympathetic. It's worth to watch 
The two pillars of mecha. Classic shows, except one happens to have a lot less existential depression. If Evangelion is about recognizing the importance of love for yourself and others, Gurren Lagann is about breaking the perceived limitations that trap us in order to develop our best selves and achieve the impossible. Watch these masterpieces. They were both made by Gainax (when they were still genius) anyway. 
Mecha anime with a story line that continues to evolve. Similar animation studio, the protagonist have similar personalities, basically they're young teenagers that must step up to pilot a giant mecha and use it to fight against colossal monsters! Evangelion is more darker in turns of the plot and the tone, but they are both entertaining to watch. 
Both are mecha anime where a group of people has to fight certain species using giant robots in order to achieve that group's ultimate goal. 
If you like trauma and giant mechs fighting tthan you will love those "
30,16498,29,"Many have linked Attack on Titan to Evangelion since long before AoT's anime came to be, for highly spoilerific (NOT MECHA) reasons. To be slightly less vague, Eva deconstructed the feel good / manly / heroic mecha genre with a combination of depression and tragedy. And, to a lesser extent, AoT went against the flow of shounen fighting cliches/tropes enough to make it stand out in the same way. So, both series' differences from the norm makes them comparable, in essence. Unlike in its manga, near the end (ep24) AoT's anime had Eren act very much like Shinji from Eva: needing a peptalk and FULL EPISODE of agonizing to... do what was required. And - also anime only - then came ep25 with the most obvious Eva reference I've seen: a character standing watching a battle of gigantic proportions, an arm flying off towards him and blood splattering; his reaction being the same non-reaction as Gendo's in Eva. Whether the AoT anime team did these things well aware of the Eva similarities in order to add more meat to the Eva-AoT argument, I know not. But it isn't the first time a popular anime was referenced: a character does her very best Kira impression in ep23--the director of both Death Note and AoT being one and the same. read more 
Both series revolve around Humanity trying to fight powerful enemies they don't quite understand, and young people are forced to take up the fight. Tragic events are common occurrences. giant humanoids are used to fight. Shingeki likely was heavily inspired by Evangelion. 
The humanity is trying to survive an attack of almighty titans, after episode 8 there are more similarities... 
Mankind is in the brink of elimination as mysterious creatures suddenly come from unknown origins to end their existence.The only hope for man is in the hands of a young boy who has the ability to control a power equal to these mysterious creatures.This power is not easily controlled however as the boy at times allows this ability to go berserk as he encounters emotionally driven situations.Epic battles occur as the boy controls this power to combat these enormous titans amongst a ruined city.The question is, am I describing Shingeki no Kyojin or Evangelion? However, as in my case, if you absolutely love one, you most definitely will love the other. While watching, my mouth was usually down in utter shock throughout each episode with both of these works of art. read more 
Both are similar with a very dark tone and focus on the human condition. Attack on titan focus more on existentialism and ethics. It also is action heavy; the visuals alone make it a good watch. Whereas Evangelion focuses on mental illness and transhumanism. Evangelion tends to be lighter on action and violence. However it covers much more mature content and isn't far more disturbing. 
Humanity unites against monstrosities.  Shingeki feels like Medieval Evangelion sometimes.  Evangelion has more depression, Shingeki has more despair.   
Both deal with earth being under attack by monsters (titans and angels), both have young people who are tasked with protecting it, the main characters both have difficult relationships with their fathers. 
Some unknown origin creatures invaded humanity, both are constantly fighting a losing battle while human trying to survive. 
Both series deal with ambiguous creatures that threaten all of humanity, a young protagonist with a connection to said creatures, and have a more of a realistic take on their respective genres. 
This seems to already be a popular recommendation, so I""ll be brief:Both have...-giant monsters that have almost wiped out all of humanity.-organizations set to wipe out those said monsters.-a lot of plot twists that (more so in SnK's case) leave you hanging in a cruel way.-utterly messed up and convoluted stories and characters.They are both anime that have messed up my brain in a good way, and I love Evangelion and Kyojin for that. 
Humanity is in despair and they are fighting with the very things they want to kill. 
Humanity fights back against giant mononstrosities that threaten to wipe out the human race. Both are exciting anime with plenty of action in addition to beautiful visuals, but each has a different setting and focus. AoT is a dark fantasy with a greater focus on mystery and world-building, while Evangelion is more of a psychological thriller that uses its modern day sci-fi/mech setting as the backdrop. 
I would go far as to say the Shingeki no Kyojin does have it far share of similarites to Neon Genesis Evangelion. Behind all the window dressing, the to show are quite similar if you think about.Both stories take place in a post post apocalyptic world meaning the apocalyspe had already has prior to the series start and that the world is slowing rebuilding from said apocalypse and have devise ways against their oppression since. Humanity is own falling legs in spite of oppressive and enigmatic enemy. In Neon Genesis Evangelion the oppressive force is the Angels. In Attack on Titan its the titular Titans.The main character learns he is the only able to pilot a giant robot. In Neon Genesis Evangelion, Shinji pilots the Eva Unit 01. In Attack on Titan, Eren is able to turn into the Rogue Titan. The Rogue Titan is even introduced very similar to Eva Unit 01 in almost every way. It even goes berserk several times in the story.Both weapon on the key to turning the tides of the war in their favor.The two show also have very similar atmosphere being both dark and brooding. In both series, mankind is in fear of its enemy knowing little to nothing about them. The enemy is numerous and only get stronger after each encounter.In both series, the character are severely flawed and are by no means ideal.In both series, the humanity's enemy is not whom they are fighting against but it is themselves.I say if you like one you are bound to find to something to like in the other. read more 
fight for survival of human race, very hard to kill enemies, lost of psychology what do you want more lol 
Attack on titan focuses on fighting with superior (Titans) beings and retaking the walls. Neon Genesis focuses by defending their city by superior (Angels)  beings  from causing 3rd Impatct (end of the world), while neon genesis does character development very well with everyone being depressed, Attack on Titans tries to by brining male tears. 
SNK and NGE may have a very different fanbases, but when it comes down to it, there are many things that are similar about these two series. SNK and NGE are series that both revolve around a young both trying to save his city/town/world from giant monsters. Even though the devices used to destroy these monsters are different (three dimensional maneuver devices in SNK, giant human-operated machines in NGE)There are also three teenage characters who are pressured to do a lot of risky work in order to save their city/town/world. Although the I believe that that Shinji, Misato, and Rei and better written characters with more complexity and depth to their stories, both series feature strong leads that are (at least in my opinion) the stand out quality of these series and are part of what makes them unique.  read more 
The three main characters in each show are very similar. Both main characters have fathers who abandoned them at a young age, and their mother also died when they were young. Both have a group of ""monsters"" (Titans and Angels) that humans have to fight against in order to survive as a species. Both of these shows are also very dark and psychological.  
Both are set in a post-apocalyptic world with enemy's that are far superior in strength to our protagonists with a teenage boy as the lead protagonist. Both anime have strong sets of female characters in it's cast, and the main protagonist's father in both anime shows no interest in their son's lives. 
Both of these shows have similar setup where humanity is in danger because of strong enemy that's trying to push humans to extinction. There is mystery behind those attacks.Action in both shows is exciting and well executed. 
SnK and Evangelion, two series mainstream and almost cult, where they possess these similarities:- Postapocalyptic world dominated by a superior species (Titans in SnK and Angeles in EVA), that caused the destruction of humans.- A group specializes in defending humans from these monsters.- The protagonist is entrusted with a power similar to that of the angels and is almost forced / manipulated to participate in this mortal battle, where he will be the only one able to turn the situation. Where he spent the whole series questioning himself and how everything works around him. In addition they lost their mother and their father is very distant to him, which is responsible for their ability.- Humanity lives locked in a place built for its own protection.- There is a secret kept by they most powerful of the city, about the origin of these monsters. read more 
-Teenagers are given the responsibility of defending humanity-Both have a superior life form attacking humanity (Angels, Titans)-Similar main characters (Asuka = Eren, Rei = Mikasa, Shinji = Armin) 
Both survival assumptions,But this show does not focus on the psychological of its characters and the characters have super powers. 
Both serries happens in the end of humanity,  both have characters with similar aspects and both have fights  which the mc against giant ""monsters"" 
While I'm not a fan of Shingeki no Kyojin (and Neon Genesis Evangelion is obviously my favorite anime) these two have some in common. They both have a cowardly main character, they both are about defending humanity from something, etc. 
Both series follow young people who are recruited into a military organization dedicated to fighting colossal beings that threaten humanity. Connections between humans and these enemies are explored as well as the enormous losses incurred while fighting them. 
Humanity tries to survive the attack of monstrous creatures 
Thematics are similar. Catasthrophic worlds, with a twisted inside story, and a lot of misteries to solve. The protagonist are a bit similar in their personalities. I don't know what much else to say. It's great, okay? 
they both giant humanoids 
It sucked at first,but after the mystery begins,in the end,it's all makes sense... "
30,1575,15,"both have mecha both are deep in different ways and surpass the standard mecha anime  
The most obvious common theme between the two is the use of mecha.  The two anime have the exact same type of design for their mechas.Both really just have the same feel in terms of themes, too. 
Code Geass and Neon Genesis Evangelion are both high quality, riveting, mecha anime. Both series deal with politics, warfare, and psychology. They both discuss subjects such as human nature, the meaning of life and happiness, and sorrow and insanity. Both anime have fantastic soundtracks, great voice acting, and beautiful, sharp artwork.Both anime also contain much symbolism, some drawing its roots from religious symbols (although this is much more prevalent in Evangelion).Both of these anime have very memorable characters and great development.*Both are highly recommended.  
First off. There's a lot to what makes Evangelion and Code Geass similar.1. Obviously both series have Mechas and are piloted.2. Shinji and Lelouch are protagonists with psychological and emotional conflict. Both have daddy issues and are haunted by dark pasts and have ideals.3. Rei and C.C. Emotionless girls with serious importance to the story.4. Kallen and Asuka. Both hot headed girls with troubled pasts.5. Enemies and organizations like SEELE, Britannia, Nerv, Black Knights etc.6. Sci-fi elements like Angels, Geass, Eva's, Knightmares.7. Similar themes. Topics about human nature, what's right and wrong. Some symbolic scenes, Justice, psychological topics, secrets and conspiracy.In conclusion. Both are a must watch quality Anime's. Can't miss out on both. read more 
It's related do to the fact that each character running a different robot has a meaning and only certain people can use such robots and they are working for an organization to stop them. 
What can i say about these anime!Epic plot, amazing characters, memorable moments...Masterpieces that everyone should see.Mecha, action, drama,... 
They both have Giant Fighting Robots and hot girls. 
Both are a coming-of-age story following the development of a central male character; a battle to save humanity/society from a menacing group of marauding giant monsters 
The deconstruction genre is present in allot of anime for primarily short periods of time.Code Geass has allot of elements and feelings that represent Evangelion in a few ways. Although, the protagonist differ from one another, both Evangelion and Code Geass come very close in the long term for just general deconstruction in the anime's themselves.  
Both of these shows are excellent psychological animes. The mechas in both are insanely epic. One other similarity I found is that both have the monumental choice of accepting or rejecting God 
Apart from the obvious mech aspect, they're both highly intelligent animes that are full of mystery, often doing things you didn't expect. They both have a very 'grand' nature to them, slowly moving up from a small contained world story into something that blows all proportions out of the water. Both being a ride from start to finish, they both seem to have a very well thought out story structure, as well as the occasional comedic episode to keep things balanced. 
Too many Neon Genesis Evangelion fans make the mistake of not immersing themselves in Code Geass, which is objectively better than this show. It's a hard bar to set with Evangelion being so good and so inspirational in pop culture, but if you weren't huge on the hidden messages in Evangelion and more its psychological and action elements, Code Geass is a masterpiece every evangelion fan will adore. 
While both my seem to be a mech show on the surface about a teen both have many philosophy’s behind them and show much more depth than you think of a typical mech show as both have very psychological themes between one another. That being said both shows are brilliantly done well and are very enjoyable to watch and both have very good cast of characters and drama to go with one another and both shows have great action scenes that complement each other well. 
it really messes with your head in a simualre way and its hard to choose which is better out of the two for me 
The series are both brilliant and depressed. "
30,1210,14,"Both have themes about loneliness and are great psychological dramas.If that's what your looking for you should definitely watch NGE. That's only one of many reasons though. 
The premier anime psychological drama. Welcome to the NHK takes many cues from the Evangelion school of psychological exposition and character deconstruction, and any viewer with a taste for such things would do well to check out both. 
Both are about main character's spiritual wounds.  
Based on psychological and social themes. 
At their core, Welcome to the NHK and Neon Genesis Evangelion are both criticisms of otaku culture and the lonely anti-social existance that otaku live. (Although NHK is more about hikkikomori, it still has quite a lot to say about otaku.)NHK gives an accurate portrayal of hikkikomori/otaku life; if you are at all anti-social, you'll understand that the characters of NHK are among the most realistic you'll find from television. It certainly helps that the author of the original light novel was a hikkikomori himself.Evangelion on the other hand, is just huge ball of contempt and anger directed at otaku culture, and it really wouldn't be much of a stretch to say that whole message of the show was ""Fuck you, you're life sucks.""NHK also has a bittersweet atmosphere to it, whereas Evangelion is downright depressing.None the less, if you are fascinated by the psychology surrounding otaku culture, both of these shows are a must see. read more 
The themes of self-worth, escapism and communication are explored in both of these shows.  
If you enjoyed the psychological elements of Neon Genesis Evangelion, this is a great next stop. 
Both are psychological anime that deal with depression. The main character in both have a strong desire to 'run away' from the problems facing them. Neon Genesis Evangelion is considerably harder to digest than NHK. It is recommended both be watched without reading to much about them, both are good, just go watch them.  
Both anime contain subjects, like depression, loneliness, portrayed by a screwed-up and emotionally broken character cast. NHK takes a rather realistic approach, even if both can become extremly depressing. 
If Welcome to the NHK appealed to you, so will, most likely, Neon Genesis Evangelion (NGE). At first glance, it might look like both anime don't have that much in common, but they really do. While NHK shows how Sato's shut-in lifestyle leads to depression, anxiety and borderline insanity, NGE takes a different approach, but beneath this the topics stay the same. The way the portagonist Shinji and the other EVA kids are essentially forced in the whole situation preludes the dark and sombre climax and overall theme. Misaki's and Sato's relationship is, at some points, very similar to the one between Shinji and Asuka. In both, the feelings of self-hatred, angst and despair, the grim look ahead, and especially in NGE, the past experiences and strained relationships, play a vital role and find display in some of the most grieving moments of the shows.NGE offers a completely different setting, but it deals with the same feelings and emotions that are depicted by NHK, albeit with a somewhat more violent and surreal touch. read more 
These anime are vastly different from each other.  One is about Mechs and the other one is about being a NEET.  But they both have the same ""psychological"" elements to them. For Example, they both deal with depression, self-worth, E.T.C. (pretty much they're both depressing). after watching this show(or both) I recommend you to watch shows that isn't as dark as this. They really set you back to reality's dark side.    Thanks to that I kind of reflected on my life a little bit  
Both are great character studies of those who suffer from depression. 
Both shows deals with a main character who is somewhat lost , doesn't know what they wanted to do . In both the stories the MC progresses slowly . While nhk deals with shut - in Main character who with the help of people around them starts to appreciate life. NGA deals with MC who has now something only he can do which gives his life a purpose.

Well the main story does not have nothing in common. However both have a high psychological side. Maybe Death Note don't touch you as much as Neon Genesis Evangelion, but stills a great anime and will certainly worth your watching. Both also focus in the ""God"" word, but in different perspectives. :)Death Note focus more in a psychological fight, and NGE in feelings and unique characters.Ending, I would also say that both touch the theme ""change the world"". 
both will leave you thinking.trust me, if you liked one you will most probably like the other. 
Complex and interesting plot with many twists. 
HUGE amount of psychological disturbance, especially as the stories progress. It may not be evident for the first 4-5 episodes, but it requires a large amount of memory talent and controlled thinking to process what's going on. If you don't like it, it's likely because you don't GET it. If you can't get it, read spoilers, it's no shame to do so. All in all, these are both SUPERB anime. 
The fact that Death Note needs to be:1.Seen more than once to fully grasp the intricacies of actions, and the heavily focused mind battles of twisted magnitudes of complexity.2.Forces you to concentrate on the text and dialogue going on, or else,easily makes it a strong recommendation to Neon Genesis Evangelion universe.Both are a masterpiece on their own  "
30,5114,6,"Although as a genre, they are different but deconstruct them they are truly very similar. Both supposedly anime that are aimed for boys, both transcend their genre by providing plot narratives that tackle universal issues that slowly become personal as the both series progress. 
They're bouth about a force that goes to God, but Neon Genesis is about mecha and FMA is about alchemy... 
FMA Brotherhood and Evangelion have a lot of common discussions through their development: the value of human life, human communication, the confrontation with god, moral and ethics, life and death... Both are great works of art that have humanistic messages and deep philosofical thoughts, and, for that, both are a must see 
Both have symbolisms and philosophies. 
Both, with religious symbolism and humanistic philosophies, are anime with a lot of plot twists and small personal problems raised to huge conflicts of great scale, one through mecha, and the other through alchemy.  
Both are anime full of action and epic scenes, while at the same time dealing with philosophical themes. Both series also share similar symbolism and characters. "
30,43,6,"They are both extremely dark anime.  They're both futuristic (in different ways) and both are disturbing in their own ways. 
Eva and GitS have a pretty similar feeling, as you can see by their common tags (Psychological, Drama, Mecha, Sci-Fi, etc...). The biggest difference I see is that GitS doesn't go through all the supernatural part of Evangelion.They have almost the same age also and are being revived these times with new stuff, such as movies/episodes. Even though Eva is much more popular, GitS don't lose in any points to the so claimed series. If you loved to see all that questioning you had on Eva, GitS is one shot you can't lose. 
Similar dark vibe in psychological..  you watch this  
Both pose some serious questions about the human psyche and are set in the future, although in different ways. Neon Genesis is a bit more carefree while Ghost is the Shell is kinda dark. Ghost in the Shell also involves human/robot cops over mecha and focuses on the problems between humans and machines. 
Both are cult classic 90's anime, set in a futuristic world. Both are very dark and psychological, featuring a lot of symbolism and philosophy. Both create a similar atmosphere and give off a similar vibe. 
mecha mystery... they're both wonderful animes if you haven't watch these what are you doing WATCH IT NOW!!! "
30,31240,5,"While the plots are very different, and the genres of the Anime as well, I found very similar the two MCs (Shinj and Subaru).Both go under stress, anxiety and dangerous moment in which they will risk their lives. Both MCs experience mental breakdowns throughout the show because of ""someone forcing"" them to do something. There are many deaths. 
Both are desconstructions of its respective main gender(Isekai/Mecha), explores well protagonist psychological state with their suffering, have waifus, exceptional animation, 25~26 episodes and a lot of brutal deaths(the end of eva) that just influence protagonist's mental state even more. However, Evangelion is more focused on dementia while Re:Zero is on Thriller. 
What thing have in common Evangelion, Madoka Magica and Re:Zero? The three are a critic of their respective genres. The typical mecha anime show us a main character that is usually a hot-blooded teenager who gets in a robot and saves the world with it along with the power of love and friendship. In Evangelion we see that the idea of putting kids into giant robots is downright insane, a normal teenager can't be expected to mentally endure it.The typical magical girl (mahou shoujo) anime has as main character a young naive girl of pure heart who gets magical powers and saves the world with them. In Madoka Magica the idea of having young teenage girls fight to death to protect the world is just as crazy as it was with boys in robots, and even if you are a heroine with magical powers you are still human, so you still may suffer from selfish desires, and your emotions make you vulnerable, even with the power of love and friendship.The isekai (other/different world) anime, where our main protagonist usually is a japanese student/gamer/otaku/NEET/hihikomori that is transported to another world with the purpose to save it, acquiring powers and becoming the hero, (Sword Art Online for example), Re:Zero criticizes this. The show focuses on how a socially withdrawn nerd would really function in a fantasy world, expecting to be a hero, but carrying over all his personal flaws from our world, showing the spectator that he is a simple human trapped in a world he doesn't understand.This is my personal top 3 of anime that review his own genre and criticizes the cliches, if you are tired of watching plotless anime full of fanservice/ecchi, I recommend you to see the 3 above. read more 
Both MC's filter a bunch of people. Notice both shows have a 5/10 review at the top, both admitting their bias against the MC's, and both reviews have overwhelming votes. Pull up a picture of an IQ bell curve and you'll have an epiphany as to why.Anyway, both shows explore deeper into their respective genres. They both latch onto psychological themes and don't let go.Most of the cast is similar as well. Rem is literally Rei, struggling with reciprocation of feelings and Asuka/Emilia plays like a reflection of the MC. The downside is that the villains only play symbolic motives in the story.Both are great mystery thrillers that don't hand answer everything at the end.

30,13125,5,"Both series are set in the future and are very heavy. Both require you to really think about what is going, watch carefully, and will have you thinking about them long after you've finished them. If you are looking for something serious and mind boggling to watch I would definitely recommend you either of these! 
Both keep the audience ""in the dark"" for most part of the show. Giving away only bits and pieces of information for the audience to piece together and confirm as the show continues.Both have pretty dark plots. And ask some deep questions. 
They are both character driven shows that take place in a realistic future and follow child characters that learn about the harsh and dark reality of the world they live in wile the adults in charge of the situation keep trying to hid from them. 
Both are an unsettling look into the human psyche in a dystopian future.  
Similarly, this anime is dark depressing and melancholic with heavy themes of humanity, it's flaws and the perverted sense we have of what is right and wrong. Sometimes the perspective we have as humans is biased and limiting. In Shinsekai Yori the feeling of the human perspective on the world feels suffocating and this theme is explored thoroughly.  "

Both series have a young protagonist, weak, indecisive at the beginning and more determined at the end of the series.Both MC are accompanied by strong female characters. (Rin, Saber in FSN and Ayanami and Asuka Langley in NGE)The two worlds are dark, mature and post-apoalyptiques (after the 4th Holy Grail War for FSN / after the 2nd impact NGE) 
I think both animes really bring more to Japanese animation.NGE is until today known for its very good animation at the time (1995)Similarly, currently Unlimited Blade Works has an impressive animation: clever use of CGI in the fighting and the settings. If you look at the animation as an art, I think you'll be very pleased to Unlimited Blade Works. (Serie who received the award for the best animated series in the Newtype Awards 2015 [url]http://myanimelist.net/news/42586194[/url])Some aspects of FSN remind me of NGE as the presence of a main character neophyte (Shirou / Shinji) in the field (magic / EVA) and the presence of many strong female characters (Saber, Rin / Rei, Asuka) read more 
The direction that UBW takes in its second season (transitioning from a rather standard action/adventure series to something with a darker, more psychological twist) is reminiscent of NGE.

Additionally, both series feature main characters who grow into their role as a hero with the help of those around them. "

Both shows are science-fiction supported by a strong emotional core, superb characters (some even sharing similar traits), skillful direction and visual presentation; a similar setting (by that I mean a blistering silver-white city in the summer), striking uses of color (and the lack thereof), as well as a strong emphasis on making the right choices at the right times.

Both of these have psychologically deep stories, reflect dark and uncomfortable realities, and opt for non-traditional ways of presenting their narratives. 
While the plotlines are completely different, the darkness and psychology of both of these anime are on the same league. The use of music in PB also reminded me strongly of NGE.PB, much like Evangelion, has a dystopian, surreal, a bit schizophrenic feel however the most prominent difference is that PB has no lighter aspects as in the the earlier half of NGE.  "

Despite both being mechas, the actual mechas and fights in both series are very different. Instead, NGE's influence, without getting into any spoiler, can be seen with the Ragnarok concept (which in my opinion seemed like something right out of NGE).

Both also feature a war that  humanity is involved into, bittersweet moments and hints of romance; although TTLG is more over the top and comedy centered, in other hand NGNL Zero is a war drama. 
Both are about humanity achieving a goal that is not thought possible since they are far weaker than their enemy. Also, Schwi and Nia are very similar characters. 
Two completely opposite takes on pretty much the same idea of humaity being on the brink of destructionbecause of war with other races. Willstr NGNL0 is more drama focused Gurren Lagann is more comedy, over the top. "

1698,23273,42,"Both animes display some similarities:- Male protagonist is a quiet calm composed person who excels at piano. In NC we have an adult while in Shigatsu we have a teenager. They have similar personalities and yet even though NC is targeted to an older audience it is Shigatsu which displays the protagonist with a much more dramatic past and more dramatic plot. - Female protagonist is rather unique and loves to play joyfully her piano/violin. Personally I find NC's heroine a refreshing heroine because she is very centered in comedy and it is very crazy while Shigatsu's heroine delivers more tragic moments.- Heroine ends up inspiring the hero with her bright personality and that in both animes is crucial to the plot.- Hero and heroine end up making a wonderful duet in music and that is essential to the character's development.You'll find slice of life, drama, comedy and romance, so if you liked one you'll probably enjoy the other! read more 
Both focus on music, and prodigal music performers. They also share some genres in common, like some romance, some comedy, some drama, some concurs (music contests) and great classical music. 
I am gonna make this short and simple.  To me Nodame gets the edge because I enjoy comedy more.  But main difference is Nodame has a more lighthearted fun feeling while Shigatsu pulls at the heart.   
Both are touching stories about a love of music, and how life advances.  Both focused heavily on the piano and entering the music world, where you might have been left wanting more, Nodame goes that much further.  Overcoming obstacles, living life, and finding love - truly both are great animes.  Nodame, however - will leave you with less tears. 
- Both are about classical music.- Both involve MCs with polar-opposite personalities.- The male characters are precise musicians while the female characters have a aggressive yet uniquely beautiful playing style.- The girl changes the guy's life.- Both have some nice and entertaining drama.- Both are slow yet great slice of life romance anime.If you loved Nodame Cantabile and felt sad when it ended, then Shigatsu is here to soothe your pain. Absolutely recommended! 
The protagonist has a fellow musician classmate that admires one another.  One is a gifted pianist the other violinist.  They both explore what it means to create great music together and their bond only strengthens as a result.  Both anime have their moments of light humor despite being touching anime. 
Despite the age differences, Nodame Cantabile and Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso shares many similarities. The main male protagonist from both series have a talent in music playing (the piano). Their talents are noticed especially by others including the main female protagonist. Throughout the course of both series, we see character interactions between the two main protagonists who expresses their interests and emotions. There's a decent degree of realism present by the way their characters are fleshed out including their past.Both series has a great deal with focus on music as a prominent theme. Inspiring to fulfill a dream, the plot centers on their goal and what to make of it by their efforts while dealing with their internal struggles.  read more

> Both have classical music> MCs have a romantic feel for one another.> Protagonists are struggling to succeed with music after the trauma. 
What color? dark and gloomy or green; green hope not envy, the green of nature, spring, youth and the blue of sky and seas. Go and look for your violin; piano.  
The music and art when the music is playing. Both shows have art that show the setting that the musicians/conductor create through their performance. I would say Shigatsu~ is a bit more psychological/drama and a bit less rom-com, although it certainly has rom-com in it. If you were to combine Clannad and Nodame Cantabile, I think you'd have a pretty close approximation to Shigatsu~. 
Both shows about classical music. 
Both anime are music anime with a touch of drama, romance and comedy. Nodame Cantabile has more comedy than Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, while Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso has more drama than Nodame.Both are also based off of their respective manga. They both also have a male lead who plays the piano as their major instrument. Altough both protagonist's situations are quite different.Nodame Cantabile shows the male protagonist dealing with a very quirky woman, who plays the piano beautifully, living next to his apartment.Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso shows the male protagonist dealing with his trauma, and fear of playing piano, due to a breakdown he had during a concert. He meets a woman who plays the violin beautifully, and she helps him get over his traumatic experience. read more 
If you loved Musical Instruments, this might be the perfect anime that you have to watch. It is a comedy, drama and romance that will easily catch your heart. 
Great dramatic romantic love stories which has a great share of romance and music. Both music genres are classical music and loveable characters in general. 
Nodame Cantabile is thae DATABASE for Romance,Music,Comedy and Most of all FEELSSSS!!!!! it is an amazing anime and a must watch before or after this new anime.  
Shigatsu and Nodame are very much alike, here are my reasoning.Both anime have a male protagonist who excels at playing the piano. In the case of Nodame the protagonist can also play the violin at a high level.Nodame is more centered around comedy than shigatsu. Which gives it in my opinion a more light hearted feel. Shigatsu focuses more on the psychological and dark side of being a prodigy where the romantic relationship is introduced and becomes important later on. Nodame on the other hand introduces the romantic side much earlier on and focuses more on the romantic comedy style.Both anime are very much based around the theme of classical music with a focus on piano and piano & violin duo. In both anime the female part takes a big place in the development of both the protagonist and the story. Romance is a theme which both anime are centered around. They both handle this romance theme very well and it is very well intertwined in the story. There is a nice balance of romance / music in both anime.In my opinion, Nodame can be watched casually without focusing too much, while Shigatsu requires more attention from the viewer to completely understand the feeling of the characters and follow the story.I think these two anime will appeal to both romance and music lovers. Either one is worth watching. read more 
Both anime are about classical music and how the main characters have a romantic feel for one another.  
Everyone has to fight their own fights. Everyone struggles for one or other reason. These shows are about struggling musicians with different life circumstances. They play for different reasons and yet they all share an imense passion for music. They have a need to express themselves through music. Shigatsu wa is about letting go of your past and finding joy in your present through music and the people you love.  
Nodame Cantabile and Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso (Your Lie in April)  are music oriented. What's more remarkable is that the anime focuses more in classical music. Both MC also know how to play the piano and violin. Both revolve through music but they are both different in many aspects. If you want to go with an anime that is more humorous and light, go with Nodame. But if you want an anime that can make you cry, or somewhat dramatic, then pick Shigatsu. Nevertheless, Noda and Shigatsu are a masterpiece. Try watching both. You'll not be disappointed. 
Both are primarily about genius music performers and their struggles as musicians. Both are a mix of romance, comedy, general school life, and in general have bright atmospheres throughout the story. Both have piano/violin performances. 
Both are inspirational, touching stories revolving around a couple of classical music performers. They deal with music contests, romance and drama as the characters struggle to overcome their obstacles and find a direction in life. Shigatsu is more dramatic and intense and has dream-like characters that will inspire you, but Nodame is more light-hearted and funny, having characters that are less stereotypical and more realistic.  
*It's about music*It is very funny but it gets a bit dramatic later on 
- Both anime start out with a calm and pretty happy premise, but as the series progresses, they it develops into a deeper story.- Both anime are about music. 
They both revolve around classical music. Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso has a more intense drama than Nodame Cantabile, while Nodame Cantabile is more relaxing.  The characters in both series are well developed and the relation between them is a main topic in each of the series. If you enjoy one of them is highly probable that you will enjoy the other one. 
If you liked shigatsu wa kimi no uso you should watch Nodame cantabile. Nodame cantabile is not so dramatic but it has the same sense , classical music and great characters .  
If you love classical music and romance, you would like both of these shows. They are both about how the power of music and talent brings two almost completely different people (who probably wouldn't have clicked otherwise) together. Nodame is a little more light-hearted and comedic than Your Lie in April, but you'll probably enjoy it as well.  
Both animes deal with music, as well as romance. Although Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso i s a drama tearjerker focused as Nodame Cantabile is more comedy and light-hearted. Both of them also send a message to the viewer and really change your way of seeing things. If you liked Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, you will most likely also enjoy Nodame Cantabile 
Both anime are focused on protagonists struggling to succeed with music and both anime make excellent use of classical music scores. Both anime follow a blossoming love story between two musicians although they have two very different endings. The strength in both anime lies in their ability to make you care about their characters and fall in love with their music. Both anime have the ability to make you cry although for two very different reasons. 
Piano / Classical Music Drama 
Both anime have a strong musical center. Just like Noda, Kaori gets to know the person she loves through classical music. And for this two girls, their main desire is to play side by side with the man they admire.While Nodame Cantabile is mainly a comedy that will have you laughing all the way through, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso is a strong drama that will make you, perhaps, cry a little. Still, both anime are a must watch, specially for those who like music. 
They are similar in terms of:-Deals with classical music genre-Gives you a heart or warm feels-Characters are lovable and struggle in improving their music skills-Nice art styles 
A romantic story about the first pure teenage love and music. 
Both anime are focused on:- classical music as a medium of expressing emotions- a female lead that plays music with feeling, whose musicianship affects male lead- a male lead with a disorder that prevents his progress in music, but is able to overcome with the help of female lead 
If you are looking for another anime about music, I recommend Nodame Cantabile. While not as serious all the time, like Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, it still has that slice-of-life and a little bit of drama.It does add more comedy, which I think is great and really adds to the story, plus it's a good contrast with the more serious main character. The soundtrack and classical music selections are great and are played very well. If you liked Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, I definitely think you'll like Nodame Cantabile. 
If you like music anime and you like romance's then look no further then Nodame cantabile. If you are aiming for the very specific genre of accompanist music romance anime, then this is for you.  
Both series are classical-music themed. Both have animations that are accurate representations of how the instruments are played. While Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso has middle-school level protagonists, Nodame Cantabile has university-level protagonists. 
Both speak of music as the true protagonist of the story. The motivations and relationships between the characters have a direct connection to it. Shigatsu deals with this in a deeper and more emotional way while Nodame has a lighter tone even though it is more realistic about a musician's life and his difficulties. Two great works (I like both, but Shigatsu is awesome) for those who are interested in music, or simply for who enjoy a good story.  
Both shows heavily feature classical music (and classical music competitions) and a developing romance between two similar couples of characters with opposite personalities (Kousei & Kaori, Shinichi & Nodame). Both also feature some degree of drama and comedy, though Nodame Cantabile is ultimately more lighthearted. 
- both shows have music as their main theme- both shows follow a romance between two musicians 
Well, classic music is certainly the main thing that they have in common. The plot is very different as well as the characters, Shigatsu is more dramatic whereas Nodame is kinda a comedy.But since music is the main theme for both, I think you could appreciate them in the same way. The pieces that are played are really beautiful, the animation is superior for Shigatsu, but it is pleasant also for Nodame. Musical competions are present in both of them with all the struggle that may come along. "
1698,12531,12,"Both definitely have a similar feeling, ""Nodame Cantabile"" is about classical music, where ""Kids on the Slope"" is about jazz, but they both have the same goal that you should enjoy the music your playing and give it feeling and not just playing it like it's written on the music sheet. 
Both josei romances that center around a musical theme. Even though Nodame Cantabile is about classical music and Sakamichi no Apollon is about jazz, they both give you a very similar feel (minus Nodame Cantabile being absolutely hilarious).  
Both josei romances that center around a musical theme. Even though Nodame Cantabile is about classical music and Sakamichi no Apollon is about jazz, they both give you a very similar feel (minus Nodame Cantabile being absolutely hilarious). 
Both give you a look into a genre of music that is no longer mainstream.Kids on the Slope focuses on Jazz while Nodame Cantabile focuses on classical. 
In both anime it is music that unites people. 
Both are Joseis and are about music.There are romance and student environment in Japan.However there are some differences between each other:Sakamichi no Apollon  takes place in a secundary school on the sixties years; the kind of music played by main characters is the Jazz.Nodame Cantabile TV takes place in a music faculty on the present days; the kind of music played by main characters is the Classical Music.If you like a good music, like Jazz and Classical, you should watch these animes!!!If you like a good story, with romance, some comedy, drama of daily life; you may like too!! 
Both series has a josei genre and thus have a similar feeling and style.Music plays a major theme in both series that also involves romance as well as drama and comedyBoth series are quite realistic and some of the characters have similar personalities.  
Both are slice of life's in which a group of young people are brought together by their love for music. 
Its about music altough Sakamichi Apollon is more real in showing relationships and emotions. 
It might seem at first sight that the josei genre be the most striking similarity and although the musical themes are different:In ""Nodame Cantabile"" music is speaking in tones of among others Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Franz Peter Schubert, Claude Debussy und Sergei Wassiljewitsch Rachmaninow (transcription: Rachmaninoff). So an musical framework of classical gems is presented.In contrast does ""Sakamichi no Apollon"" presents the musical spirit of Jazz in the 60ties with the sound of George Gershwin, Miles Davis, Charlie Parker and Duke Ellington.Nevertheless or better that is precisely why the main visible, extremely fastidious driving force in both anime, is an highly elaborated combination of story and qualities of dedication and innovation which symbolizes the love for music that always do inspire musicians. (personal note: in the case of ""Sakamichi no Apollo"" do skip the episode 12, because with the spirit of Jazz the end doesn't harmonize at all).Both anime do have flaws but if you are fond of music, these two anime are excellent and none mainstream. They get across quite realistic, in regard to feelings and style and moreover showing well portrayed relationships and emotions. read more 
Both series involve 2 characters who are completely polar opposites in character, come together through their mutual admiration of music. Both series' also focus more on the characters and their interactions, rather than the actual story 
Both move one's heart! If you liked sakamichi Apollon for its feel then there is a 9/10 chance you will also like Nodame Cantabile! "
1698,57,6,"Both shows are centered around music. Drama isn't exactly similar in the two of them, but you'll probably end up enjoying the relationships developed between the characters. Koyuki could maybe be representative of Chiaki, as they're both struggling for a career in music. 
Nodame Cantabile is more of comedy based - so if you feel that the music presentations in it weren't enough, then watch this anime called Beck - a band that will rock your world with awesome music displays. 
their both revolve around music.. 
Both are GREAT anime about VERY NICE music, that's it :)Enjoy, musicians and music fans =D 
Both anime reveal the journey and struggles of pursuing music. 
Music is a strong influence in both Nodame Cantabile and Beck. In these two series, it plays a prominent role in shaping the main characters' lives and their futures. They share their understanding of music and their passion for it with other characters while at the same time learning about it themselves.Both series has a similar feeling that reflects the mood of the series as being more slice of life revolving around the main characters.But more than that, their appreciation of music leads the characters to meet new people and learn more about the world and even more about themselves.Both series also has comedy, drama, and romance. read more "
1698,877,6,"Nana and Nodame Cantabile are similar in that they each weigh heavily on music. Nodame Cantabile has much more comedy, whereas Nana contains more drama, but I'd group them close together in terms of character development and drama enthrallment. 
They are both romantic dramas with some comedy that have to deal with music and deep relationships with others. Both are amazing in my opinion. I highly reccomend both...NANA for the more serious and dramatic and Nodame Cantabile for a little more comedy. 
Both series has josei like artwork and contains music as a major theme.Both series features drama as well as romance presented in a more realistic way. Both series has a similar style that details every day life whether at school or with the band/choir group.  
If you're looking for romance with adult students it may be perfect for u. 
Similar setup as both Josei are slice of life that shows young adults instead of high schoolers, both deals with music, especially for Nodame Cantabile.Nana Komatsu is somewhat similar to Nodame as they are great leads that are optimistic and exceed to share their (usually joyful moods) to the spectator. Both are pretty good comedy at the beginning Nana however has a drastic shift in the middle that turn it into a drama. 
Both are romances with realistic slife of life depiction of the life of young professional musicians building a career. The degree of realism is higher in Nana, and the 2nd half has a tonal shift towards more tragedy drama, while Nodame remains relaxed and easy despite dramatic moments. Both have an ensemble cast of different musician characters with own individuality. Nana is a little rogher, not the least because it features rock musicians, while Nodame takes place on the campus of a classical music college. "
1698,22789,2,"Both are slice of life comedies which include a serious artist who take themselves too seriously having their life turned upside down by eccentric characters.

2nd Season of Diamond no Ace and Haikyuu!!Both are similiar. The main character is interesting.Both are very funny and entertaining.Both have good character development.Both are realistic, well this is shounen so there will be some unique abilities.But the abilities is not supernatural-like, so you still can tolerate it.If you like Diamond no Ace, you will like Haikyuu!! as well  
Both the second seasons of Diamond no Ace and Haikyuu!! Are pretty similar both focus on teamwork, friendship and have heart racing moments  "
30230,20583,2,"Haikyuu!! and Diamond no Ace are both amazing sports animes. They both have really intense games that could (possibly) go on for 10 episodes straight, and maybe even more! They both deal with main characters that were at a less prestigious school that deserve to go to a better school. And in highschool their wishes start being fulfilled. Both teams in these anime aim for nationals. Also, both of the main characters aim to be the ace of these teams. Plus, both anime have and/or are getting a second season. So as you can see, there are many similarities in these anime. 
both are very good and very equal so the sport practically changes and the characters love them both so I am recommending "

30346,39533,13,"High school boys finding love.  Music, and the band being it's commonality and they both fell in love because of a song. 
Both are about the natural chemistry between two high school boys. Although Given has a slightly heavier storyline, both are about growing up together with music as a catalyst. With both featuring amazing character development, they are definitely worth watching.   
A sweet highschool shounen-ai story that starts with music (Given is more centered around it) that casts a dark-haired character and a fair-haired character; the guys are different but are still attracted to each other. The focus seems to be very different, but at the core both are solid shounen ai stories. 
Both feature healthy gay relationships without the usual problematic tropes found in a lot of BL stories. Relationship progression feels organic and and very believable. Overall, this is another great love story. If you liked Given, you will likely appreciate this one as well.  
They are both really soft bl anime and I really enjoyed the both of them :) 
Sweet Shounen Ai anime without Sexual Harassment for those who despise it in the genre.Both are also about High School students and both have the involvement of being in a band. 
Both are boys love brought together by music. Manga adaptions, amazingly animated. Doukyuusei is more stylized by it's art style but both play very close to their mangas. Recommended to read the mangas of both afterwards because there is more content. Deep character development on both sides, coming of age, coming out and realistic gay experiences. Music in both is just phenomenal.  
Both stories are fairly realistic approaches to high school boys being a bands and falling in love. Both stories feature a more outgoing lead male and more secluded and shy counterpart.  What both stories get right is the natural progression of the relationship and some of the fun antics of being a high school student. The inclusion of music is done greatly in both stories too. The music feels organic and fits the mood of the stories told.  The art work is bit more stylized and has cool pastels in Doukyuusei, while in Given's art works vibrant and energetic; both styles work. 
- both follow a healthy relationship between young people- both shows use music as a catalyst that connects the characters  
Both of these Shounen-ai anime (one a movie, the other an amazing manga currently being adapted for the screen), Doukyuusei and Given, do a fantastic job of portraying the ins and outs of a gay relationship in a way that feel real. While Given has some more mature and darker themes that aren't present in Doukyuusei, they are both wonderful anime that left an impact on me. Doukyuusei has a unique, quirky animation style that wonderfully complements its themes, and I would recommend both to anyone looking for a romantic story that can play the heartstrings like a fiddle. 
these are both shonen ai and the animations and beautiful and the plot is very nicely written and both of them made me cry and is just two things that i can rewatch many time.   
both are shounen ai anime based around music. if you liked one, you're bound to like the other. 
Duokyuusei (Classmates) is a slice of life BL movie that shares many similar elements with Given. In both animes, one of the protagonists is in a band and their relationship developes over music. This anime is not quite as heavy or tearful as Given but it still manages to pull on your heart strings. The movie does an amazing job at showcasing the development of love overtime in a queer relationship, and demonstrates how the two boys fall in love in the rawest form. "
30346,12531,3,"Similar to Doukyuusei, this anime features: - two male protagonists who are very different from each other; one is smart, reserved, wealthy, and a bit of a loner, while the other is eccentric, lively, poor, and a bit of a troublemaker. The two of them are classmates, and they are both misunderstood. As a result of their opposite personalities and lifestyles, they foil one another and grow closer as the story progresses.- musical themes. The two male protagonists develop their friendship through their common passion for jazz music.- plenty of feels and romance. Unlike Doukyuusei, it's not shounen ai, but you can certainly view it that way~In general, both Doukyuusei and Sakamichi no Apollon are rather light, fun, and upbeat (save for the drama, of course), and they effortlessly whisk your heart away into their beautiful world of love, youth, and music! read more 
-Heartwarming-School Theme-Strange quiet tranquillity-Low stakes, low stress -Rowdy Troublemaker/ Bespectacled Student trope-Interesting, dream-like animation 
They both have a very natural, easy going school-time, summer-vibes type atmosphere, and both shows put a lot of emphasis on character dynamics and do a good job of capturing the overall feel of being a young and in love.  "
39533,30346,13,"High school boys finding love.  Music, and the band being it's commonality and they both fell in love because of a song. 
Both are about the natural chemistry between two high school boys. Although Given has a slightly heavier storyline, both are about growing up together with music as a catalyst. With both featuring amazing character development, they are definitely worth watching.   
A sweet highschool shounen-ai story that starts with music (Given is more centered around it) that casts a dark-haired character and a fair-haired character; the guys are different but are still attracted to each other. The focus seems to be very different, but at the core both are solid shounen ai stories. 
Both feature healthy gay relationships without the usual problematic tropes found in a lot of BL stories. Relationship progression feels organic and and very believable. Overall, this is another great love story. If you liked Given, you will likely appreciate this one as well.  
They are both really soft bl anime and I really enjoyed the both of them :) 
Sweet Shounen Ai anime without Sexual Harassment for those who despise it in the genre.Both are also about High School students and both have the involvement of being in a band. 
Both are boys love brought together by music. Manga adaptions, amazingly animated. Doukyuusei is more stylized by it's art style but both play very close to their mangas. Recommended to read the mangas of both afterwards because there is more content. Deep character development on both sides, coming of age, coming out and realistic gay experiences. Music in both is just phenomenal.  
Both stories are fairly realistic approaches to high school boys being a bands and falling in love. Both stories feature a more outgoing lead male and more secluded and shy counterpart.  What both stories get right is the natural progression of the relationship and some of the fun antics of being a high school student. The inclusion of music is done greatly in both stories too. The music feels organic and fits the mood of the stories told.  The art work is bit more stylized and has cool pastels in Doukyuusei, while in Given's art works vibrant and energetic; both styles work.

39533,36649,8,"Both about boys (Given is much more direct with their relationships)both have darker tones, not nearly as much as Banana Fish but still doesboth will leave you feeling emotional 
Despite the difference in genre, the wholesome romance/friendship dynamic between a stern, unapproachable character and a more quiet, innocent character is extremely similar. Both anime also feature characters with dark pasts and deal with difficult subjects. If one of these shows leaves you wanting more of the pure romance between two male characters with a backstory of tragic events, I highly recommend the other seeing as it is essentially the focus point of both series’. 
They're feel are very similar they both have very Sad scenes i feel like if you like one you'll love the other . Yes they are two different genres but I cried the same way in both of them even though one left me with a feeling of void the other with hope. Their animations are amazing a well (they both have BL content sooo go for it my fellow fujoshis and fudanshis out there ;)) 
If you want to think about something else than banana fish watch given 
If you watched Banana Fish I think it's fair to say that part of the reason was because of the interesting relationship between Ash and Eiji, I mean come on! We all love a little BL. Given is also a BL title, and though it's not as emotionally painful as Banana Fish, It still has very sad themes. The slow development of Mafuyu and Uenoyama's relationship won't fail to keep you on the edge of your seat. Plus you don't really see a whole lot of band related animes. 
Deals with heavy themes as well, but ultimately very satisfying and heartwarming in the way Banana Fish is as well. Similarly, Given paints the boys as real people, not stereotypes, which is what Banana Fish does so well.  
They both are animes not particularly sad, but emotional, you could be filled with happiness, sadness, confusion or emptiness when you finish either of the animes. They are both very well-made and can make you want to watch for a second time! 
These shows are both subtle shounen-ai. Banana Fish is more Action-Drama while Given is Music-Drama. They’re also both very heartwrenching at times. "
39533,12531,6,"Both are about two high school boys who love music. While Sakamichi is not categorized as Shounen Ai, the two main boys relationship can easily be interpreted as a romantic one with how close they become and how clearly they care for one another.  
Music is the the driving theme of these anime and also romance. Both quite different in terms of story, but equally as enjoyable.  
Given is less depressing and more happy than Apollon. It is also gayer and replaces the jazz music with rock. If you want something more lighthearted with character focus and a music oriented theme, Given is for you. 
If you're looking for something that focuses mainly on music, Given and Apollon are the right choices. They also deal with love and friendship, although the main topic is music. 
Kids on the Slope and Given connect based on music mostly, but there’s also the theme of friendship and romance present in both. In both of them, two people get closer based on their love for music, and the main protagonists are both new to what they’re doing. 
Similarities:-Both have to do with music-Both are really sad-The MC give off the same vibe "
39533,23273,4,"Its very similar in terms of how both animes take their characters on a smiliar journey of dealing with life through music and romance. And both have beautiful music and extremely emotional messages along with everything else. As a BL it has a far more realistic portrayal of relationships as well. 
Music is the focus of both anime and they both prioritize different instruments in the musical spectrum; therefore. it gives watchers different perspectives and enjoyable yet different anime to watch in the same category. 
Both of these will make you cry! Your lie in April is so heart warming but so sad and Given will hit you in the feels with the back story (given is BL but it doesn’t get weird) 
These are 2 great music anime with a deep story behind them. while the story differs quite a bit, both are very emotional and heartfelt series. also the music performed in both shows are incredible, it will leave you thinking about the song for hours after you stop watching. "
39533,20583,2,"All of the characters in given will remind you of the characters in Haikyuu!! From the leads being a orange-haired softie trying to get better and a dark-haired prodigy aiding in that process. given also has the main group of characters working towards a singular goal, just replace volleyball with music. given, while it is BL, may fill the void that Haikyuu!! has when it comes to relationships.  
All similarities that i have gathered;1- Physical similarities of main duo2- They are passionate about the work they do and put a lot of effort in it3- They help each other grow emotionally and form a bond4- All characters are friendly and soft5- Even though they are different areas(music&sports) they teach the details and technical wordings of these areas efficiently6- It pushes you to chase your dreams7- Friendships in them are truly inspiring "
39533,33352,2,"Both talk about loss and a journey to try to be full again and recovering 
I think all fans of Violet Evergarden will enjoy Given. The themes of love, longing, and moving on are apparent in both shows. They manage to communicate the themes of love coming in many different forms through unique means. Two main characters in both of these shows are strikingly similar, and the openings and endings are also deeply moving and tell a story in their own right. If you want another short, yet everlasting story, please consider giving Given a chance. "
39533,57,2,"They have similar storylines in how a newbie guitar player becomes friends with an older band,whom discover his hidden talent is singing. While given is more romance driven, there are still themes of discovering life through and around music, new friendships and the dedication needed to be in a band.  
Both series deal with band music. Both vocalists have mesmerizing voices and both guitarists have godly skills. You could see the struggles of being in a band in both series. "
39533,877,2,"Both anime have a powerful focus on romance, character development ,drama and music. Also both are fantastic watches and are a nice change of pace from the current popular shows.If you enjoyed one I hope you can give the other a shot.  
I would recommend Nana to anyone who enjoyed Given because they are both music anime and they both include 2 characters with a complex wholesome relationship. The same feelings of the joy of friendship, the complications of life and overall relaxing tone is reflected in both series. In Nana the 2 main characters have a platonic relationship unlike given, however the bond the 2 characters in nana share made me fell the same as a romantic one. Also Nana has superrrr cool outfits and great music too! lots of punk and vivienne  "
57,877,25,"Music, music, music. Both series have great music scores to keep you entertained, not to mention the underlining drama that eats away at each character. Even if you're not a fan of the drama, you'll probably end up enjoying the music in some sense~ 
Both are good music series. Competition of two bands, romance, drama, and of course good music. Must see both 
Nana feels like the love-child of Beck and Honey & Clover.  If you liked Nana, I'd suggest Beck if you liked the struggling band/musical aspects of Nana.  And vice versa. =) 
Nana and Beck tell us about the musical industry and everything concerning the creative process. We'll meet naive novices and tycoons of record labels, rookies and stars. Although in Nana the story is focused on love and relationships, it's also about the life of musicians, including live shows in small clubs, the recording process, promotion and music videos. If you want to know more about the musical industry you'll enjoy watching these series. 
Both series are done by Mad House. Both have their good share of drama and music, and overall the atmosphere is similar. They both have similar characters and the struggle of a new band trying to show this world their talent. 
Music and life.Both are great anime about a group of friends trying to make a rock band.Slice of life, drama, and romance are the predominant elements of both series (Nana is more girl-oriented, though).There is also the competition between 2 rival bands.We see the characters growing up during the series, and struggling to make their dreams come true.Also, both anime are by Mad House, and Takumi and Ryusuke are similar. 
Both anime have a theme of music, BECK is more of a music fans anime while NANA is more centered toward a shoujo audience . never the less both anime are amoung my favourite. Although I feel BECK is my favourite anime of all time NANA is the closest anime you will get related to rock music. (next to BECK that is) 
Both NANA & Beck are focused on music. NANA has female main characters and the serie centers around them. Also, they're already in their twenties. Beck on the other hand has young boys as main characters. Their both great to watch and have their own amount of music and drama. 
both are portraying a struggling rock band for their path to popularity, their love problems, friendship... although, nana is a more emotional, and from a girls point of view, while in beck, except their music (and all around it), we do not get to know their other side: family. both have some great music, that will stuck to your mind hours and days later. enjoy! 
There both are about trying to make it big in a band and falling in love. 
Revolving around music and in a way relationships. Beck is more of an anime I'd recommend if you enjoy having your adrenline pumping. Captivating, slow at times but worth every minute of every episode. Catchy music.Nana, more if you want to have your heart thumping, rising, tears in your eyes. Yet still some essences of adreanline. Creative characters, good story lines. Overall both series are MUST-WATCH for all music fans be they pop music, indie, rock, heavy metal, punk.  
Both focus on the mentality and hard work it takes to become the biggest rock band in the world. Both feature AMAZING soundtracks plus references to big rock bands. 
Great and about music both 
Both are well-received anime centered around drama and music. Both have fantastic soundtracks.  
Wow, both of these series reminds me of one and the other in a variety of ways.Both series features music as a prominent theme. They have a band who are trying to make a name of themselves in the music industry. But more than that, there is a complex friendship between the two main characters in both series.Beck and Nana are like brothers and sisters imo. They have comedy, romance, drama, and is presented in a mature way that is more than the typical shoujo/high school romances. Both series also has that slice of life feeling detailing some of the events of the characters' every day lives whether involving their careers or their love lives.  read more 
If you like Beck you might just enjoy Nana. They both have rock bands and awesome music and are pretty realistic. The only difference is Beck is light, comedic and shounen. Nana makes you cry its Shoujo. 
Nana and Beck have very similar feeling. When I was watching Beck, I remembered all my feelings about Nana. Also both have really great music and they are uncomparable to other animes from music genre.  
Slice of life very similar taking place in a group of emerging music , combining musical passion and love passion in camera ... own dramatic tone for this special period that the transition from adolescence to adulthood where every failure is a deep wound , and every passion a religion. I have seen Nana there a long time now but I have always this feeling of desperate intensity among dream , hope, resignation, duty ... Two animated reflects very well our first steps in the world torn by our hopes and discovery of our limitsSlice of life très similaires qui prennent place dans un groupe de musique naissant , mêlant passion musicale et passion amoureuse en huis clos... un ton dramatique propre à cette période si particulière qu'est la transition de l'adolescence à l'age adulte où chaque échec est une profonde blessure et chaque passion une religion . J' ai vu Nana il y a fort longtemps maintenant mais j' ai toujours cette sensation d'intensité déséspérée entre rêve, espoir, résignation, devoir...Deux animés reflétant très bien nos premières armes dans le monde tiraillés par nos espérances et la découverte de nos limites. read more 
Both of these two anime revolve around the topic music in one way or another, for example they both involve bands trying to make their debut. The overall feeling is the same, in both they are dealing with everyday issues and things that ""ordinary"" people can relate to. 
The two dominant music-dramas in anime/manga, for good reason. Both feature excellent rock based soundtracks and deal in the realistic when it comes to human drama. Beck is more of a ""breaking out of your shell and do something"" story, while Nana is more about the pitfalls that come with freedom as young adults. Nana's a stronger work, but Beck's really easy to watch, so I'd start with it if you haven't seen either. 
they both are centered around music and drama and romance.however, nana has more drama and romance than beck while beck has more music.but both are still really enjoyable and if you like one you would probably like the other 
- Both Beck and Nana deal with the hardships that certain people face as they attempt to make themselves and their music known, as well as deal with other day-to-day conflicts. - Both Nana and Beck deal with the lives of musicians and how people can be changed by music. - In each of the series there is a band that is trying to get started up, and become a group that everyone knows. - Nana and Beck both tells us about the musical industry and everything concerning the creative process.- In both series they show the sacrifices that need to be made while in a band as well as relationships and hardships that must be dealt with in everyday life.While differences between from the shows' intended audience--Nana, a josei; and Beck, a shounen--are clear, both believably chart the growth in its main character's maturity with wonderful relationships to supporting characters, love interests, and the abstraction of the music business as an antagonist. These anime are top notch in the music genre. If you enjoyed one of the series because of its writing as well as music concepts you will no doubt more than enjoy the other.  read more 
Nana and Beck are two music anime, that are about the life of a musician and the creative process, that goes into what they´re doing. They´re both heavily focused around rock music and have a score to complement such. 
Nana is an wonderful example for a well done combination of slice of life, with very good development of its characters and their relationships, and an insight in the later punk music scene. If you like good melodrama, with a charming kind of sophisticated, fitting humor presenting compelling characters in an extremely impressive music arrangement & astonishing seiyû, you should try ""Nana"" too.Beck and Nana are not identical but they do hit the same tone in the best sense of the word. 
Music, feelings and Love.While Beck  is more focused on Music industry , Nana Deals with love and a lot drama and at the same time with concerts, music and lifes of musicians. "
57,12531,17,"Beck is a modern high school coming-of-age story where a nobody becomes a somebody by becoming a member of a rock band. Kids on the Slopes is a josei romance drama disguised as a high school coming-of-age story centered around jazz in the 1960's.On the surface the two series appear similar. They both use music as a way of introducing and connecting their characters with the rest of the cast; including love interests that act as motivational factors. However, where as jazz is just a means to romantic ends in Kids on the Slopes, in Beck music is the most important aspect: it's the driving force of a story where character growth is linked into the titular band's successes and failures. There's a romance subplot in Beck that causes frustration and rage, for sure, but there's no denying that Beck is, first and foremost, about music.Kids on the Slopes' greatest problem is this: its manga was serialised in a magazine called 'Flowers'. Hardly the ideal platform for a coming-of-age story with a a male lead, and that shows through; both in terms of the romantic focus AND male lead characterisation that's overly feminine. Jazz barely gets a look-in aside from when the cast hang out together. In contrast, Beck is more male-orientated with its lead's characterisation, and although romance gets far less attention, the heroine has caused anger in more than one fan for being realistically bitchy. That sort of naturalness is missing from Kids on the Slopes with its far more shoujo / soap operaish approach to romance. In short: if you're looking for something shoujoish with music on the side, watch Kids on the Slopes. If you're a male looking for a coming-of-age story centered around music, watch Beck. Simple as that.  read more 
The similar part is that both anime are for high school students who play music.The difference is that Sakamichi no Apollon is more about the love stories of the characters and is full of cliches, while Beck is more about music and characters' development as persons through music. 
If you're musician or you just enjoy heartwarming stories featuring music and romance, then both shows are must-watch. 
Similar premise, just replace Jazz music with Rock music as the main music focus. Characters are all in high school as well in both, however Beck takes place in present day. 
Tbh, I found these two series quite alike in terms of their pace and feeling when watching them.Both Beck and Sakamichi no Apollon (also known as Kids on the Slope) explores the theme of music and how the main characters of the series embraces them.Both series' artwork is naturalistic and has realism that reflects the older ages compared to the more modern 2000's style.Both series has a slice of life theme in it that features comedy, drama, and romance.Both series are a breath of fresh air so give it a shot. 
It's not only about music. BECK - ROCK, Sakamichi - JAZZ.But also it's slice of life about musicians lifes. About problems of everyone of us, because everyone've got plenty of them. It's about how hard is love, friendship and keeping your existence in society. 
Both of these titles are set in the present and feature high school kids as the main characters. There is a great deal of high school drama, but at the end of the day the characters best relate through music. Beck is much more lighthearted and funny; kids on the slope tries to be more thoughtful. Both are excellent animes. 
In my opinion, there are only two kinds of animes. Drama and Action.Beck and Sakamichi share a feeling through the whole series. The action is slow and you can't expect a bloody gunfight every episode. The characters will always be presented as very simple, but the more you dive into the understanding of the characters meaning in the series, you will obtain that everyone has a light and a dark side. The character you thought were a ugly scumbag, will maybe turn out to be the nicest character in anime history! Judge the book by the content, not the cover.Also, both animes has a love to music. Beck is for all the rock/pop-lovers, and Sakamichi is for 60's jazz. Both animes will create a big view of both genres, and you will understand why the music-culture is very important. If you don't like this kind of music, you should consider watching either Beck or Sakamichi.Last but not least, both animes aren't just about music. Actual themes is also friendship, love, hard work and accomplishing goals and following dreams! read more 
same music but smaller and better than beck less complicated some times and some time more complicated then beck unfortunate it doesn't have a ending like beck which can keep the viewer hoping that there would be more. so to sum it up smaller and better similar in a lot of ways love music and a whole lot of fun included that kids on slope for you :) 
Music, Music, Music. While Beck deals with rock music, Sakimichi no Apollon deals with jazz. If you're a fan of jazz, this is a must-watch. Add that to the brilliant writing and character development, and you get one of the best shows a music fan could watch. 
Both series focus on teenage kids learning how to play music and having fun doing so.Despite one being focused on rock, and the other on Jazz, with one taking place in modern-day Japan, and one taking place in 1960s Japan, they still both have a very similar tone to their presentation, as well as similarities between the characters and their experiences in learning music. 
Both are about a band and their struggles revolving around music 
both revolve around music and have a beautiful story of friendship. They are also both shows that will be remembered for their great music played. They are both a must watch, so if you have seen one go and watch the other NOW!! 
Both presents coming of age story. There is romance. Male lead is a boring boy who turn to be musician after binding friendship with problematic boy 
Music, feelings, and drama with Slice of life style  
If you like Sakamichi no Apollon/Kids on the Slope, then I think Beck/Mongolian Chop Squad might be right up your alley. Both series are about young people performing music and growing as a result of their exploration of the art. They both work as coming of age stories, with characters in both plots becoming different people by the end of their respective narratives. Beck is a bit more gritty than Kids on the Slope as it takes place in the mid 2000s and focuses on young rockers trying to make a name for themselves. It isn't quite as visually charming but I still found it to be well done for the time in which it released. It's also longer at 26 episodes, but it starts to go a lot faster the deeper in you go.I wholeheartedly believe you'll enjoy Beck if you enjoyed Kids on the Slope as both series explore the performance and love of music as a way of developing lasting social bonds. They may have a different feel to them but the themes of friendship, growing up and changing oneself are strong in both anime. Both shows teach us that music can help us change and grow as people. read more 
Ok imma say it straight up, Sakamichi no Apollon is just Beck but jazzSame mood and feel plus both of the character rosters of the mentioned show are really well-written and characterized. Definitely recommend Sakamichi no Apollon if you like Beck and music anime in general. "
57,1698,6,"Both shows are centered around music. Drama isn't exactly similar in the two of them, but you'll probably end up enjoying the relationships developed between the characters. Koyuki could maybe be representative of Chiaki, as they're both struggling for a career in music. 
Nodame Cantabile is more of comedy based - so if you feel that the music presentations in it weren't enough, then watch this anime called Beck - a band that will rock your world with awesome music displays. 
their both revolve around music.. 
Both are GREAT anime about VERY NICE music, that's it :)Enjoy, musicians and music fans =D 
Both anime reveal the journey and struggles of pursuing music. 
Music is a strong influence in both Nodame Cantabile and Beck. In these two series, it plays a prominent role in shaping the main characters' lives and their futures. They share their understanding of music and their passion for it with other characters while at the same time learning about it themselves.Both series has a similar feeling that reflects the mood of the series as being more slice of life revolving around the main characters.But more than that, their appreciation of music leads the characters to meet new people and learn more about the world and even more about themselves.Both series also has comedy, drama, and romance. read more "
57,1210,5,"Both are essentially indie movies that were animated. Both Koyuki and Sato are stuck in a very bad mind set in the very start of the shows, and I believe that Koyuki could have ended up like Sato if not for his music passion.  
If you like the Independent movie-like feel of NHK, then check out Beck: Mongolian Chop Squad a show about a band that takes the world by storm. 
Both involve a lead male character who does not know what to do in life. These two stories have a combination of comedy and drama which makes these two show enjoyable right to the very 
I dont know why, but i guess the mood feels the same :+)

329,1210,8,"Although the plots are very different, a theme in Planetes seems to be fear of isolation. It's the only other show I can think of besides N.H.K. that seems to have captured a very 'real' quality in its characters' fear, motivations, weaknesses and behaviors. Very complex in terms of not seeming overwrought or artificial and keeping a healthy dose of humor (like N.h.K.) in the show. 
I can't tell you that these shows are similar, because they aren't. But after watching Planetes, then NHK, I can say that I got the same feeling I got while watching Planetes. In the end they were both highly enjoyable, and overall both were top notch.  
Both Planetes and NHK delve deep into peoples emotions and struggles, but what they truly share in common, besides their atmosphere or ""vibe"", is the feeling of loneliness. While NHK is more focused on the social isolation and mental health problems of its characters, Planetes uses the loneliness of the characters as a way to showcase their struggles and goals in life, without ever actually exploring the subject of mental health. There's indeed an arc in the story where they do this, but only as a way to make the character further develop during the show, instead of being the whole focus of it. 
tl;dr Planetes is the only other anime that gives me the Welcome to the NHK ""feels"".Welcome to the NHK is very unique, so unique that there's really nothing like it in terms of story. Planetes has a very different story, setting, atmosphere, and  characters, but both are deep anime that evoke feelings of isolation, loneliness, helplessness, and loss, while also making you laugh, giving you hope, and telling an awesome story.  
Both stories reveal the theme of human feelings, especially loneliness. In addition, Ai Tanabe sometimes looks and behaves like a Misaki Nakahara. 
Both delve into the topic of loneliness, isolation, and the mental horrors that naturally follow such states of living. 
A sense of quirkiness, attention to characters, some romantic development and investigation to psychological issues. Both Planetes and NHK deal with psychological issues present within there independent settings, whilst also containing a similar quirky sense of humour. Planetes differs as a Sci-fi with a much larger cast of characters, whilst also divulging into political and societal issues. While NHK divulges much deeper into a variety of psychological issues present within the constraints of ones home, whilst also presenting a particularly dark sense of humour. If you like one for its focus on characters, investigation into relevant issues and quirky atmosphere, you'll be sure to like the other. read more 
Welcome to the NHK is a dramatic and psychological love story that centers around a group of NEETS with various social disorders and traumas. Throughout the story, the characters learn to accept themselves and the ones around them and try to fit in society. The story has its share of comedy, depressing, inspiring and heart-warming moments. Planetes gives you the same feel, as its story manages to mix romance, drama, comedy and a bit of psychology just like Welcome to the NHK. Planetes plot main focus is on the expansion of humankind into space and all the issues surrounding it, however just like NHK, throughout the adventure, you get to know the main and side characters to an intimate and psychological level and all their backgrounds and motivations to go into space, where in NHK you get the dark backgrounds and reasons why the characters can't function correctly in society.Space is a vast place and it can be very lonely if you don't have someone alongside you. In essence, both anime deal with isolation and social integration and are incredibly inspiring in their own way. The setting might be different, but it doesn't matter where a human being goes, he'll still need social interaction or he'll eventually break.Beautiful looking and a great OST to boot, these anime are a roller-coaster of emotions that might make you cry, laugh, have a good time, feel depressed, or even inspired. read more "
329,1,4,"They have -go with the flow- underdog characters. Episodic sctructure uses the routine of dealing with people's problems around as the main story progresses. Both puts importance in scientific and engineering accuracy and realistic future depiction. Their animation fluidity goes up a notch in action heavy scenes. 
I'd say they both start off with more or less the same way, however planetes shoot off with an Arc halfway throught the series while Cowboy Bebop has no particular arc until the last few episodes.But both animes explored the character really well throughout the series which then results a brilliant ending, they are both comedic, they are both set in space, and they have more or less the lowest of jobs(Taking out the Trash and a Bounty Hunter) Whenever I watched both anime I can't seem to stop myself from thinking of the other. If you liked Planetes, you'll like Cowboy Bebop. and the same if you liked Cowboy Bebop you'll like Planetes. Both are amazing animes if you haven't watched it, WATCH IT NOW! read more 
Both shows are character-driven shows set in space with a rag-tag group of unlikely companions. Both series have light-hearted and often comical overtones with serious and thought-provoking moments that often deal with very relevant issues in current society. Both series also get a little darker/more serious towards end. 
Both Planetes and Cowboy Bebop emits a similar sense of style, as they are both space anime containing some action with episodic storytelling. Planetes differs with additional quirkiness, a larger focus of its characters, further developments of its concepts and the input of romance. While Cowboy Bebop differs with a larger focus on the action, its sense of adventure and its music. If you like one for its sense of creative style you'll be sure to like the other. "
329,25835,3,"Yes, this one is a bit farfetched. But there's similar vibe in portraying something as dull as everyday work and turning it into piece of entertainment.  
An optimistic, dream-driven girl begins working a thankless job only to discover that the field is not what it seems. She then sets out to discover what makes the work so alluring to her, making new friends and having a few laughs along the way. A healthy balance of drama and comedy alongside some of the most unique careers out there.  
Despite the difference in their setting, both Shirobako and Planetes explore similar topics: starting out in a new workplace, full of new rules to learn, mistakes to make and co-workers to meet. In both anime, the focus is on everyday worklife, not large plots to save the earth from destruction. The enemies are deadlines and broken equipment, not the big bad of the week.You will follow the inexperienced lead through her experiences at the workplace, see her question her purpose in life and, finally, find fulfillment at work. "
45,918,15,"Himura Kenshin, once feared as the great assassin Hitokiri Battousai, has now become a wandering ronin who seeks to make amends with his past sins in the Meiji Period.  Despite the official sword ban implaced by the government, Himura Kenshin still carries a ""sakabatou"" (reverse blade sword), and plans to achieve his goal by saving as many lives as he can with his sword.  He instead stumbles upon the Kamiya Dojo and becomes a boarder there.  Both Gintama and Rurouni Kenshin focus on the life of a samurai and how he tries to make his way in the new era after the war. read more 
Gintoki and Kenshin have a great deal in common.  Both are former samurai who were among the most feared by their enemies during a great war.  Like Gintoki, who uses a wooden sword to avoid killing, Kenshin uses a reversed bladed sword, for the same reasons.  There are also many similiarities between supporting characters in the two shows as well. 
Gintama's character structure is completely based off of this story, and you will definitely enjoy to learn where the persona of the characters originated.Overall this is a must watch for anyone that is currently watching gintama. 
The heart of the Samurai - for those who are interested in the way of the samurai should like both series ^^ 
In Gintama and Rurouni Kenshin, the main characters Gintoki and Kenshin both are former war heroes of a great revolution, who now try to enjoy their daily lives as average civilians. Of course, the peace cannot keep up forever, as trouble surrounds these two as their pasts catch up with them.Since Gintama features almost every main character of Rurouni Kenshin either in character, appearance or historical role, yet comically exaggerates their characteristics and throws them into nonsensical adventures, it can easily be considered a direct parody of Rurouni Kenshin. 
1. both shows are about wandering samurai after a time when swords have been banned (but Gintama is more set in an alternate future where aliens have taken over and Rurouni Kenshin takes place in the Meiji period)2. both the main title characters (Gintoki and Kenshin) are extremely strong with a darkish past3. both use historical names/organizations (ex. Shinsengumi)4. Kenshin and Gintoki are both very strong but handicap themselves (reverse-blade sword for Kenshin and a wooden sword for Gintoki)5. Both Kenshin and Gintoki are against killing (Kenshin more than Gintoki)6. Kenshin and Gintoki are very silly/goofy, but when they get serious their whole personality changes7. Both shows are really good read more 
Both anime are set in the same historical period, but with some big differences: while Rurouni Kenshin tries as hard as it can to be a historical accurated portrait of late 19th century Tokyo, Gintama is set in a totally fictional Tokyo where rounins and people dressed in typical Japanese clothes share space with advanced technology and aliens.Also, Kenshin and Gintoki have a very similar past, as both played a leading role in the ultimate Japanese Civil War and became legends; now, they want to leave their past behind and try to live a peaceful life, hiding their scars from the past with a carefree pose.And for the last but not the least, both main characters dropped the katana in favor of non-lethal swords like bokken (Gintoki) and a reverse-edged sword (Kenshin).Gintama is more comedy-driven, while Rurouni Kenshin is more action-paced. read more 
Both about samurai who prefer not to kill people because of a violent past.  Both employ drama and comedy in turn.  Kenshin is more serious than Gintama, which has a lot of silly, immature, or pointless humor (which is, of course, part of its charm).   
Both are similar to each other in a lot of ways.Strong protagonists who have a somewhat dark past.Goofy at most of the times but know when to get serious.And the shinsengumi is involved as well. Also Shisio (Rurouni) is quite similar to Shinsuke(Gintama) 
Both anime series have samurais and dozens of hardcore action battles. 
Gintama and Rurouni Kenshin are alike in many ways.-They both have the same type of humor and use it in the same way.-Both of the MC's have the same type of morals.-Both take place during the time of samurai. 
With a past behind, a war veteran lives in peace until his past finds him again. A samuai in an era without samurai helps those who need your help along with the person who dreams of recovering their dojo. Two anime with different themes but accompanied by good humor and fighting, although both with more than one than the other. 
So maybe you're asking..why you're making a recommendation of these two animes?Well actually even if these animes are very different from each other with Gintama being comedy and serious battle shonen arcs(sometimes):-Both have historical setting..but If you liked Gintama you'll like the references and all the detailed story of edo period, and here it is taken in a more serious way with drama and romance-Both involve samuraiThere are only 4 episodes of Rurouni Kenshin Ova so be sure to watch those 
Both are chanbara (of course) Gintoki and Kenshin both run into a girl and her brother who run a dojo, and Gintoki much like Kenshin meets a sizeable cast of characters that have to help him stop a bunch of people determined to topple society. Gintama is primarily comedic but has quite a few fully serious arcs, and Gintama replaces the Western presence with Aliens (but both take place around the same time, that time being 1840's-60's Japan) 
Gintama basically feels like a parody of Rurouni Kenshin, besides both are great series with epic animation and badass osts with top notch voice acting "
45,205,9,"The Anime are a go to for anybody looking for a place to start with Anime involving Samurai. The main protagonist in either series aren't your average samurai and tend to do their own thing, yet crossing paths with a certain individual ends up causing a change of direction in their lives they never expected to find themselves on. 
Both samurai, sword cutting Anime with enough comedy to keep you entertained 
Both are samurai stories set in a similar historical context and period. They also portray the persecution of Japanese Christians in the past centuries (Samurai Champloo - canon material; Rurouni Kenshin - fillers). 
They're both about Samurai in the not-so-ancient past, but RK is less realistic and has some romance elements as well. 
Not only two of the best Samurai themed anime series getting around, but two of the best Anime series period.Both are very rich in historical content aswell. 
samurai traveling, sort of champloo has more traveling, but stories along the way to the final finish, characters similar (not really) but same Japanese style, relaxing entertaining stuff 
If you enjoy a Shounen which involves sword fighting, crazy awesome samurai skills and a tremendously realistic back story - I would definitely recommend Kenshin. The art styles are quite different however, you need to understand that Kenshin came out back in the 90s and Samurai Champloo is one of the new age ones.It sticks to the theme of Edo and Tokyo, the revolution around that time and how it not only affected samurais and nobility but common folks.Personally, these two animes made me research more about Japanese history than any other anime. 
The two are animes of samurai in their journeys both have historical facts about ancient japan, the two certainly entertain with their good action fights, their comic dialogues their stories and also have romance in both. 
both are samurai shows that are comedies, though they have different kinds of comedy. Both shows excel in characters and comedy coming from the differences between the characters. "
45,11061,3,"i think those two anime are alike because they both have a deep meaningful plot. overall art, story , and the imagination-world are all necessary to define a well value anime. this recommendation isn't based on just a fanboy expressions but a well belief of knowing what is great. 
As Rurouni Kenshin, the duels in Hunter x Hunter are more based in Strategy and in the psychological state of the fighters than in special powers. Also, the majority of the cast in both anime are morally ambiguous characters. Lastly, both have great arcs, Yorkshin in Hunter x Hunter and Kyoto in Rurouni, that focus in a bunch of charismatic bandits that the viewer will surprisingly support and love. 
It's very enjoyable to watch Rurouni Kenshin if you have already watched Hunter X Hunter. There is a lot of similarities between these two top tier pieces of battle shounen genre, like the construction of the impact in the major scenes, the way with which the anime induces you to empathize with the characters, and the constant explanations of special powers. "
45,5114,3,"Both are epic action shows with a lot of depth, great characters, and deep philosophy. 
Rurouni Kenshin and FMA: Brotherhood may have entirely different settings and stories, but the pace and character development in these two shows could not be more similar. Both shows strongly emphasize character development, fully developing the main cast as well as the side characters and villains so the viewer can fully understand all their perspectives. Also, the soundtracks of both shows are flawless. 
-Both have really good characters-Both have amzing mains charcaters-Both have an message, Kenshin is talking about the notion of evilness, while Fullmetal Alchemist is talking about becoming an adult "
45,2418,3,"Both involves sealed sword and passionate samurais. 
Samurai era period with a main character so similar to Kenshin. An extremly skilled warrior haunted with a dark past for what he has done, now seeks and finds peace in atonement for his deeds. 
Both shows are samurai dramas based on historical facts, with some cool action, however S:MH is a bit more realistic and brutal. Although plots are a bit different, but Kenshin is basically the same character as Nanashi. Both of them are ronins who regret their past. Even though both of them were extremely skilled assassins in past, in current era they avoid to kill people no matter what. "
45,33,2,"Charismatic main character, a lot of battles and deep lore. 
If you enjoy sword fights and a tragic hero then Kenshin and Berserk are for you. They both have a manslayer as a protagonist and are full of action-packed battles. While one shows the reformed side of a sword fighter and the other the manslayer side, they both have two deep characters that will make your heart ache for them. Each series' lead character, Gatsu and Kenshin, know only one thing in life: the sword. Each of them relies on this knowledge, for better or worse, to live their lives and to help the ones they love. "
2418,205,14,"both samurai and have awesome art and fighting scenes 
Easily two of the best swordfighting series out there. Both are set in a fictional historical setting of Japan, where the samurai way of life is strong. When it comes to fight scenes, we see amazing choreography that does't require supernatural abilities. Fight scenes are realistic, fluid, without having to resort to superpower moves, repetitive movements, long in-between conversations, and so forth. Samurai Champloo is episodic in nature and more light-hearted, but Sword of the Stranger is a film with a straightforward and serious plot.  
 Both are recommended to to anyone looking for some impressive sword fights and strong characters.If you loved the action in one of the two, you should definitely check the other out. Champloo's action focuses more on the details and fluidity while sword of the stranger's has a more emotion driven and cinematic 'feel' to it. 
Both facing a similar plot: traveling samurai.Both anime placed in similar ages, and both having pretty good strong samurai as main characters.Sword of the Stranger is a pearl (sadly a single movie) of animation and i can say that both anime are masterpieces in their own way. 
Both have beautiful art and thoughtful stories. Also both have action that is executed well and without being gratuitous or over done. 
It has the same type of fighting style, in my opinion - it's wild, anything goes! 
They're both samurai themed with verry stylized fighting sequences, and both Mugen and Nanashi have a thing for saving the helpless (then of course getting so attached to the ones they saved that they risk their lives for them em' everytime they get in trouble... -.-) 
Both series has great and crazy fights, a lot of humour and also main characters are similar.I think when you liked Sword of the stranger, you will definitely like also this one. 
Both Sword of the Stranger and Samurai Champloo were well done, and had intense sword fighting scenes.However Sword of the Stranger was more serious that Samurai Champloo. That being said, Sword of the Stranger had more realistic fighting scenes. You could actually see the swords being swung instead of white lines where they were swung. If you can, get Sword of the Stranger in 1080p because the animation was really well done, and you don't want to loose any quality. 
Awesome fight in both anime. They both take place in a feudal Japan. They both don't lack of blood. 
One of the few shows that can truly rival the animation and pure intensity of the sword fights in Samurai Champloo. 
The fight scenes in both anime are beautifully executed. Both feature a travelling samurai who considers himself to be a lone wolf until meeting another lone wolf.Set in similar periods of time. A main character from both anime happen to have an animal companion.THE SOUNDTRACK! 
Both are set in a similar era and follow Samurai traveling. The movie and the series contain many great swordfights and have sympathetic characters. 
Badass sword fights and strong characters.Both of story are set in feudal Japan.Especially, soundtracks was awesome in both anime. "
2418,44,4,"Both shows take place in feudal Japan, a time during which samurai were prominent.  Although the plot is widely different between Tsuiokuhen and Sword of the Stranger, each show gives amazing and graphic sword battles in conjunction with a beautiful soundtrack.  In addition, the feeling that both shows give you can be deemed similar.   
Both have a lot of blood, gore, tragedy and sword fights. 
Similar stories focusing on two Ronin with tragic pasts that end up becoming attached to a character and fighting for their sake, despite their initial reluctance and lack of empathy. Tsuiokuhen is much darker in style and substance than Sword of the Stranger although both retain a serious tone. Beautiful soundtracks in both titles also create much of the immersion and emotional value of the experience. It wouldn't be unlikely for somebody to cry during the endings of these titles.  
Besides the fact that both revolve around skilled swordsmen with similar emotional backgrounds, they also share gorgeous animation, deftly executed action sequences, and powerful soundtracks. Must-sees for sure. "
2418,164,4,"Both these movies are set in a similar kinda time period (the beginings of guns and gunpowder) with Princess Mononoke being more fantasicalAlso they both deal with the conflict of ideals and loyalty. 
Armies clash around two characters, who, while they don't trust each other at first, try to make sense of the world. Both deal with the same themes during approximately the same time period. Mononoke is more fantasy, Stranger is slightly more realistic/grittier.  
Both movies are set during the late Middle Ages in Japan and feature action with a good variety of pre-modern weapons (e.g matchlocks, spears and bows). Their differences lie in themes; Princess Mononoke is a semi-historical fantasy that focuses on nature vs man conflict (between a forest's denizens and a society of outcasts), whereas Sword of the Stranger is a ronin adventure that focuses even more on action and on feudal wars (including conflict between Ming mercenaries and locals). 
Both take place in same period. There is a relationship between the MCs of not trusting each other at the beginning. There are fights, not only duels but also with armies, which are well animated. Princess mononoke is more fantastical and sword of the stranger, more realistic "

Both movies by the same creator and both exhibit machinery candy and a cute romance 
They have falling heights, floating, supporting and good style of characters. And both about moving castles. 
Both anime are directed by Hayao Miyazaki. As such, they have similar art styles and plot elements. Both anime show a romance developing between the two main characters. Also, the soundtrack for both anime is composed by Joe Hisaishi. Also, both have something to do with unique castles. "

Fantasy feel.  Parent moving out to an old home in the countryside with their two young children (very similar scenes here). 
Both movies have a beautiful mix of slice of life and fantasy with a heavy focus on a single (or acting as a single) parent caring for two adventerous children in a rural mountain village. Ookami Kodomo can definitely be compared to Miyazaki's works and feels to me like a modern-day Totoro. 
Both concern the coming of age theme in it and the characters' move to the country to live in a traditional japanese house that is hidden away from neighbors. Also Young Yuki reminded me a lot of Mei, both having very similar personalities. I got the same heart warming feeling watching both of these movies 
Nothing is explicitly similar about these two movies, but they both have a slice-of-life type of feel and a very calming atmosphere, as the characters are isolated in the country for most of the movie. They both deal with the relationship between humans and nature, and feature two adorable children being raised by one parent. However, some (minor) differences to note are that Wolf Children revolves more around the mom, rather than the children,while Totoro focuses on the children. Wolf children is also sadder and more emotional than Totoro. 
The plot of both movies takes place in a rural area of Japan and both talk about childhood with fantasy elements. 
Two of the greatest anime films, both brimming with magic and wonderful understated moments. They never get too dark, so both provide a healthy dose of family-friendly entertainment. 
Both of these movies have similar themes of family and growing up. Totoro is more geared towards kids while Wolf Children appeals to adults more (specifically parents). This also means that Totoro is more lighthearted and fun while Wolf Children is somewhat on the serious side, although it still has plenty of funny/cute moments. These two movies also have similar settings, featuring a parent with two kids in a house near the forest. The soundtracks are very different, but both sound great and really help boost the impact of important scenes. I would also say that these two movies are the best animated movies of their respective decades. read more 
They have a similar narrative: Rural life and family with supernatural touches. Both are highly recommended.  
They feel very much alike, both being about some familial issues and giving off this hopeful and very soothing atmosphere. 
What the countryside brings. Rather than a similar plot, both My Neighbor Totoro and Wolf Children both follow a family moving out to the countryside.Whilst My Neighbor Totoro does this at the very start of the movie, Wolf Children does this due to the pressure from other people in raising Wolf Children.Both are good interesting anime with My Neighbor Totoro being a wholesome adventure. Wolf Children being more dramatic. "

Both are peaceful stories exploring the relationship between humans and the supernatural 
For some reason I kept thinking of Totoro when I watched this series. Both have great artwork, and unique characters. There are some very Miyazaki-esque characters in Natsume Yuujinchou - and both the movie and the series have good stories. I'd really recommend both these for someone wishing to experience something a bit more unique from an anime "

Both movies take place in rural japanese environments and revolve around the main character's interactions with yokai/supernatural beings.

Okay, they are not that similar, since My Neighbor Totoro is more like a fantasy/adventure movie, while Barakamon is a slice of life/comedy. But both of them have a very light atmosphere which helps to reduce stress. Also, the two animes take place in the countryside and have, as one of the protagonists, a little girl who is very cute and highly curious, and brings troubles to the other protagonist of the story.  "

There are two work produced by Production IG, type Action, Sci-Fi, Police.Artwork antisipation deal about the evolution of human behavior and society in parallel with the technological advances and problems that responsibility.(translated from french) 
Both take place in post apacolyptic setting, includes adavanced robots/AI and has a good and action packed story 
I recommend it because it's in the same cyberpunk and psychological sphere. 
both are similar in action and having strong female lead characters. 
Both of these anime have similar settings, and feature a smart female detective as the leading protagonist. They have similar themes about the problems prevalent in a society which relies too heavily on technology. After all, there are always bugs or loopholes that can be taken advantage of. The art and sound in both are brilliant as well. Finally, the most notable similarity are the heavy philosophical themes in both shows. GitS and PP both analyze human society, and also try to define humanity itself. 
If you like sci-fi thrillers that involve complex plots and dilemmas for an hypotetic future civilization, with philosophyc touches, this is what you are looking for. Both are about police units and their struggles to resolve complex crimes. Both have a great ambientation with strong cyberpunk inspiration. Both soundtracks are great. Both have a great plot and characters. 
Both introductions to carefully crafted universes, that seduce you through their effervescent world building and master class study of the hypothetically futuristic human condition, and never quite let go. 
A cyberpunk relation regarding both shows is established, as well as a futuristic setting. The formulation of thought apropos human thought; what it is to be human Vs the 'society', how the society would view you for being any different from anyone else. One may recommend SAC (Ghost in the shell), but the movie is a much better relation. 
They both take place in a similar futuristic setting and ask questions about society. 
Psychology based on robot and ia through sf 
Both deal with a futuristic setting and deal with the philosophy of humanity, morality and choices. 
Both deal with philosopical questions, have rather violent and graphic content and if you liked Ghost in the shell id guess you'll love Psyco pass since it actualy has a gripping narration and plot progression unlike ghost in the shell wich looses itself a bit to much in dialouge. 
Great philosophy. Mind boggling plot and visuals. And also its detective/police works. I fr am at loss of words because this is a MASTERPIECE.  "
43,30,6,"They are both extremely dark anime.  They're both futuristic (in different ways) and both are disturbing in their own ways. 
Eva and GitS have a pretty similar feeling, as you can see by their common tags (Psychological, Drama, Mecha, Sci-Fi, etc...). The biggest difference I see is that GitS doesn't go through all the supernatural part of Evangelion.They have almost the same age also and are being revived these times with new stuff, such as movies/episodes. Even though Eva is much more popular, GitS don't lose in any points to the so claimed series. If you loved to see all that questioning you had on Eva, GitS is one shot you can't lose. 
Similar dark vibe in psychological..  you watch this  
Both pose some serious questions about the human psyche and are set in the future, although in different ways. Neon Genesis is a bit more carefree while Ghost is the Shell is kinda dark. Ghost in the Shell also involves human/robot cops over mecha and focuses on the problems between humans and machines. 
Both are cult classic 90's anime, set in a futuristic world. Both are very dark and psychological, featuring a lot of symbolism and philosophy. Both create a similar atmosphere and give off a similar vibe.

I recommend Perfect Blue mostly because I watched the two almost back to back and while I personally think Perfect Blue is the better film it's quite a bit darker than Ghost in the Shell. I enjoyed them both immensely and I feel you will too. So in summary, both films while lacking in obvious similarities are close in their story telling styles and the underlying exploration of the mind, be it human or the ghost in the machine. I hope you enjoy them both as much as I did. read more 
Both are very dark, grimy and don't shy away from showing violence and naked human flesh.And both have realistic design. 
Both include a female lead who looses their sense of identity and dissociates themselves from their reality.  "
31240,9253,102,"Beginning with the obvious, both Re:Zero and Steins;Gate were animated by the same studio, White Fox and both main protagonists have time traveling related abilities.Now for the juicy stuff, both Okabe and Subaru are quite different from the usual anime protagonist and aren't meant to be self-inserts for viewers. They both must overcome obstacles to save the ones they love and both feature thrilling story lines and engaging characters that break the mold of most anime tropes like Tsunderes (with Steins;Gate's Kurisu) and Moé characters (Re:Zero's Rem). The authors want you to see the MCs go through very difficult (and sometimes gory) hardships in order to reach their goals. In a nutshell both are:- Animated by White Fox- Time Traveling Related- Have fresh Non-Self Insert Protagonists- Mold Breakers of Anime Tropesand both anime titles have a thing for colons and semi-colons.  read more 
Butterfly effect 
Time traveling is always a popular theme for anime.But it is risky because it can cause a lot of plot holes.Then again those two anime don't have a problem about that at all.Both mc have similar goal and reason for using time travel again and again.Steins;Gate hasn't got any real fight scenes but it has much philosophical approach about time travel.Both are done by the same studio so animation style is similar too. 
Both anime revolve mostly around an ordinary guy who does his best to protect those he cares about, no matter how many times he has to do it:- Both Guys who are suddenly caught in a spiral of disastrous events- Both have something to do with the Butterfly Effect/Travelling back in time- Both MC's are pretty powerless and non-significant at first - Both MC's will stop at nothing to save those they care about  
Essentially similar concept. Re:Zero is basically Steins;Gate meets KonoSuba. 
Similar theme of live die repeat. In case of steins gate he doesnt get to do the dying part.-Both mc's start to lose it after a while.-A romatic relationship is slowly forming with the mc in bith shows.-Steins;Gate is more of a sci fi and re zero more of a fantasy anime.-Both can be very dreadful and life draining at times.-The ending is spectacular in both shows.All and all if you enjoy the one I believe you will enjoy the other one. Steins;Gate can be difficult to watch specialy early on but dont give up. The end is what matters. 
Re:Zero and Steins;Gate featured an MC with similiar power: time travel. And the 'time travel' aspect of these series isn't just some cool sci-fi material, it has a little dark element attached to it: 'death'. Both MC tried to save people around them from the hand of the reaper, they also touched upon the psychological aspect of the MC as the only one who remember the events from before the timeline is altered. Also, both series are produced by the same studio and have fantastic, fluid animation. However, while Steins;Gate is a bit slow on the beginning, Re:Zero show its dark element right on the very first ep. read more 
well, if i tell will be a spoiler, but just knows that both are good and the ""time travel"" envolving a friend is ""similar"" 
If you like watching someone getting desperate to save everything by some kind of ""time-travel"" you would love this show instantly. 
Despite opposite settings, both of these series feature time looping as the main plot device and strong character development, plus similar themes of selflessness and looking forward rather than behind. 
Both of these animes have the same theme of going back in time to save a life, but in one the person has to die in order to change time while the other simply has to microwave a burrito. Other than that the series as a whole seems completely different. 
Unlike Re:Zero, Steins;Gate a well-written time-travel thriller. If you think Re:Zero is good, then you clearly haven't watched Steins;Gate or Madoka Magica.  
“Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu” and “Steins;Gate” have the concept of going back in time. Problems are always arising for the main characters. Whenever they think they can catch a break, something around them has to go wrong. Furthermore, their mental state will be affected from seeing the people around them suffer. With that being said, these anime can have a very dark and serious tone. While “Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu’s” storyline is set in a fantasy world, “Steins;Gate” focuses on a real life aspect. 
In Steins;Gate the mc makes a time leap machine and the plot becomes saving his friend by time leaping. In re:zero, The mc also uses time leap to save his friends. In the both series, they need to figure the way how to save people. In rezero, by triggering specific events, meanwhile in Steins;Gate by redoing his actons.  
If you've seen them both then you'll know this is an obvious comparison.Slight spoilers for story premises here, but nothing that would ruin either for you if you haven't seen them yet.Both of these Anime are by White Fox, and have more or less the same story structure and premise: The main character has the power to rewind time somehow, and this interferes with the natural order of things. As such, they lose people they care about, and end up going back again and again, growing increasingly desperate, as they try to get the perfect result.Both stories have a great deal of intrigue and mystery to them as well and are, at least in my opinion, utterly unpredictable.Both well worth watching, I highly recommend both. read more 
Both shows have a very similar concept around them. Steins;Gate and Re:Zero are both produced by the same studio, White Fox. The main protagonists of both shows can act like goofballs at times, but become serious and dependable when it comes to helping others out. I don't want to say too much as it's best to go into both of these shows blind and I definitely recommend both of them. Steins;Gate and Re:Zero are both fantastic shows produced by White Fox though Re:Zero is very controversial at times. This is only my opinion though. 
the similarities1)same studio2)same topic- time travel3)both the MC travels time to save someone.4)both the MC are goofy but when the situations calls they become serious.difference1)Steins;gate is a science fiction while Re:zero is a fantasy. 
Time travel concept, similar animation styles and made by the same studio ( white fox studio). Both also have a complex plot and interesting story. 
Both have to do with going back in time to save someone they care about. The protagonists are both funny and goofy but have a darker tragic side. However,Re:Zero has more gore and takes place in a fantasy environment and Steins;Gate is more realistic. 
Someone at White Fox be like: ""You guys remember this anime about time travel we made few years ago, that everybody loved? Let's do that again!"" 
Similar in that both main characters have the ability to travel back in time ,and that they use that power to try to save a loved one. 
A goofy, but series when the time calls protagonist gets himself into a time travel loop where he must save his closest compatriot. 
-both are related to different worldline and travelling back time-both the MC are air headed but serious in tough situations-both MC travel back time to save someone-both shows have really cute girls... and interesting plot and twist.... 
Both start happy and lighthearted but descend into madness.The main character undergoes extreme stress, due to certain events.Both involve time travel and returning to the same time.The main guys have many similarities.Both involve a romance.Both have a cat girl named F(a/e)ris and a trap. 
- Both have dimensional travel- Dark elements.However, steins;gate focuses more on time travel as Re:Zero focuses on fantasy and dimensional travel.  
The vibe from both series are very alike; intense, hilarious and much more. The main characters are also very similar; they are not afraid to speak their mind to express themselves, and they often go out of their way to help other people. What's more similar is that both series deal with time-travel where the main character is able to go back into time to make better decisions to avoid similar incidents of occurring again.  
Great plot with time travel stories.A main character tries to save the person that he loves by the time leap. 
-Both feature hilarious protagonists-Both involve... hmm... how shall we say this without giving to much away.. A way of 'resetting'-Made by the same studio, similar art style-Start slow but reveal the truth later 
They both have time travel where the main character must go back mutiple times. 
- Mayushii always suffering- The local MC always suffering too but he lived from his checkpoint- Immature MC- Cringy MC 
In both anime the main character starts from the beginning each time he fails to save his beloved person, both see them die again and again in multiple ways and that experience takes its toll, They both lose hope at one point but someone gives them the courage to not stop and continue. 
Trime travel plays a major role in both animes. Rintarou Okabe and Subaru Natsuki are able to travel backward in time in order to save someone they care about. This time travel happens multiple times throughout the anime. 
-Both anime tell about LIVE - FAIL/DIE - REPEAT sequence.-Both main character try to save someone that important to them using time machine (for Steins;Gate) and using checkpoint (for Re:Zero).-Both anime contain a lot of emotion, especially desperation, fear, and love.-Both anime have most popular waifu (Kirisu for Steins;Gate and Rem for Re:Zero). 
Made by the same studio, Re:Zero may not be as great as Steins;Gate but many elements such as time travel and a wacky main character are still present 
Both Animes follow similar time travel theme where MC can go back and still remember the other timeline to accomplish a goal. I would also mention Madoka being in the same league. P.S. this is my favorite genre 
Both the series , the guys have an ability to go back to the past , in both the series the girls are targeted for their life , in both the series the guys go back again and again to prevent the deaths of their nakama , and in both the series they reach success but by passing through a long line of pain !! 
Two incredible series about time-travelling and the absolute chaos that attempting to change the past can do to one's psyche. They're both mature series with fantastic story-telling, characters, music, and art. Steins;Gate is in my opinion the superior of the two due to its superior story-telling and cast, but Re:Zero is fantastic in its own right. 
Carismatic main character that sometimes acts like an air-headed but it's not, at least not that much. Time traveling, deaths, same studio, interesting plot. 
The two main protagonists, Okabe and Subaru, work with time whether it is through a machine or an ability (There is more similarities with this. However, I will leave it a surprise.). The story revolves around take action and changing the future, otherwise known as the Butterfly Effect. Both animes are made by the same studios and are enjoyable to watch after the first few episodes. 
The male protagonists are very alike, as they share the traits of being humorous, caring, energetic, and emotional. The female protagonist believes in the male protagonist, which is something both anime share as well. Both shows have a lot of humor now and then, and they also have mysteries that the protagonists have to solve through thorough investigation. In the end, I honestly think that if you loved Steins;Gate, you most likely will love Re: zero as well. Not only that, they are from the same studio. The only difference between the two is the setting and the difference darkness between the two anime. Re: Zero is mostly the definition of Steins;Gate and the fantasy world. My favorite of this season, as I love deep and dark psychological anime. If you love dark and psychological anime, you most definitely will like this as well. read more 
Both have the same concept about going back in time to save the one you love and you will get the same in the end 
Both have almost the same concept of time travel. A guy who travel to past to save his friends from death.The idea is: if you liked Re:Zero, you might love Steins;Gate 
Before you click away because you're thinking, 'this can't be an accurate recommendation', just hear me out. There's only one thing that these two have in common: redo parts of life to save the ones you love.  It sometimes may seem impossible to keep on going, but keep trying and don't give up - this is the core message in both. So if you like these kind of underlying messages (like I did), you won't regret watching them. 
Both have persistent MCs that travel in the time to save others suffering in the process but without surrendering and always moving forward 
Compelling portrayals of despair and the growing feeling of madness and regret over one's actions repeated over a time loop. Also, both White Fox productions. 
Both are time travel series.Both have the concept of going back in time to save someone.Hilarious protagonists that are total air heads XDBut there is a difference in the way that use to return the time back in re zero he must die and return to chikpont its more like Gamebut in steins:gate they  Using scientific ways that are more realistic 
Same animation studio, time travel elements, quirky characters, psychological impact of tragedy on the characters.  
Rather than being able to time-travel, Re:Zero gives Subaru(Main character) the ability to ""reset"" time up to a particular point as soon as he dies.Similar to Steins;Gate, the main protagonists are both thrown in the dilemma of going through trials again and again to obtain the desired result. However, this journey of trying to get the best situation affects their character and drains them of their ""Humanity"" at some point.Events will unfold as their journey continues. 
Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu is probably the most popular anime released during the summer of 2016. From watching both Steins gate and Re:zero I've noticed how both the Main Characters go back in time some how to stop current events from happening. Steins Gate is by far the most confusing anime I've every seen, even episode 1 was very confusing, but everything makes sense when they explain it around the middle part of the series. If you are looking for romance in Steins Gate, then theres not that much at the beginning but there is quite a lot of romance towards the end. Steins Gate is also one of the most ""Feels"" anime I've seen. Be sure to check it out! I'd rate Steins Gate 9/10 read more 
It reminds me a little to re: zero only that the protagonist in my opinion is better developed.really the characters will like you, as much as its history.Thanks to this, I fell in love with travel in time.It is a masterpiece.I only saw myself this season, I have to see the rest but I'm content to see that end. 
Arguably the best time travel story I have ever had the pleasure to watch, Steins;Gate offers the time traveling thriller story with genuinely interesting characters without using as much gore as portrayed in Re:Zero.  
Same ""Time-Reset"" Mechanic and psychological Elements. 
Both shows are about how time travel has consequences, and can cause emotional stress for the time traveler. Re:Zero has more fantasy than science, but if you want a show to give you similar feels to Steins;Gate, this is the show. 
Both the MC have the chance to alter the future to save someone who is precious to them. 
In both of them, there is a time travel relation 
Both have a return to previous area plot device. If you are into an anime that involves going back into time then you are in the right place. 
Both share a high level of comedy and writing. But what really links these shows are the main characters. They start off with a (seemigly) happy MC surrounded by friends they care a lot for. Then said friends die. Again. And Again. And Again. Inability to change the past leads to worsening mental states as they begin fighting not only fate, but themselves as well. In Steins;Gate this only happens in the second half of the show; in Zero, it's the whole thing. If you liked Okabe's character deconstruction and are looking for something similar, then I highly recommend this show. Just beware, it's a very dark show, despite what the first few episodes might lead you to believe. read more 
Both are made by the same studio and involve constantly going back in time to change the future and save a character. Both MCs put up a facade of confidence to hide their insecurities (even from themselves). Time traveling in mentally taxing on both characters. 
Very interesting takes on ""time travel"" 
Both were made by the same studio, basically meaning there are similarities in the animation quality.Both of the main characters face the tragedy of failing to save the people they care about over and over again.Both deal with the usage of time travel. 
Firstly both anime is produced by the same studio. MC has similar time traveling related abilities. Author represents how both mc stuggles through hardship again again to save the person they care about. Both anime have it's beautiful share of characters that are loveable. Gives of a similar vibe even though both are not from the same genre! 
Plot Heavy and Time Travel or the idea of messing with Timelines is explored!  
Both shows follow their main character through traumatic events where they end up going back in time to fix their mistakes only to make more. As they attempt to fix all of their problems, they end up suffering from the consequences of altering history. 
Both animes have the main character attempting to save what he loves the most, and they both go through a series of serious torment, confusion and desperation in order to achieve his goal while the other characters are almost clueless on why the main character is acting different all of a sudden. 
To be honest since seeing Steins;Gate I have been looking for a psychological thriller along the same lines. With that in mind, now I've seen Re:Zero it's definitively in the same ballpark. Both have lead male protagonists that travel through time to try and save their loved ones while continuing to be effected by the pain of losing them over and over. The shows also have very well fleshed out character and story development along with a broad range of emotion. Many comedic, mysterious and dark tones make the feel of the shows to be parallel.  
Both have got time travelling and a protagonist who wants to save their friends and they are truly caring about their friends and cares nothing but their friends 
They both have time travel elements. Both characters go through similar revelations and events and have huge character development. Both are thrilling and I recommend you watch it if you love this. 
these two anime have a match in terms of the storyline where the main character is stuck in the failure of the rescue of the person he loves that makes this anime may be no different is the two anime is in production by the same studio 
I don't think there's anything similar to Steins;Gate but one of those shows that made me feel at least some of the feels i have with Steins;Gate is Re:Zero. It has a totally different way of traveling back to the past, and is amazing, i totally recommend it. 
In both Anime there are main caracters who can travel through time. To save their friends they are forced to make mentally depressing experiences.  
Both series focus on the protagonist who comes into a situation where he has time travel powers. Both Subaru and Okabe go trough a lot of suffering trying to overcome the obstacles they face. As the viewer you get attached to the characters and just really want both protagonists to succeed and find happiness and get an end to all their suffering. Eventually both protagonists find friends that support them no matter what, even if they don't know everything the protagonist knows. Like that Subaru manages to get trough thanks to Rem and Emilia, while Okabe is supported by Kurisu trough all world lines.If u like character driven time travel stories you'll definitely enjoy both steins;gate and re:zero. If you liked either one I'm pretty sure you'll like the other too read more 
Both of these animes had made me scared and excited while watching. If you like steins;gate you will definitely love re:zero. Both characters possess an incredible power about time and space. 
In Re;zero, the explanations are a bit lesser than Steins;gate but both anime have a same kind of thing. They both have Time-travelling things & changing the past type option. Both are very inspirational for people who thinks to change their past or wants to change as a better version of them selves. At the starting, you might not understand it fully & might wanna quit watching but take my reccomendation & continue watching to episode 18 in Re;zero, I'm damn sure it'll become one of your favourite anime. 
same studio, both related to time, both are rollercoasters of a ride (and can get pretty dark). Both are gureto 
Despite having very different settings, both series feature a similar plot structure in which the MC finds himself repeatedly going back into time to protect those he cares about. The MCs are similar personality-wise, and both series explore the psychological ramifications of failing multiple times. 
if you want an anime with perfect character development (and that contributes to their deconstruction later), interesting plot twists that leave you stuck all the time, an intelligent anime that makes you think full of hidden messages and the best protagonists of all times, steins;gate is the right choice 
Both shows are centered around the use of some kind of time travel (such as time loops) by the protagonist to save their loved ones; Re:Zero is basically Steins;Gate in an isekai. Both shows feature some amount of suffering, and they were both animated by studio White Fox. 
Both have main characters that travel back in timeBoth have main characters that suffer a lot throughout the seriesBoth have main characters that try to protect all of there friends Both have main characters that travel back in time to save a girlBoth have main characters with Chūnibyō personalities If your looking for a main character that's similar to Hououin Kyouma or Subaru check out either one. 
Both anime has similar type MC that suffers for saving his dear peoples.Both MC's are great & Masterpiece.Highly recommended anime and also must watch for you. 
Both involve time travel (kind of) and trying to save their friends and loved ones with it. 
In both animes the plot revolves around going a few days in the past to change future events. 
Both are fantastic thriller animesInvolve changing the pastThe main character suffersMade by White Fox 
-Both anime revolve around using time travel (time looping as the main plot).-Subaru & Okabe both go through hell to save their love ones. -Both protagonist are powerless and selfless because they’ll go through lengths to save their loved ones. -Both anime are animated by White Fox and have a similar premise  Steins;Gate & Re:Zero both have that dark gloomy and eerie tone to the story. However, Re:Zero has more gore and takes place is a fantasy world. Whereas, Steins;Gate is a SCI-Fi thriller and feels more realistic due to the art style and setting. Also, the fundaments of time travel is better explored in S,G.  read more 
The main characters both travel back in time to save someone or to prevent something. ya 
The plot is very sad and exciting, exactly like S; G, also the ""return to the past"" mechanics reappears present in -Steins; Gate 
Both main protagonists have time traveling related abilities. 
Both anime main charachters go the past about a day or two and having mental problems 
Both of those anime talks about that protagonist who go back in time over and over and over, to solve some problem will happen, and save himself and his friends.  
Both are about time traveling and life saving but one is simp other is Mad  
-both have the try over again and again kind of thing going on-both feature proper waifu material 
In these anime the protagonist has to suffer through repetition of  situations where their close ones are endangered or even die. The protagonist to find a way to fix the situation. Both involve time travel. 
Both Shows have the similar concepts People trying to make it past a certain situation that they are struggling to get past, both Protagonists have a ability to remember the past, Have loveable characters and world development. 
In both title, you'll see the main character go through some real deal. The support and other MC's are also a good complement to the story. 
In Both anime the male MCs has to go in the past again and again(and suffer a lot{specially in Re:Zero}) to save their love however one is scientifically developed story and the other is fantasy, But still if you are looking for well developed time travel stories this is where you should definitely go.    
Same psychological/mystery vibe to them. Both have some episodes which end with cliffhanger or plot twist. 
Steis;Gate and Re:Zero both deal with the similar concept of time travel in their own ways.Both are made by the same top tier studio and each do a great job at adapting their novel counterparts. I recommend both these shows for any fan of psychological and philosophical thrillers. 
1) Both male MCs can initiate time travelling(with the exception of some cases occurringaccidentally)2) Both male MCs initiate time travelling to help their friends (all female)3) Both TV shows have a female character which is very supportive of respective male MCno matter which world lines they are in (although they both hate the respective maleMC at the beginning of both TV shows but end up loving them, which is a classic plot) 
TIME TRAVEL  is possible in both and only main characters can do itBoth mc have 2 cute girls O_OBoth Mc sees the person they love will die and gonna save themBoth mc have same personalityAnd you love both anime 
it's like begin something from the bottom then fail and repeat or restart 
Let’s do more screwing around with time travel! That’s pretty much what goes on in Steins;Gate, in which a bunch of psuedo-scientists stumble upon a device that allows them to communicate with the past and alter the flow of history.But the goal of the cast here isn’t to prevent some major tragedy from occurring. Not at first, anyway. Eventually, all they’re trying to do is clean up their own mess, as their meddling brings all sorts of butterfly effect consequences to bear. 
- Both are involved with time- Both main protagonist- Both have big depression- Both have those hot girls ykOne difference is that one is a fantasy world and the other is in today's world so yeah I would recommend it if you like the other :) 
Both of these animes have a protagonist who can retry his recent actions in life. They are trying their best to reach the optimal ending, where no one dies.Re:Zero is an Isekai, Steins Gate is a Slice-of-life with sci-fi elements.Both have many bishoujo characters, they are partly harem-type. "
31240,31043,44,"Imagine a world where fate demands to be corrected and it is willing to go through an endless binding cycle to achieve that purpose. The curse of time travel being portrayed at its best where the ones involved either witness gruesome deaths or experience it themselves. Happy endings are hard to come by but the future remains uncertain, it is up to the individual to decide the closure they deserve.‘Boku dake ga Inai Machi’ showcases a game of cat and mouse that has seen it being dragged on for over 10 years in which all the tragedies that unfolded before us are planned by one single entity. The rich storyline that is full of substance accompanied by dark striking character expressions will undeniably leave your heart pumping while trying to anticipate the outcome of one’s action. ‘Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu’ convene its story through multiple layers of secluded mystery where it is not known how each event are related. Unlike ‘Boku dake ga Inai Machi’, this mystery-base story plays right into the show’s strength due to the final villain not being revealed blatantly while their true purpose remains an enigma. Commendation should also be given to the series with the way it prioritises its vision, the romance/harem is certainly noticeable but never overwhelm the true objective which is the storyline. Audience would certainly appreciate the character interactions and comedy which sets a lighter tone away from the frightening events that has all but left us bewitched. read more

Re:Zero have the same thing with revival even if is only if he is dying and not to save others too like in BokuMachi. 
While BokuMachi is set in our modern world and Re:Zero is in a fantasy world, both anime have the basic premise where the protagonist has the ability to reset their experience to a certain point in order to avoid a dead end. Further similarities lie in the fact that both characters have very little control on this phenomenon. Note that the series focus on using this ability to avoid bad end, rather than getting the bottom of this mysterious phenomenon. 
the deep story of change the past is here in a bigger way for only 12 episodes. Here we have the one, who only can time-skipping and we have the problem, wich have to distroy. But in Boku dake ga inai machi.. the protagonist has only one chance to help the person and change the past. Police/Detective/psychological/Mystery... here we can't find the genre 'comedy' 
A time loop going back in time to fix something or save someone 
Similar themes. The main character goes through the same timeline many times trying to save people and to set things right. Both of these shows have amazing cliffhangers and great art, and you'll watch one episode after another.The only difference would be that Re: Zero is set in a fantasy world with different races, magic and creatures, while Boku dake ga Inai Machi (Erased) is set in a world similar to the real one we live in. If you enjoy one, you'll likely enjoy the other, though. 
Time travel when a problem arises (in the case of Re;zero, it is due to death)! Very good at creating suspense towards the end of each episode. 
main character resets the progress made (kinda like travelling back in time) by dying, tyring to save the people dear to him. 
They are similar in the sense that the MC are able to change the history, It is also both breathtaking to know what will happen on the next episode. Consider it a different perspective everytime you watch. 
- Both are very dark Thriller shows...- Both has time-loop themes [ no, Re:Zero isn't time travel anime, look at Anime Man's video about this show ]- Both has male MC's who tries to save the people they care about.... [ Loooove xD ]- Both are pretty new/modern animes who reached TOP 100 in notime, they're pretty popular too..[ haters included :) ]- Ok, I won't lie that both shows has great OP's/OST's which will make you're ears orgasm by themselves [ ok, this is dumb but whatever ]- In both you somehow start to feel for MC's for what they went, kinda self-insert animes...- Both at very end of each and evey episode leaves you at big cliffhanger's...[ I think that's good ]- By the way, if you like graphical violence - this is for you, just don't expect 90's level of gore/curses and other non-moe stuff..> Re:Zero has 'fantasy' aspects like - all rpg creatures, magic and other stuff...while Boku dake.. is more 'real life' - modern day life without any magic/superpowers/monsters...> And Re:Zero has waifu's [ Ogre sisters are the best - so gtfo if you don't like it D ] read more 
Going back in time after a life threatening situation with a destiny and fate you are so called put in to save a life? This is the foundation of the plot concept that both Boku dake ga Inai Machi and Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu contain.   
Same ConceptCant tell too much otherwise it would ruin it but if if you liked Ereased This one should be your next target (Except it has EPIC FIGHTS) 
both tell about the return of the time that has passed and equally fight for what they want, protect and save those who are important to them 
Both main characters can travel in time and they do it because they want to save a person that they love 
Both anime have a few things in common. Dealing with time travel and a heroine going back in time to help someone special.The both have received good reviews and plenty of reason to watch. 
○ The protagonists have a similar power○ The protagonists aren't completely useless!○ Heavily focused on psychological/emotional elements○ Great shows of 2016! 
The protagonists in these series strive to make a good deed or to make a difference in the world.They both travel back in time if anything bad would have happened. They are taking a journey towards that difference that they would make.  
-Both involve a protagonist repeating the same 'scene' over and over again-In that sense, both are about leaping timelines-Some characters are similar (ex. Subaru leaping back to save Rem, Satoru leaping back to save Hinazuki) 
- Both have time travel themes.- Both protagonists want to use it to save people. - Both allow graphic violence. 
Anime almost have the same idea of traveling through time in order to save the lives of their friends who had died before the travel process through time. 
If you liked the mind-blown feeling when Satoru use time-travel to save the people he cared about, then you must watch Subaru using his Return by Death power in Re:Zero. Boku dake ga Inai Machi sets in the real world while Re:Zero showcase a young teenager got sent into a fantasy world mysteriously. Don't get fooled by the cliché of an MC getting involved in a fantasy because Re:Zero will offer lots of twists and turns when you least expect it. 
Ok, this may sound stupid but the only persuasive argument as to why I recommend this to Re: Zero was the concept of time loop that almost has the same concept as to Tom Cruise's ""At the edge of Tomorrow."" 
-Both have slimier stories -Both have great main character that could travel in time.. (for Re:zero it's dying.. but for boku it's screaming out loud i guess)But i prefer Re zero as the best of time travel anime's of all Time :"")   
Similar idea and great main characters in both. 
Both series involve the protagonist using time travel to solve their problems. Boku Dake ga inai Machi deals with heavier issues and more realistic issues (like bullying and child abuse) while Re:Zero is set in a fantasy and therefore the problems are more set in fantasy although still applicable to real life (discrimination). Both series are for anime fans that enjoy darker anime. 
These two stories revolve around the idea of traveling back in time and fixing what has happened in a previous life and the concept of the butterfly effect. With both anime protagonists trying to fix things right, many of their actions may have a wrong twist to them. They are both interesting to watch, either in the fantasy lands of Re: Zero or the twisted year of 1988 in Boku dake ga Inai Machi. 
Re:Zero is my favorite this spring 2016 and boku dake ga inai machi of winter 2016.. it really feels like im rewatching boku dake ga inai machi while watching Re:Zero but its only difference is the genres of these two.. Re:Zero is a dark anime while boku dake ga inai machi is not but Re:zero is still worth watching..  
Both involve time travel and the main character trying to go back and prevent the death of other main characcters.Just do it its only 13 eps boi 
Not only do these stories share a similar premise of going back in time to same your friends, but they also share many similar features as well, such as irredeemably evil villains. Also, both had a romance subplot that managed to piss off every single one of it's fans by deliberately not shipping everybody's OTP and sinking them faster than a discount refugee ship from Syria. If you can tolerate one, you can definitely tolerate the other! 
Protagonists are trying to save the whole of their friends and time travels  
Both revolve around time travel to erase past mistakes and fight for a better future. They have really good characters (with similar main characters) and animation, both have a very interesting and engaging story and you really get invested in whats going on. 
Both male lead is patheticBoth have revival powerBoth have two main heroine 
movies like final destination, rezero and this anime have one thing in common. the mc has to prevent tragedy based on his acquired knowledge of future events. if thats what youre looking for then rezero is the way to go 
THEIR CONCEPTS ARE QUITE SIMILAR BUT THE SERIES IS VERY DIFFERENT 
Although the universe of these two works has a completely different setting, they share interesting similarities.- Both deal with the supernatural element of returning in time in order to save people, although in Erased, Revival is activated by the death of people around, and not by the death of the protagonist.- In addition, in both works, the protagonists make use of the information gathered before the return in time and solve mysteries that allow them to follow the timeline forward.- Both Re: Zero and Boku Dake ga Inai Machi present a theme involving attitudes such as self-condemnation, suffering and explore the psychological of the protagonist resulting from his losses. This also makes the two characters extremely human.- Both protagonists, initially, show a greater difficulty in creating bonds with other people, although Erased focuses more on that element, in my opinion.- Both the protagonists' narratives, Satoru and Subaru, involve building and inspiring a heroic figure for those around them. In Erased, Satoru is inspired by Wonder Guy, while in Re: Zero, Subaru is based on what he means to Rem.- In both works, the perspective of a female character influences the main character's way of thinking. In Boku Dake ga Inai Machi, Airi Katagiri is talked about, while in Re: Zero, that role belongs to Rem (and Emilia, of course).- Both animes present heavy situations and cold reality, portraying very pertinent questions. This element is more seen in Erased, however, with the reality of mistreatment, bullying and the impacts of the lack of a paternal / maternal reference. read more 
Both shows have main characters go back in time to prevent certain events from happening in the future. 
Both animes are good and have the same time travel premise to save someone and are popular psychological animes. 
Fighting fate with time. Erased and Re:Zero are both excellent stories of fighting a determined fate via time travel.Both anime give a standard MC who ends up into an unexpected world. Erased has Satoru transport into 1988, with Re:Zero transferring Subaru to the foreign land called Lugnica. In these movements, both Satoru and Subaru use their gained time travel powers to change the worlds of before in hopes of keeping loved ones safe.With Erased being a murder mystery, Re:Zero is much more dramatic. All in all, both are great supernatural psychological anime with slow romance to spare.   
Mechanics of the return to the past present in both works, the many psychological attacks on the protagonist are very successful and exciting 
Both Invole a form of timetravel. while RE:Zero is a lot more dramatic and at times hard to watch (in a good way) Erased is a good story told to the end in one compact season. 
Erased and Re: Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu are the two anime whose main characters have the power of time travel and can change them, the two main characters in this anime also use the power of time travel to save the main heroine. Re: Zero has more action and dramatic scenes, while Erased has tense scenes and the main character has to think smarter to do something.  
Like Re:Zero, this is a series about someone who can reverse time to stop a tragedy before it happens. Satoru Fujinuma gets sent back to a few minutes before the tragic event, and has saved a number of people with his uncanny ability to be in the right place at the right time. 
In Re:Zero MC recruited  into different World and in Boku dake ga Inai Machi MC went to his primary student life.1.Both struggled hard to complete their mission.2.One has cute wifus and other has cute  story.3.So now what watch both animes "
31240,30,5,"While the plots are very different, and the genres of the Anime as well, I found very similar the two MCs (Shinj and Subaru).Both go under stress, anxiety and dangerous moment in which they will risk their lives. Both MCs experience mental breakdowns throughout the show because of ""someone forcing"" them to do something. There are many deaths. 
Both are desconstructions of its respective main gender(Isekai/Mecha), explores well protagonist psychological state with their suffering, have waifus, exceptional animation, 25~26 episodes and a lot of brutal deaths(the end of eva) that just influence protagonist's mental state even more. However, Evangelion is more focused on dementia while Re:Zero is on Thriller. 
What thing have in common Evangelion, Madoka Magica and Re:Zero? The three are a critic of their respective genres. The typical mecha anime show us a main character that is usually a hot-blooded teenager who gets in a robot and saves the world with it along with the power of love and friendship. In Evangelion we see that the idea of putting kids into giant robots is downright insane, a normal teenager can't be expected to mentally endure it.The typical magical girl (mahou shoujo) anime has as main character a young naive girl of pure heart who gets magical powers and saves the world with them. In Madoka Magica the idea of having young teenage girls fight to death to protect the world is just as crazy as it was with boys in robots, and even if you are a heroine with magical powers you are still human, so you still may suffer from selfish desires, and your emotions make you vulnerable, even with the power of love and friendship.The isekai (other/different world) anime, where our main protagonist usually is a japanese student/gamer/otaku/NEET/hihikomori that is transported to another world with the purpose to save it, acquiring powers and becoming the hero, (Sword Art Online for example), Re:Zero criticizes this. The show focuses on how a socially withdrawn nerd would really function in a fantasy world, expecting to be a hero, but carrying over all his personal flaws from our world, showing the spectator that he is a simple human trapped in a world he doesn't understand.This is my personal top 3 of anime that review his own genre and criticizes the cliches, if you are tired of watching plotless anime full of fanservice/ecchi, I recommend you to see the 3 above. read more 
Both MC's filter a bunch of people. Notice both shows have a 5/10 review at the top, both admitting their bias against the MC's, and both reviews have overwhelming votes. Pull up a picture of an IQ bell curve and you'll have an epiphany as to why.Anyway, both shows explore deeper into their respective genres. They both latch onto psychological themes and don't let go.Most of the cast is similar as well. Rem is literally Rei, struggling with reciprocation of feelings and Asuka/Emilia plays like a reflection of the MC. The downside is that the villains only play symbolic motives in the story.Both are great mystery thrillers that don't hand answer everything at the end. Re:ZERO's director tries to replicate Evangelion but sometimes falls flat. Now, if only Evangelion had a source material. read more 
Both anime has a mc who always deal with psychological mental breakdown. Both anime effect on your nerves once their psychological stuff hits  you. PS both anime has lots of great wifus.  "
31240,13125,4,"These series both explore supernatural psychological themes in a way that captivate their audience. While Re:Zero is focused on a style that combines fantasy, comedy, and dark events (meant for a less mature audience), Shinsekai Yori is a more realistic version of a psychological anime portayed in a rather serious way (meant for a more mature audience). The dark themes in common to both are interesting to watch so you will probably like the other. Both are masterpieces, but for different audiences. 
Similar overall feelings. Supernatural powers involved as well as how to make good use of them, fighting tactics etc. Music that suits perfectly to the atmosphere and mastered animation with cool effects. Sometimes you'll feel as lost as the characters. Almost same approach of mystery and psychology. 
These two series have moments that can give the audience psychological shocks (in different ways). Both Shinsekai yori and Re: Zero focus on supernatural aspects and have dark themes (Shinsekai yori is a lot more darker though). These two also have heart warming moments. Besides, these two series have wonderful art, music and scenes. The world-building concept too is Awesome! 
This recomendation pretends less to the actual themes of the series, and instead the feeling of hopelessness and deperation it instills at times. If youre the type of person who can enjoy a series even tho it makes you feel uneasy and sad at times youre probaly gonna be able to appreciate both of them. "
31240,30484,4,"In both the shows only the protagonist remembers the past events after time travelling.Both the shows show the protagonist get traumatised due to too much time travel. 
Both of these anime definitely has a lot of similarities, especially the characters of Okabe and Subaru. Both act outrageous to amuse the people around them and go through a lot of mental stress trying to save the ones they love. It's quite obvious Steins;Gate fleshed out its time travel element more and in case of Re Zero it's time travel with supernatural aspect. Both of these characters shows a similar type of ability - Subaru every time returns from death in a specific point of time functioning similar to Okabes time leap. Both deal with this despair feeling, and have contrived stories. You can take Re Zero as Steins Gate 3 with no time travel scientific mechanism but with a lot of sufferings and I mean a lot.  read more

6675,2001,9,"Every so often, an experience comes along that kicks you in the face. Gurren Lagann is brimming with adrenaline and GAR-fueled moments, and Redline might be the only other piece of animation that matches it in magnitude. A racing film at heart, there are intense action scenes and gorgeous visuals that raise the bar for animation in film. While its narrative is definitely lacking, I will guarantee that you will have a smile plastered onto your face by the end.Don't miss this film. 
Both series have similar artwork as well as crazy action that is out of this world.The main male protagonist from both series is also daring and courageous often willing to take risks. The female protagonists in both series also have similiar personalities.There are a lot of action scenes, drama, comedy, and some romance.Both series are very fast paced and contains a noticeable soundtrack. 
Both Redline and Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann (TTGL) have similar style of animation, that is the standard goodness of Gainax. TTGL and the movie focus on the action, much more than plot, and are something that would be enjoyed more if we just relax and watch the awesomeness. 
Gurren Lagann and Redline are similar shows in only a few aspects as the two are in different genres, Gurren Lagann being a mecha and Redline being a racing anime. They are also animated by different studios Gurren Lagann being done by Trigger and Redline being done by Mad House. Redline stands as a single movie with no extensions where as Gurren Lagann is a 27 episode series with multiple ovas, specials, etc. However both of them also have very crazy and unique art-styles; practically throwing colors everywhere. As well as the two sharing a very similar way of being told in how they both increasingly get more over the top with every minute you watch with both leading up to a mind-boggling finale that will only leave you thinking ""What a journey"". They also share the fact that you need to watch both at one point or another. read more

Although the plot and characters in TTGL are amazing, I feel the main reason many people love it so much is due to how much fun the show is to watch, and if anything can replicate how much fun watching spiral powered mechs combine is, it’s illegal space racing. Don't be turned away from Redline due it being about racing, to call the things they drive 'cars' is a vast understatement, and are as close to normal race cars as the Gurren is to an average mech.Both are over the top awesomeness incarnate and stay at full throttle the whole way through, with Redlines amazing animation showcasing this brilliantly.  read more 
Both anime feature an artstyle that resembles much some found in western animation (though TTGL's is more cartoony), have an exaggerated feel, over-the-top action, bright choices of colors and are manly in an enjoyable way. They also share various sci-fi elements and feature non-human races too. 
Fast-paced, really likable characters, a unique art-style and is simply full of personality.Both great in his own little world, give them a chance. 
Redline and Gurren Lagann share very similar aesthetics, style, and the same crazy love for speed and momentum which is so prevalent and heart-pounding and it isn't just coincidence since both anime share several key animators (Katsuya Yamada, Sushio, and Hiroyuki Imaishi).But while I can say that they share a similar style and aimation I also have to say that they are also pretty different with their executions since Redline is more of a thrilling 24/7 ride than Gurren Lagann which is a pretty deep and impactful show. "

Racing and good soundtrack "
28171,38691,6,"Both MCs are very passionate of their work and are not afraid to think out of the box to gain an advantage of a situation. They work their way around things that may seem impossible and will always see through things to the end. Their hard work and dedication is something that stands out from everyone else, which obviously attracts the attention from a variety of people naturally making them a leader of some sorts and a target for others. Many surprise moments and wow factors from both anime that will put you on the edge of your seat. 
Mundane made awesome. Both shows have protagonists that triumps over enemies with the help of wits and knowledge, not afraid to use unusual methods and of course are very smug about their victories. Both are original takes on the battle shounen genre. While Dr. Stone has battles done with the help of science, Shokugeki no Souma has battles done with cooking. 
Over-the top, yet still engrossing and believable in a way few other shows manage to achieve. How? Their secret lies in being faithful to real life where it really matters - science for Dr. Stone and cooking for SnS. Nerdgasms all but guaranteed! 
-Both feature similar protagonists-Both have similar exaggeration of mundane tasks like taking something out of the oven or completing an innovation-In both, the protagonist is overwhelmingly better at what they do (cooking, creating) than their companions (although this changes in later seasons of Food Wars), and they have a supporting character who they teach, alongside teaching the audience 
The way food is central in food wars, in the same way science is central in Dr. Stone. Both series feature main characters obsessed with reaching a higher level of understanding of these central elements. Much of the episodes are also spent in explaining the details behind how these central elements work, how the raw materials that construct a meal or a piece of technology function and their importance. 
Both MCs are enthusiasts, almost to and arrogant level, in what they do. For Senku it is science, and for Souma it is cooking. Both anime also use everyday activities as a theme, which isn't really done in shounen anime. The themes are both executed well which shows the beauty in science and cooking.Both MCs also have their own catchphrase. "
28171,20583,5,"Both of these stories follow a very energetic main character striving to become better at what they do (volleyball and cooking). These MC's never give up no matter the cost. There are a large variety of different characters in each anime that help the mc. And, of course, there are rivals as well. The music and intensity of the matches (volleyball matches, shokugeki matches) are very similar, but Shokugeki no Souma has more comedy to it. All in all, these just look and feel very similar. 
Though the theme of these 2 anime is very different, they both apply the same kind of formula. A lot of epic moments, suspense, comedy... In the end, there's not that much of a difference besides the actual theme. 
both of the series are comedies, there is competition and nerves but also a lot of funny scenes and jokes (rather good or bad) in both anime.you can have a laugh but also feel the pressure of the moment, eg a competition or, in Haikyuu, a match. both are kind of loose and relaxing to watch  
Even though both anime may have a different concept, they are actually pretty similar. Both anime are labelled as comedy and shounen. They both have interesting characters that you can connect to, even the rivals. At times, they both can get very intense and exciting. I find both of the MCs, Hinata and Soma adorable and confident. The openings also get you hyped. Both of these are about a talent, Haikyuu!! is about volleyball, and Shokugeki no Souma is about cooking. 
You won't understand a bit what's going on in either of the anime, but the hype would really hut your g-spot. "

○ Parody animes○ Action-packed○ Both MCs don't quite understand how amazing they are at what they do, and have weird motives rather than real ambition 
If you love One Punch Man I'm sure a lot of the reason was the hype you felt every time you watched the intro, every time you heard the OST, and every time a fight scene came up. I don't blame you for feeling that hype, One Punch Man is a fantastic show. I consider it to be the second best anime to come out of 2015; second only to Shokugeki no Souma or Food Wars. If you have not watched this show, fix that. Shokugeki no Souma is half-way between being a parody of a Shounen, and actually being a Shounen. It's a Shounen about food. And trust me, this is the most hyped you will ever get about food, Gordon Ramnsay's everything doesn't even compare. The OST is and the animation in the fight(cooking) scenes is just as amazing as OPM's, with the animation in general being better(if we are including the slice of life parts). I believe the story to be even better than OPM's, as well as the overall hype of the show(I will admit, Shokugeki may have the unfair advantage as it's 24 episodes long). I can honestly tell you that Shokugeki no Souma has the potential to be the best anime you watch for a long time, since I have yet to see a better one. I admit I put Steins;Gate and Cowboy Bebop at about the same level, but I don't consider them to be better or worse per se. I believe Shokugeki no Souma to be one of the best anime to ever grace this world despite its laughable concept and joking nature, and I believe that if you were to watch it there is a good chance you will feel the exact same way.Now, if you've watched Shokugeki no Souma and haven't seen One Punch Man, where've you been? Even though I don't consider it to be quite on Shokugeki's level, it's still a top tier anime. Easily in the top 10 of 2015 almost regardless of who you ask. I personally consider it to be the second best of 2015, and if you are looking for some more of that hyped feeling after finishing Shokugeki, this is the perfect anime for you. The OST is just as good Shokugeki's and the animation in the fight scenes is just as good as the animation in Shokugeki's cooking scenes. One Punch Man also does not take place in a high school, so you could have a small break from that. Fantastic anime, almost perfect parody of a shounen, and completely worth the re-re-watch.  read more "

However, the character Sendo Takeshi shares many of Joe's qualities such as his violent past, his entourage consisting of local children, and his fighting style. Just like how Karate Kid and Rocky were partially done by the same staff, you can make some comparisons to here as well. While Ashita no Joe tends to have more of the qualities of the Rocky series, Hajime no Ippo tends to have more of the charms of the Karate Kid series.   
Before Hajime no Ippo there was Ashita no Joe, same theme about boxing and only boxing with a little dash of romance.If you like Hajime no Ippo you will most likely love Ashita no Joe season 1 and 2. 
-Both are about boxing and have some phenomenal and memorable fighting scenes.-Joe tackled darker themes while Ippo was more on the shounen side.-Few settings and characters are somewhat similar.-If you can get through the slow pacing and the old animation of Joe you might actually enjoy it.Probably, not as much as Ippo but still. Joe is still a good classic but, hard to swallow for some people. 
Great tale of young man and his road to becoming a boxing champion, suffering thought hardships on the way but pulling through not only thanks to their willpower, but also thanks to the support and advices from others. Ashita no Joe inspired many sports anime in general, so Hajime no Ippo certainly got inspired by it too.

Another thing that connects them is that they're very harsh in how they treat their characters, simply not everyone can achieve their dreams, and some dreams have to be crushed for anothers to succeed. Ashita no Joe and Ping Pong both make their characters come to grips with the reality of that fact. If you like one you're nearly guaranteed to like the other so long as you give them a chance despite what make them unappealing at first glance (In Ping Pong's case it's the art style, and in Joe's case it's the episode length and age) I even can stand testament to this since both of these are in my top 3 anime of all time. read more 
Both are character driven stories focusing on a talented, but rude and hotheaded protagonist. In both there are points where the character is an irredeemable asshole, but they are humbled after defeat and work harder to achieve their potential.  
Both animes focus mainly on their characters, not on the sport itself (which is used to maximize the characters).  "
2402,5941,2,"Hard-hitting and realistic sports anime with stories that make full use of ordinary life. Ashita no Joe is about boxing while Cross Game is about baseball, but they're much more similar than it may seem.  
Although they are different sports, Ashita no Joe and Cross Game, are very similar, dealing with how the daily life of their characters is presented, showing all the evolution in its maturity. The drama is also one of the focuses of Cross Game, although it is more intense in Ashita no Joe. "
3002,1535,31,"Both animes are very similar to each other, both heroes plot an ingenius plan to survive, both keeps you guessing until the end and hunger for the next one, both has amazing storyline. Kaiji is a genius anime without the supernatural stuff from Death note. 
The best of the best in terms of psychological mind-game series. They don't come any better than these two; Kaiji's initially alarming yet charming big-nosed art style aside. When you include One Outs, it's fair to say that Madhouse are THE studio to go to for detailed schemes and counter-scheming internal monologues. The tense intensity, which is amplified by the amazing soundtracks (same composer) and Kaiji's 'zawazawa' / narration, is truly something. Two aspects of Death Note and Kaiji differ from each other. The first is that DN has a supernatural edge while Kaiji does not. The second is Light (DN's lead) and Kaiji's (titular lead) personalities. Where as Light is so brilliant only his arrogance and an autistic rival genius can bring him down as he kills everyone in his path, Kaiji is a gullible loser. They couldn't be more different as people. To give an example, the very first game scenario occurs in Kaiji because Kaiji is in debt after co-signing a loan and is then tricked into entering a 'money or slavery', do-or-die gamble. The simplest way of explaining the series' differences is that Kaiji is always an underdog (hence the 'Ultimate Survivor'). Light, on the other hand, always holds all the cards.Of course, the above doesn't mean anything negative about Kaiji as a series. If anything, finding yourself willing on a loser and always being surprised over how he snatches victory from the jaws of defeat is more involving than watching a character such as Light win almost on auto-pilot as he attempts to become a God. We all love an underdog. What does matter is the mind-games themselves, and mind-games are where Kaiji excels. Where as Death Note didn't have any outright games to be dueled over with rules and winners, Kaiji does. There are three separate games in the first season and the stakes increase with each new challenge, to the point where they become life or death and every choice becomes agony, despite them being seemingly straightforward... but there's always a catch. It becomes so gripping you have to marathon the series.  read more 
Same style of psychologically outwitting your enemies.  Kaiji needs to be seen by more people, it is truly great. 
Death note is a complicated strategy/mystery show in which people must constantly think ahead of one another to survive. 
Although the plot is completely different, the similarities lie in brilliantly intelligent and original storylines. Death Note has you on the edge of your seat with the tension and Kaiji will get you doing exactly the same. You never know what will come next and it's strategical plot is immensely engrossing. Don't be put off by the art style of Kaiji, you won't regret watching this hidden gem. 
Both animes are very intellectually based, also the main character in both have to think several steps ahead to stay alive. 
In both anime moves of heroes are based on logic, and an insignificant mistake can cost the their lives. 
The series use the same exact fuel to power the plot, and that fuel is mind games. If you love super smart characters battling each other out in a game of life and death only using their brains, both series are for you. I have not yet seen anything that would stand to Death Note's level of depth and complexity in thinking over the next step of your opponent, but Gyakkyou Burai Kaiji comes VERY close. I have been looking for a series like this ever since I watched Death Note, and finally when I got to it I had no regrets. Obviously both series are a little different. Death Note has a very distinct thriller vibe to it with almost no place for humor in it. Kaiji brings a bit of that black humor, contrasting it with some very serious and dark episodes that I would say are way beyond Death Note's level of DARK. All in all, Gyakkyou Burai Kaiji is the first anime that comes to mind when someone asks if I know anything similar to Death Note. The drawing style may be completely different, but the plot and shenanigans between the main character and the antagonists (and the world as well) is what makes the experience akin.  read more 
These two are masters of suspense. They are both fantastic thrill rides that will leave you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. Kaiji obviously has much lower stakes, but somehow it manages to make you feel as though the world will truly end if things don't go according to plan. The music is done by the same composer, and it fits both perfectly. If you are in the mood for tension, mind-games, and psychological thrills, then either of these are a perfect fit.  
Both series have like a protagonist a super-genius guy, who have to use his inventive to resolve different kinds of problems, it feels the same atmosphere in both series, a normal guy who's life suddenly change in a short period of time, while in death note it's because of a supernatural thing, in kaiji it´s a most normal problem, money. I highly recomend both series. 
brain twisting and complex strategic plot 
The similarity between these two anime can be explained in an extremely simple manner. They give the same feeling when you watch them. They give the same rush the same thrill. The need to watch the next episode. The need to watch more. The same level of enjoyment. They are both series based on intelligence, risk and reward. 
Both geniuses ..but....Kaiji is to much dramatic and in one episode they barely advanced, and Kaiji its ""zawa zawa"" -and poor animation.no action at all, but when its geniuses- its geniuses.(oh.. and its more likely for kids, but if you want geniuses give its a chance -10 eps) 
Assuming you're not completely new to the industry or that you are not turned off by different art styles than these can very well feed your hunger for intense suspense anime which, for me, are hard to come by.They are both examples of mind games done right (for the most part at least...) with thought provoking and addicting narrative.Death note has its mystery and suspense coming from planned out strategies from both our protagonist and its rival with results taking some time to show which makes you want to see how the conflict will progress and who will outsmart the other. A game of morals, intelligence and political and moral ideals between 2 characters.Kaiji focuses almost exclusively on, well, Kaiji and how he manages to elaborate a way out of the most hopeless situations. Instead of one rival the obstacles come from games he is thrown into, The pressure and danger is more evident in this series with its numerous psychological setups usually forcing Kaiji to think outside the box and fight his own fear, lack of luck and despair. It feels more human, lacks the supernatural aspect Death Note has and goes further in terms of visual metaphors.Death note makes use of Light's thoughts to help both the suspense and the understanding of certain scenes while Kaiji relies on a narrator for pretty much the same purpose. Being death note more about Light's strategies against its rival and because with Kaiji it feels like you're watching (or participating on) a collection of deathly games I found both to be very fitting for the role they played.Death note has very little fan service and Kaiji has absolutely zero. read more 
These shows remind me of each other because they both contain a lot of mind games and suspense. A lot of high risk situations that can get your blood pumping, because one wrong move can ultimately destroy the MC. If you liked one of these shows for the psychological mind battles that happen between characters, then you'll definitely like the other 
Both of these animes are purely psychological. They revolve around the main character coming into contact with someone who opposes him, and the two having a seriously intense battles that consist of one person thinking ""I'm thinking this and there's no way my enemy will know"" and then the other person thinking ""Ah, I know he's thinking this, but there's no way he'll know I'm thinking this so I'll ruin his plans and do this"" AND THEN THE OTHER PERSON THINKING ""HA! Of course I knew you knew what I was thinking! Which is why I purposely did this in order to make you do this so I can win!!"" and it just goes on for a very long time, to be honest. But both are great!! read more 
Both anime are very heavy on the thrills and the dark, psychological atmosphere, Kaiji even more so than Death Note, and both anime have an emphasis on the strategy involved in the scenarios they present, with the main character having to devise creative plans to survive, and both anime allow the viewer to think about the scenarios along with the main character. Both anime are extremely fast-paced and addicting, and both feature peripheral, but still decently well-done thematic explorations, with Death Note delving into things like overly simplistic morality, and Kaiji emphasizing on themes relating to status and wealth, and demonstrating what people will do survive. read more 
Both contain geniuses that use intellect and mind to beat their opponents. Both want to keep you guessing. 
If you love anime with so much smartness and Characters pulls your attention to the max, Story hold much Not like any kind  that highlight on the society we live in and talk about the inside of everyone our dreams fears and our frustration and the pursuit of happiness, Message to everyone and a reminder. 
Both are Madhouse shows with a similar dark artstyle, which are about a highly intelligent protagonist and his plans to survive, using his intellect. The pacing is similar and makes both anime highly addicting. 
In terms of mind games, this one takes the cake. Just as the main protagonist in Death Note is trying to outsmart other characters with various orthodox or unorthodox strategies, Kaiji tries to think outside the box to survive and beat the gambling system and the heartless people in it. 
Kaiji has brilliant mind games as good as death note not to mention both death note and kaiji are made by same studio . Kaiji is about gambling and have amazing tension and soundtrack ZAWA ZAWA ZAWA ZAWA ZA-WA. 
In both series the main protagonist are confronted with antagonists that try to outwit them through a series of psychological battles. As there are two parties trying to outwit each other it makes both series unpredictable as the audience is constantly questioning who will be outfoxed. If you believe that Kaiji will not interest you as it lacks the supernatural elements that made Death Note intrinsically interesting you may be surprised. Even if you are not interested in gambling Kaiji's struggle to overcome more experienced gamblers through interpreting the situation and forming a simple but unique plan is reminiscent of the plans that Light Yagami formed in his attempt to learn L's identity. read more 
Both have a genius character (that isn't overpowered at all) playing mind games with people on their's intelligent level. The MC needs to stay ahead by a several steps in order to survive. Both have brilliant and tension story that will have you on the edge of your chair. 
a lot of thinking, outsmarting and predicting your opponent. Very intense and keeps you watching because you just have to see what happens.  
Both are very intense non-battle battle anime 
Both psychological thriller anime where main character is constantly at risk of failure. 
They aren't really similar. Gyakkyou Burai Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor isn't detective and main hero hasn't superpower (or super-object). But Kaiji is really wonderful thriller as Death Note, the only thing that maybe could you stop is animation, because it was made as old style. BUT it is made qualitatively. So if you aren't dependent of so sort animation and you like thrillers, this anime is for you.P.S. I would recommend to watch with subs. 
Both series are about outwitting your opponent by understanding their psychology while giving a fake sense of one's own psych 
In both animes opponents are trying to outsmart each other, you can find there lot of psychological mind games and complicated strategies 
Both are amazing thrillers (considering the first half of Death Note). The stories themselves are really different, so if you liked Death Note pretty much only because of the story and characters, i dont't know if you will like Kaiji that much. Now, if you liked Death Note because of the direction of the show, Kaiji may be a nice choice, as its direction is amazing, it builds up a lot of tension using audiovisual techniques and makes you always want to see the next episode, its overall a great thriller. "
3002,5040,24,"Pretty much the same aura around both of these animes.  OneOuts is about baseball gambling with alot of money on the line.  Both of them use there wits to outsmart the opponent but there is always someone with money they can try to scam... 
Same director, Same kind of psychological Seinen. Both anime are similar in a lot of way. While One outs is about baseball, what really stand out is the way he outsmart his oppenents. If you liked Kaiji, then you will most likely like One Outs. 
Both anime revolve around gambling and psychology. Both of these anime have amazing cliffhangers. 
Kaiji and One Outs focus around gambling, with a very similar presentation style and analysis. Overall, very interesting psychoanalytically and just in terms of suspense. 
Two stories where the logic is applied in different situations.Very good, either. It's worth watching. 
*Both are seinen and about games.*There's money in it.*Both psychology, strategy.*Intelligent protagonists.One Outs about baseball and Kaiji a thriller about survive but they have much in common. 
Both anime series involves the same director: Yuzo Sato. In fact, the main protagonist from both series has the same voice actor. Both series' main male protagonist has an intellectual mind and is not afraid of taking risks. Both series has a theme of gambling (with game elements)  involving psychological factors with suspense and intensity. Both series also has similar artwork as well as the way they are presented involving money. 
Both series feature intense gambling and mind-games, that will keep you on the edge of your seat.   
Kaiji and One-Outs are both similar in animation, due to both being done by Madhouse, as well as their basic concepts. Kaiji uses normal gambling and uses that as a base for psychological games, while on the other hand One Outs uses Baseball as a base for gambling which leads to psychological games. 
Both shows have a similar vibe to them, as they both are about gambling. They follow a main character that often finds himself in difficult situations, which he must solve using his own ingenuity. They have similar battles of wits and create an overall similar mood. They also have the same director. 
Although One Outs is less intense and thrilling and significantly less brutal, both animes are quite similar in the sense that they feature protagonists that use gambles and play with the minds of others to accomplish their goals. Both feature a rich, evil and unlikable antagonist who tries to mess with the protagonist.A difference though is that Kaiji is a lot less levelheaded and ""overpowered"" than Tokuchi but both are geniuses in their own respective way and come up with incredible solutions to the problems they face. If you're trying to find an anime as thrilling as GB Kaiji, One Outs may not be your best bet as has a much calmer atmosphere but if you liked Kaiji for the mindgames and outwits, you should definetly give One Outs a try!Also, both have the same voice actor which has a fitting voice for those roles. read more 
-Both are focalised in games-Both are using the psycological aspect of their games-Both have incredibly good and intelligents Main Characters-Both are going to show you how much No Game No Life is shitty 
High risk gambling by an intelligent MC. Stakes increase as the show progresses. Thriller with mind games. 
The main characters are quite the opposite to be honest . One is like a god in his show and the other in Kaiji is more human. They are all great gambling anime though with different styles 
Clearly the sports genre is merely of minor importance in One Outs. Primarily, the show's focus lies on mindgames that go on during a game. Both series feature gambling protagonists who aren't afraid to take risks when it comes to achieving their goals. While Kaiji puts the stakes higher with the MC regularly putting his life on the line, One Outs offers the same tension on the baseball ground.There's also the fact that both shows share a lot of the staff working on them. 
The central theme of both involves gambling high stakes where the protagonist makes use of psychology to outwit and overpower their opponents. One Outs differs being centered around baseball with a genius protagonist, while Kaiji is more brutal with its average protagonist and multiple different gambles. So, if your a fan of psychological anime that make use of strategy and showcase the risk revolved around gambling, then you will love both series. 
Easily the second best gambling anime, Kanji: Ultimate Survivor being the first, One Outs functions as a great alternate approach to the subgenre using a sport as a backdrop for truly intense gambling and action that just keep you on the edge. While not quite as excellent as Kaiji, it is still really truly great.  
The main character mainly uses his brain to win 
Both writers are marvelous in term of psychology and thriller..Both have a great storyBoth have little/no fan servicesBoth have marvelous quotes Both have extra manga content which wasn't adapted into animeBoth are worthy watching 
Both anime are about high stakes gambling and mind games, one is centred around sport, the other is about regular gambling (ie games like Rock Paper Scissors)Another thing they have in common is that they are incomplete :((((( 
Both stories strongly focus on the protagonist and pretty much only them, they want to win and money. They gable and use tricks to outsmart their opponents. 
Both shows center around gambling. There is a higher corporate power that influences the main character's struggles. Strategy is a major factor in the games. 
-Both have to do gambling-Both have the main character out-thinking his enemies(Plus a little luck)-Both are great shows that need more love 
They both involve gambling with a great main characterBoth characters solve their dilemmas in interesting ways that provide much entertainment. "
3002,19,5,"Both series put their main characters in psychologically distressing situations, and both of them are about their characters rising above the challenges and owning their fates. Plus, lots of man tears... 
Both are psychological thrillers animated by Madhouse about a man fighting for his values in an evil, corrupt world. 
In essence, both series features psychological themes involving the main protagonist in a world of twisted aberrations. It is a cruel world in both series and the main protagonist must play his cards right to make the most out of his life.Both has thriller like endings in many episodes.Madhouse is also involved with both series. 
This comparison might seem a bit weird to some people, but both anime have to do with the quality of the human soul. The decisions the two protagonists have to take are of the same nature: give in to the monster, or hold on to humanity, even if you might gain nothing in return? The feeling each anime gives is not quite that similar, but the message both shows are trying to get through is the same. I believe if one enjoyed either of these two, they will definitely enjoy the other. 
good show that shows the mc get his life upside down or ruined and they work the hardest to turn everything back to normal. "
3002,6114,5,"Both shows have the same kinda calm animation.Also the fact that a lot of the characters go through tough, sometimes life or death situations that show the true colors of who they are, whether they be good or bad.Also... MANLY TEARS!!!!!!!!!!! 
Both anime have the ""scum of society"" as their protagonists. Both deal with the cruelty of those in higher position. Both anime contain a high amount of tears. Both anime feature the value of trust in your comrades, although Rainbow is much more idealistic about it.Their premise is different, but the two shows are thematically very similar. 
Do you like anime with very realistic design / story and character? Do you want to watch a true seinen with true social issues ? Do you want a story so sad and tearing that you will weep like a baby ? So watch both, there are amazing shows for these, even if they sensibly not develop same universe type (Kaiji evolved in a gambling / money world while guys of Rainbow are in jail) but are related with thematics.  
Both series share a similar art style in the sense that everything looks sturdy and heavily outlined, and both are sausage fests with casts mostly made up of male characters. Both series make you root for the protagonists as they are thrown into despair and struggle through impossible situations, with the high points of each show feeling exhilarating, and the lows feeling like bottomless pits. I think both Kaiji and Rainbow share the same feeling of tension and high stakes which is why I recommend them. 
Both stories follow a group of characters trying to get out of miserable/desperate situations. The primary antagonists of the series are very similar in terms of their sadistic nature. Throughout the series, the protagonists are seemingly offered ways out of their dire circumstances by the antagonists, but those chances are often intended to merely provide false hope to the protagonists. Both series have a very ""hard-boiled""/""bad-ass"" vibe to them. Both were produced by Madhouse in the late 2000s and have fairly similar animation styles.   "
3002,263,4,"Tense as hell, adrenaline-pumping,  and manly tears-inducing.People pitted against each other. Same studio.Everything else is pretty much different - Kaiji is psychological and Ippo is raw power - but you should give the other a try if you're looking for something addicting. 
Both of these shows are over the top, intense shows about overcoming odds and facing adversity. While Kaiji does take a more calculated route than Ippo who often just gets into his zone, they both are giving it their all in high-stakes situations that last a long span of episodes.Both also make me want to scream a whole bunch because of how insanely tense everything is. 
Kaiji and Ippo are two very different shows, but are similar in a few important ways.-The soundtracks for both shows are phenomenal (Hideki Taniuchi worked on the soundtrack for Kaiji and the opening songs for Ippo)-Both shows show the psychological parts of their respective genres, boxing and extreme gambling. Kaiji and Ippo both overcome challenges through past experiences and their knowledge.-Both shows have unique art styles and are produced by the same studio.-Both shows are guaranteed to keep you at the edge of your seat despite their differences 
Both are extremely exciting shows with expressive artstyles and many emotional ""working through pain"" moments. They also feature strong psychological elements and very over the top visual metaphors for their otherwise mundane ""battles"". "

185,263,6,"Similar art style, both about sports, although one is boxing the other is street racing.  Follows the story of shy underachiever, with a unexpected talent for their sport.  Both have romantic side plots and sprinkles of comedy. 
Initial D and Hajime no Ippo explore a competitive atmosphere filled with rivalries, intensity, and respect. Both series explore characters in a concrete way. The main character is an underdog that gets himself involved with powerful adversaries that bring out his natural abilities to test. The two series may appeal to different sports, but they retain the competitive style related to their activities.Plot-wise, both series are easy to follow and involve some strategy. At the same time, within these plots, there are character developments, dynamics, and relationships that are explored in a realistic format. 
Similar in concepts. Both are about sporting and rising to the top against all odds. Hajime No Ippo focuses on Boxing and Initial D on racing. Both involved highly intense action sequences which will get your blood pumping and have you riding on the edge of your seats.Both Ippo and Takumi are similar in personalities and their rise to the top both involved training and spirit. Initial D is not something to be missed.  
Although one is about street racing and the other about boxing, these two pretty much have the same ""aura"" around them. Both protagonists develop a talent for a certain sport through their daily job. Without any intention of being a pro, they end up climbing up the ladder, battling different opponents and ending up loving the sport. Besides that, there's also small details: both Ippo and Takumi only have one parent, both end up falling in love and have flash backs of violence. Also, the great use of music and the intensity is about the same. If you couldn't stop watching Hajime No Ippo, you'll possibly be just as glued to Initial D. read more 
Both shows share a really similar artstyle, which isn't a surprise, since Hajime no Ippo's author is Initial D's author's student. Both shows revolve around incredibly and I mean INCREDIBLY dangerous sports, due to the severe danger the intensity whenever there's action is immense. Chills each time. In both shows the main character has their own romance-life with a decent amount of screentime, having their girlfriend relentlessly worry due to their dangerous sport. 
While the themes are very different, both shows have the exact same atmosphere.Both have an enemy of the week formula and with their over-the-top style it's super entertaining.The protagonists are also similar in a sense. Both are underdogs at the start and become legends after numerous battles. "

Initial D is a bit older but it still has its charm in terms of exciting showdowns, great music during the suspenseful moments, and love interests. It's also nice that both are long series so you can watch as much as you want, and they both have satisfying endings.A major difference, besides the sport - Major is baseball, and Initial D is street racing, is the personality of the MCs. Goro is hot-headed and passionate whereas Takumi is more cool-headed and calm, sometimes even aloof or just spaced out. However, you'll find out that both hate to lose, and both constantly surprise their opponents and make friends/supporters who have high expectations. Will not disappoint. read more "

I was reluctant at first, because personally I find volleyball boring. Yeah, it's about volleyball. But Haikyuu at the moment shows a great potential and one  of my favorite animes of this season. They both have similar plots. The main characters (In KnB Kuroko, in Haikyuu Shouyou) both are underestimated and seem like they are completely wasteful to have on a team. Both of them are short and seem weak, but inside they have an overwhelming power dwelling within them that brings their team forward. The two have a pair who are aiming to be the aces and are 1st years. The duo are dominant and work together to take down the opponent.

Kuroko no Basket's similar to Slam Dunk as because the anime both shows a competition or tournament within the region. The only difference of this shows is that; Slam Dunk is more on reality, while Kuroko no Basket is not realistic, the anime shows some weird basketball technique's which is impossible for people to do unlike Slam Dunk. Another thing why I should recommend Slam Dunk is that also has a great art, great story and great soundtracks. 
Both series are very similar :- both are sports genre, specificately both are about basketball- both have great art- both have great OST- both have great characters etc...If you liked one of them you would like the other for sure !! "
18115,5114,4,"Magi is like a combination of One Piece and FMA, it takes the best of those two and it's a really great shounen. You have to watch the prequel named Labyrinth of Magic first.FMA shares some rather dark themes with Magi, political and socials. 
The best way to put this (without giving anything away) is that magi is the spiritual successor to FMA Brotherhood. Really similar vibe as neither is a typical shounen anime. 
The main characters are very endearing, they have their own personality and are not very similar to those in FMAB. However, the main story are likely, especially the end.It's two world of ""magic"", but in a different kind. FMAB is more based on, close to science where as Magi is more a fantasy world, which reminds me a little of Harry Potter, because we're discovering it at the same time as the characters.To my mind, it's very psychological, there's a lot of moral, friendship and a main goal. There is a lot excellent fight too, very well presented, and it's also pretty fun too.The two anime is very likely but also different, because of theirs large topics which each of anime is focused on.In to my opinion, i have not any preference between this two, because even if the story is kind of similar, the main emotion which we can feel is a little different.I felt more pain, struggle, strong feeling in FMAB in every single episode where as in Magi, it was more hope, joy, a little fear and a lot of compassion but in the whole anime.But if I had to choose one of them, i'd probably chose FMAB because it's maybe more dynamic for me, intense emotionally. read more

I'm a big fan of both shows and I can tell how much they are familiar! The fighting styles are fairly similar to Magi, including the settings of the story and pretty much the artstyles as you can trust MadHouse. Though Magic is not included ((cough Hisoka cough)) in the HxH series, they are both very popular Shounen series. Both shows does also focus on side character's stories as it makes the show more intense and relaxing to watch. read more 
Both of these anime feature a charismatic and friendly protagonist who is oblivious to the malice of the world. Both of these protagonists (Aladdin in Magi and Gon in HxH) are incredibly forgiving of the transgressions of their enemies and they see the horrible world that both of them reside in through very bright lenses. They can't (or maybe don't want to) see the darkness present within others. Both of these anime involve the main characters embarking on a journey or adventure of one sort or another and both contain plenty of high-octane fights with aesthetically pleasing visuals and cool power systems. Djinn Equips(Magi) make up for their lack of creative use and specialization with sheer flair and flamboyance.  Both anime contain themes of vengeance and whether or not vengeance is truly right. There are plenty of other things, however, saying more will ultimately spoil things for you. If you liked one, you'll probably like the other. read more "
11843,10165,57,"Both are slice-of-life anime dealing with the everyday high school lives of boys/girls. Both can be rather hit or miss in the comedy department, though Nichijou tends to takes its jokes to whole new extremes. 
Slife-of-life series that set themselves apart from the rest with their ridiculous humour and random high-tension moments. They call themselves 'everyday' series, and sure enough, even their absolute weirdest moments can be strangely relatable. 
Despite the fact that Nichijou focuses on the daily lives of high school girls, and Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou focuses on the daily lives of high school boys, there are three elements that shine very brightly and show a certain correlation in both series. The first is the underlying concept: these shows tackle some of the common aspects of being a high school girl or boy, respective to the title, as well as some of the stranger aspects of it. Second is the execution of this idea. Both are comedies, and, therefore, exaggerate certain scenarios, but both do so in a similar manner, and typically through the eyes of a growing set of cast members, while still remaining  primarily focused on three main characters (well, I suppose you could say five or six, in Nichijou’s case). The responses to these absurd scenarios are typically outrageous, but always unique to the individual character who experiences or responds to it. Thirdly, the art style of both are different from each other, but, at the same time, very distinct and set apart from the art from other titles, and the music is very unique and catchy.Both of these anime are set apart from other comedy-based anime due to their unique execution and strangely engaging, yet distant cast. If one of the two manages to capture your attention, the other is likely to do the same. read more 
Daily life of high school students with a lot of comedy, and both is so RANDOM! 
Both series' episodes contain a few sketches which rarely correspond to other and they have similar humor style. 
Both  are school comedies with the same type of random humor. One is just mainly about girls, and the other one is mainly about boys. 
The female version of Danshi No Nichijou is ""Nichijou"" itself. While the comedy of the male version is a bit funky and teen-oriented, Nichijou offers a comedy that fits all the ages. Yet, the comedy seen in both of anime is actually enjoyable to anyone who wants to break free from boredom. 
Even the title is similar. DKNN presents the daily life of high school boys. Nichijou does the same, but with girls. Both series are very funny, have the same sense of humor and hilarious/wierd characters. Yukko is a little bit similar to Tadakuni IMO. And Mio reminds me of Hidenori and Yoshitake. I think that every Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou fan should try Nichijou. It's worth it. 
Very similar comedy styles. Both set in a ""normal"" slice-of-life school setting, with random cutscenes of hilariousness. The only difference is Nichijou treats truly impossible events (robots, cats talking, etc.) as completely average. Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou focuses more on regular high school boys.  
A series of comedic sketches from everyday life of a group of high-schoolers without any big plot. 
A story about their everyday life, the random things they do. They are really similar to each other only except that Nichijou has female main characters. 
Both series adapt a slice of life approach with exaggerated scenes of humor, comedy, and absurd dialogues. In fact, some of the moments in both series are so random that it almost makes little to no sense.Both series take place at a high school life setting where there is drama involving the main characters. Both series also feature main cute scenes and just in general, nonsense revolving around the characters' lives. 
A group of three school friends with varied personalities involve others in their weird, but entertaining lives.  
Well, the name says almost everything, is about the daily lives of the characters. Both anime have random sense comedy so, for those who like comedy, this is it. 
Those two animes are so similar, it's about school-comedy life, where all the characters face funny situations that leaves them in a weird position, and many supernatural accidents happen in both of these anime series. 
Both are very funny except for nichijou,the comedy began o shallow but fun to watch 
If you liked Nichijou, then you'll love Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou. The two share a style of doing skits and random humor. The characters are quite enjoyable and the skits are unique. Although Nichijou is a bit more clean when it comes to the humor. Both still have got me laughing until I cried. 
You will smile with this anime a lot. The jokes are very good and it's very original. I love this anime too, I smiled and enjoyed a lot with this anime. For me, is the best anime of comedy. I really recommend it. 
Danshi and nichijou are both slice of life/comedy/randomness anime. They are really funny and interesting, but i think danshi is a bit funnier than nichijou. These shows don't have a story, so don't watch them if you expect story, these are just a bunch of random and hilarious jokes. While in danshi mc are male, in nichijou mc are female. 
Both of them are Slice of Life series about highschool girls and boys. They've got similar humour and jokes as well as funny characters. I guarantee you that you won't stop laughing when watching both of them. 
Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou = ""Daily Lives of High School Boys"". Nichijou = ""My Ordinary Life""; See the resemblances already? Both anime take place primarily in a high school setting with a colorful, dank cast of characters with dank humor. Skits are taken to a whole new level of extremes and even the most ordinary of situations become something extraordinary.  
Both are aboout funny everyday situations gone awkward and hilarious 
Both shows take place in high school and the episodes are made in the same way with different skits. They both mainly follow three friends but have a lot of side characters as well. If you liked the comedy of one then you'll surely like the other. 
both of them have a mild comedy-life story, but sometimes excessivethey also have a little weird characterthis anime are comfortable to watch when you've spare time 
Nichijou was about similar to Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou.. In Nichijou, the story goes with female casts and some male supporting.. But in Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou, it was backward.. The story was casted by male actors and some female actors supporting the story.. Funny and laugh was the similarity of these anime series.. 
If you watched Nichijou I highly recommend to watch this too. Well if you already watched and loved Nichijou watching another ""Everyday life"" anime wouldn't hurt. The Comedy is on equal or IMO slightly better than Nichijou's. Also you don't need to remember the character's names to have fun (as stated in the anime) :D 
Both are stories of ""daily life of some students"", but more comical and exaggerated form, and also use mini-histories. The protagonists are the same gender in majority. 
Both series follow a school of weirdos doing silly things in very short skits. 
these are both slice of life comedies. Both are very funny and deliver the comedy in a similar fashion 
Both have exactly the same format of endless comedic skits. As such there is no overall story but some skits do link together over time.Each has a wide cast of characters that appear during scenes.Both are much funnier than the average comedy.Nichijou focuses on the lives of 3 highschool girls while Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou focuses on the lives of 3 highschool boys. 
It Nichijou male version 
Both are hilarious, random, super funny and both shows are about teens and they daily lives C: 
Nichijou depicts the daily lives of three high school girls. But in Danishi Koukousei no Nichijou it's rather the opposite. 3 highschool boys will be living their daily lives. Both shows doesn't have a main story rather tells seperate story. 
-Both anime tell about everyday life (especially students) with many hillarious comedy.-Both anime's episode consist of some parts that actually unrelated with each other. 
Pretty much both of them are Comedy/Slice of life anime with lots of random jokes implemented in them. They also dont have a specific plot in which the story follows. However, Nichijou may have extreme events such as a talking cat, your school director fighting with a deer and even ""destroying planets with laser beams "" while DKNN shows the life of Highschool boys and their ""boring"" lives.Nichijou shows all the characters and their traits while DKNN mostly shows ""boys"" acting like ""boys"".If you are a fan of Slice of life/Comedy anime, you should definitely try them out! 
If you liked the high school comedy aspect of Nichijou then you might like this, though one thing to note is that is anime is more of a crude type of comedy in contrast to the pure-hearted comedy and slice of life aspect of Nichijou. 
Similar sketch comedy. 
Nichijou but it's boys instead of girls 
Instead of funny show with female main cast in highschool you have a funny show with male main cast in highschool. :D 
Both are focused in life of students. The comedy ae alike and the art style are almost similar to each other 
Similar ComedySchool SettingHilarious 
Pretty much the same but with girls instead of boys. Both hilarious! 
Hilarious, disjointed and sometimes nonsensical, both shows are a carefree laughing spree in the context of everyday life. 
They both are slice-of-life high school gag anime with a tremendous amount of humor. They are more or less the same thing except the MCs are guys in Danshi and girls in Nichijou. Both devotes a fair amout of screen time to side characters and subgroups. 
Both are very bizarre in their way of comedy, although Nichijou excels in it, Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou is not far behind. Both are very enjoyable, and if you loved Nichijou, you will love Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou too. 
both had slice of life , highschool background , had a great comedy but nichijou was more extreme... 
Similar short funny moments compiled on one episode. Both are one of the best comedy ever existed in anime industry 
Both shows focus on daily lives of students, with both following similar episodic formats. They also both have a very chaotic style of humour  
Silliness and over-the-top humor. If you're looking for a good laugh, both of these series could satisfy you. 
A group of three friends go about their normal school lives, in an episodic, hilarious take on teenage years.  
Very similar in comedic style, with pretty much the same sketch format that makes both shows unique. Highly rewatchable, too. 
Same concept of mundane daily highschool life made funny by witty humor. Very similar to Nichijou in setting/characters (both have 3 highschool friends, except Nichijou is of course girls and Danshi Koukoussi no Nichijou is the exact opposite.)Although, DKnN isn’t as over the top at Nichijou by any means. 
Comedies with high school studens. Both contains short sketches. 
Slice of life comedies divided in segments, each focusing on a different group of mostly high school students. The humor often feels similar, with a lot of absurd jokes combined with exaggerated faces and reactions. 
Totally recommended, just like you and everyone, we went through High school and spent our time and happiness by the amazing people we met. 
-Both will make you laugh a lot.... Almost guaranteed xD-Both have their fair share of goofy and hilarious characters-Must-watch titles for comedy lovers :D 
These two have exactly the same kind of humor and episode structure (with running gags, recurring characters, etc.). The only difference is that Nichijou is mainly about high school girls, but Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou is abut high school boys. If you enjoyed one of these you will love the other one too. "
11843,918,42,"Exactly the same kind of humour, but different setting. 
Kimi to boku meets Gintama.boys doing random funny stuff in high school setting.it is from Sunrise like Gintama and shares many staff with it like Takamatsu, Shinji as director,Audio Highs for music and Sugita, Tomokazu and Suzumura, Kenichi as Voice Actors 
Other than the fact that one of the main character is voiced by same voice actor as Gintoki, this anime really does remind me of Gintama, but in an entirely different and refreshing set up. It was also very unique for me in terms of its take on high school girls, most anime I see show high school girls as timid and powerless or outright evil. The comedy is outstanding, there's never a dull moment. Don't give it much thought, just go for it. This series won't disappoint.  
Daily life, crazy characters, a lot of comedy, randomness. 
DanKou and Gintama share some of the aspects as the comedy anime. Although Gintama (and it's sequel) are superbly funny, DanKou's Situational Comedy was similar to Gintama. You got the same director, same music composer, same producer for this anime and the same seiyuus from the epic anime series.  
They nearly have the same comedy sense, it doesn't have any arcs but its hilarious to the core. If you liked Gintama's way of comedy and the way that girl's are stronger than guys, go ahead and watch Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou!  
Jokes' topics, episodic style and pure randomness make Daily Lives of High School Boys and Gintama quite alike in terms of comedy. As for die-hard Gintama fans, these animes not only share Sugita Tomokazu and Suzumura Kenichi, but also voice actors of Sa-chan, Zura, Kijima Matako and even the frigging Shogun! You'll definitely have some fun figuring them out. 
The same sense of humor. Some scenes are totally random, characters have epic inner thoughts about ordinary things and sometimes have the same way of speaking. Both series are very funny and make you laugh out loud. Also you can hear a few seiyuus from both of these series. Hidenori is voiced by Sugita Tomokazu - the same goes for Gintama's main character - Gintoki. There's Suzumura Kenichi (DKNN - Yoshitake, Gintama - Okita), Ishida Akira (DKNN - President, Gintama - Katsura) and Kobayashi Yuu (DKNN - Yanagi, Gintama - Sacchan).And both are made by Sunrise. It explains everything. 
Studio Sunrise animated both of them.Shinji Tkamatsu directed both of them.Tomokazu Sugito voiced Gintoki from Gintama and Hidenori from DKnN.Audio Highs composed music for both shows.Also, same comedy style: mocking everything around them!Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou is Gintama in High school setting. 
The style of parody is really similar to Gintama, not to mention same seiyuu on one of the characters.Both involve a trio and there is no real story to it, but both are really enjoyable comedies all the way through. 
Similar jokes, similar mood, similar directing style. Daily Lives of High School Boys feels like a real-world, modern day version of what Gintama would be if the characters were all in high school (minus the more battle shounen-esque sections). If you watched Gintama and want more of that style of humor, this is a great place to find it. If you watched Daily Lives and want something similar but with more substance, Gintama is the place to go. 
Danshi Koukousei and Gintama are two rare shows in anime industry that make use of situational irony as its main source of entertainment, though Gintama also heavily lean on parody of practically everything. Both shows are mainly episodic, showcasing the main characters' daily lives.  
Made my the same studio and has similar comedy. Both are hilarious! Both have the same delivery of jokes and comedic behavior. If you enjoyed or loved either of these you'll enjoy the other as well. 
Guaranteed to make you laugh each episode. Have a bunch idiot, crazy people that sometime make the ""tsukkomi"" (straight man) stressed. Both main ""boke"" (funny person) voiced by an awesome seiyuu Sugita-san, make it even cooler. The difference is that Gintama sets in ancient Japan, danshi koukousei now. Also Gintama has more development of plot. If you love comedy, you should watch both of them. 
These two series have the same kind of comedy and absurd situations, maybe because they have the same director and Sugita Tomokazu in the lead role (Gintoki/Hidenori).Both are mainly plotless but have some long-lasting stories.Their music (same composer) has also the same perfect way to accompagny the comedy. 
Gag humour that picks up after a while, if you enjoyed Danshi in that manner you will probably enjoy Gintama and get more. 
Both are very funny and relaxing.Differences:Gintama - Is longer and therefore has more deep storyDanshi Koukousei no Nichijou - doesn't have a real plotOverall, they are both great anime and worth your time unless you dislike comedy. 
The style of comedy is the same although different setting. Hilarious anime that will you in tears of laughter.  
JUST DO IT.Everything in Gintama except well its fans and 200+ episodes is in Danshikou. They both have Sugita-san in it, above all else, sexual jokes and some touching or laughable or touching/laughing moments.DO IT. 
My favourite comedy series, altough different in settings (Gintama is set in the Edo period with a twist and Danshi is set in highschool) the story follow tree main chars and their daily lives but here is where the fun begins, every little thing becomes the biggest thing in the universe, every normal scene turns into something comical and everyone is anything but ""normal"".Both share a couple of voice actors (Tomozaku Sugita as Gintoki and Hidenori, Suzumura Kenichi as Sougo and Yoshitake etc), both made by Sunrise.Having a bad day? Start watching this, the bad day will turn into the best day eva. 
Both are freaking awesome :PPlus have the same sense of humour. 
Both shows have similar humor. If you liked one you'll like the other. The director if I am not mistaken is the same as in some episodes of gintama and the voice actor of Hidenori is the same of Sakata Gintoki.  
Same style of comedy, has references to different animes. Both will have you laughing a lot.Gintama is set in a world of samurai and aliensDanshi Koukousei is a school type setting 
Aside from sharing main characters with the same voice actor, you'll find that the humor is very similar in both shows. 
These are one of the funniest show ever made. Gintoki truly reminds me of the cast of DKnN. Laid-back, catches up to the mistake of everyone and makes a joke about it. With the absurdity in this anime i doubt you'll survive. Good luck! 
Both animes have the same type of humor. They are both extremely hilarious with never-ending jokes. Gintama : Gintama is about a former Samurai trying to make a living while being a Jack of All Trades. He befriends two people, Kagura and Shinpachi, and they decide to stay and work with him in the odd jobs they are given.Danshi Koukousei no nichijou (Daily lives of high school boys) : Is simply as the title says. Three friends, high school boys, go through their normal, joke filled days in high school. Wondering what normal boys wonder such as things about girls, food, etc. In these two animes, you will never be bored. Every episode is packed with hilariousness. The main character in Gintama has the same voice actor as the main character in Danshi as well. These two animes are not ones to be missed, they are extremely hilarious. read more 
Well, besides the fact that one of the mc has the same VA as Gintoki, both are pretty funny and has similar kind of humour. The only major difference is the setting. If you really enjoy Gintama, you should enjoy this too. 
Well both of these anime's are made by the same studio, but that's not all infact both of these anime's are almost exactly the same. Daily Lives Of Highschool boys is the same as GIntama in just different settings. Gintama and Daily Lives Of Highschool Boys are definitely in top some of the most hilarious anime's i've watched. Both of the series uses almost exactly the same voice actors which just adds to the similar feeling. At the start of Daily Lives Of Highschool Boys i started to believe it was just a parody of Gintama. These two anime's are by far the most similar anime's i've ever watched. read more 
Both have the same kind of comedy, they both have random daily lives. 
Both are comedy show sharing pretty much the same humour. 
Both are amazing comedies, with our favorite voice actor: Tomokazu Sugita, playing one of the main characters. 
Both are ridiculously hilarious!! Every episode leaves you smiling or even laughing like crazy. Also the VA of Gintoki also voices one of the main characters in Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou. 
Like Gintama, this is a comedy surrounding a group of people and the shows have both like to break the 4th wall. They both (mostly) have episodic humour based around what the characters do in their daily lives. It is directed by the previous director of Gintama and so Danshi Koukousei No Nichijou has a similar style of humour (toilet humour etc).  
It has Sakata Gintoki's Voice Actor, Tomokazu Sugita as one of the MC's. It may not have jokes about random-ass topics like Hemorrhoids which Gintama did but I guarantee you that the idiots in Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou will definitely make you wheeze. 
Both are comedy anime that are hilariously funny and absurd. The main characters even share the same VA(Gintoki and Hidenori.) And both anime are easy to understand and get into. 
the main characters in both series are trios, 2 fun characters: gintoki and hidenori ( both are voiced by sugita), kagura and yoshitake, and the straight normal dude who always gets laughed at or ignored: shinpachi and tadakuni, about comedy, you're going to notice similarities, both series make fun of of other anime and include tons of pop culture references ,sarcasm, satire, and some of the jokes are the same, not to mention both have a crazy cast of women, believe you don't want to mess with them, so basically if you liked gintama, you're going to love this one 
They are similar in terms of:-Gives you a good laugh-Characters are interesting and quirky-Art is nice-Have their own ideas of pranks 
Similarity-leading to unexpected humorous Difference-Gintama has a setting of a company that able to do anything that their customers ask.-Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou is high school setting  Which one is better?sly, you gonna love both of them! 
Both series share the same style of comedy and some voice actors. 
Similar genre,almost the same voice actors,stupid main characters,male characters get bullied by female charactersGintama is about a samurai named Sakata Gintoki and his day-to-day life doing various jobs with two teenagers.There's comedy...loads of it,and there are some tear jearkers and some really good action along the wayDanshi koukousei no nichijou focuses on a trio of teenage boys,their classmates and their various antics.Also it focuses on the Literature Girl who is by far the most hilarious character in this anime 
This show is a must watch if you have seen enough anime and read enough manga. Its humour is similar to highschool boys. 
Both are slice of life shows that make you laugh  "
11843,37105,10,"Grand Blue = Daily Lives of College Boys. Both are good for a laugh  
It's highschool comedy to the max, yo! Quite seriously those two take worn-out formula and for once make it unbelievably funny. 
Both series are directed by Takamatsu Shinji, and their comedic styles are similar. Just like the high school boys in ""Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou"", the college boys in ""Grand Blue"" are also silly guys and often make troubles. They have a strong desire to date pretty girls, but in most cases the dates will be destoryed by their buddies.If you like one of the two series, the other will certainly make you laugh. 
Both are great comedy titlesBoth contain school lifeBoth have amazing face designs (if you know what i mean)To me grand blue feels like a sequel to Danshi koukousei no nichijou because its like from daily lives of highschool boys grand blue becomes daily lives of collage boys 
If you loved Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou or even liked, I highly recommend you to watch Grand Blue.These animes have the same kind of humor and they will make WTF and unexpected moments like Gintama.Both mains characters of these animes will make silly faces along the episodes .Even if Grand Blue use multiples times the same kind of jokes (for example the naked guys at the ""Grand Blue Diving Shop"" or the main characters who drank an excessive amount of alcohol every time), it's always hilarious and I'm sure at like 99% that with Grand Blue (or Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou if you already watched Grand Blue lol) you will laugh out loud xD (And that's good for you because laughing is good for health xDDD) read more 
Both anime are fairly realistic without too many regular comedy tropes, personally I prefer Grand Blue over Daily Lives Of Highschool Boys because its more realistic for both highschool and college life. Also both anime have some seriously funny repeating jokes wich I usually dislike but for some reason the more they repeat the funnier they are in these series. Both anime evoke quite strong feelings of nostalgia and happiness in me, as they remind me of messing around and just living life with my friends, and if you also miss being out with your homies then I strongly suggest these anime. 
Comedy in both the series is great. I had a blast watching both of them. While Grand Blue has a proper story, High School Boy's Daily Lives has mini stories with followups. You will laugh alot while watching. So, just watch em and decie for yourself. :D 
This is just a comedy anime and just looks on to fun students have in their college life. 
It's simple, EPIC COMEDY for both shows and it's really enjoyable to watch!  
A but lacking in story and animation. Doesn't have a Main character but focused on everyone. But it's funny "
11843,9969,3,"DanKou and Gintama share comedic aspects; Gintama and its sequel are superbly funny and Dankou's situational comedy is similar to it. Both the first Gintama series and DanKou share the same director, music director, producer and a number of seiyuu. 
If you love Gintama but its a bit to long you should check nichijou, just like the name tell is about ""Daily lives of high school boys"".Story line is random as hell and very funny, the animation is in one word ""original"", the expressions and reactions will make you laugh ALOT.NOTE: theres also an anime with the name ""Nichijou"" not confuse them (also nice and similar but ""Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou"" is the one i recommend ) 
These two are one of the few anime series that are actually funny without forced humour.These series don't try too hard to be funny like a certain anime series do and end up being cringefests.If you really wanna experience humour in anime then you should watch these two.Gintama has that surreal humour and slapstick comedy with some good shonen fights that'll keep you hooked if you've had enough of the all the comedy.Daily Lives of Highschool Boys also  utilizes the slapstick comedy and also cringe-comedy.Just like Gintama it also breaks a lot of fourth-walls and destroys recurring anime cliches.It has the unique episode style of having little two-minute long episodes in one 24 minute episode.I highly recommend both series and I myself hold them in very high regard. read more "
11843,37999,2,"Similar, sketch-sequence dynamic across the episodes.  Very frantic and entertaining and even in a school setting.  Both a must watch. 
same day-by-day-, situation-by-situation type story telling, keep in mind though that Kaguya-sama is a romance, but it doesn't have that cheesy & slow build up that most romance shows do as its also a seinenthey both have the same type of meta humor that doesn't really rely or overplay on one single trope like most other comedy-centered anime do which is really nice "
627,5941,10,"Well both are about baseball and they have several other similarities; however, i don't want to give anything away so you'll just have to watch to find out!! ^_^ 
Both baseball animes in which the main characters are determined to advance in baseball because of some emotional event experienced in their lives.  
A similar event occurs early on in both shows. The male main characters are power pitchers. Both shows have a baseball loving female main character. 
Both about baseball, though Cross Game a little ""lighter"" and Major is more of a serious anime. Same kind of chars and similiar story 
Baseball, Romance, Tragedy, Friends, HardWork 
Both of them are similar because they both love baseball and improve. The main characters are alike. The anime shows little bit of romance, childhood, and both characters been through a death of someone they love and cared for. So if you love cross game then you will love major or if you love major then you will love cross game. 
They are both baseball animes. Without giving out spoilers, similar situations occur to them. This leads to the protagonist maturing through the sport. 
If you love a good story chronicling someones life through baseball, than you have to watch the king of them all, Cross Game 
People close to the Main Character die in both series, only that in Cross game, it's in episode 1, but it's still sad, considering how old they are, and their relationships.You get to follow the MC as they grow up, and there are some really emotional scenes, that involve the MC recalling memories of the important person's death throughout the show. Both about baseball, and rising to the top. 
Both amazing baseball storiesMC goes through heartbreak during the beginningBoth MCs are powerful pitchers that can throw up to around 97-99 MPH. "
627,263,3,"Enjoy watching people play a sport and get better and better at it? Hajime no Ippo and Major (all seasons) both give you exactly this.While Goro (Major) is more on the ""genius"" side, and Ippo is more on the ""hard working"" side, they both strive toward their goals with  extreme passion. If you enjoyed one, you'll definitely enjoy the other. 
If you enjoy sports anime, this will be a good watch. Similarly, both have characters ""grow"" throughout their careers and depicts their fight against stronger opponents and how they manage to overcome them.Major covers baseball, which has more aspects to work with as compared to boxing, due to teams being involved. This also means more characters to develop (although HnI does develop its other characters too) and a heavy focus on teamwork. 
A story about the pursuit of a dream, overcoming difficulties, preserving oneself. "
627,20583,3,"Major is a baseball anime and Haikyuu!! is about volleyball. In both series the main characters are aiming for and the passion they show is very addicting. 
If you liked haikyuu im sure youll really enjoy major. We see the main protagonist Goros entire life throughout the show. Along with the friends and rivalrys he has made along the way. This is my second favorite sports anime behind haikyuu  
both are really good sport animes Major is actually old anime so the animation is not in the same level as Haikyuu but it is worth to watch  "
1842,5941,2,"High schoolers trying to get to Koshien :) 
Cross Game and the 3rd season of Major are basically the same.They both involve an aspiring pitcher, and his goal to get to Koshien. The protagonists also went through a traumatic incident in their past. They both have female love interests that love to play baseball. Also I couldn't help but notice that they both have the same high school name ""Seishuu"". Sports anime is not a very popular genre, but I recommend that you should see Major S3 and Cross Game, because they are both suspenseful, romantic, and most importantly enjoyable.  "
1842,5040,1,Both characters strive to be the best pitcher in their league and one day win the world series. 
2966,6594,15,"They talk a lot and I mean A LOT in both. The chit-chat is funny, sometimes deep, and also very absorbing. Both have fantasy style setup. And of course brilliant couples :) 
There's something special about the way the two main characters grow with one another in both series that just makes you fall in love with them as a couple. So much character in each Anime's main cast too. The soundtracks are great and would be pretty entertaining to see them swapped with each other. If you want a good adventure, both of these shows are especially perfect for the craving. <3 I found both Spice and Wolf and Katanagatari left me with the same feeling of depression after I finished them too. haha 
The dialogues structure-script feel similar, as exposing facts or historical events. These are long and become tedious after a while, but there is always a catch phrase, a distintive action or a particular event in or related to the dialogue that keeps the viewer enjoying the conversation while it lasts. 
After reading 10 Spice and Wolf novels and watching the series multiple times, I believe Katanagatari to be the most similar show to Spice and Wolf even if the settings are different. They share the same aesthetic sensibilities of witty dialogue and presenting the viewer with a set of tools to solve a puzzling situation the characters get placed in. Spice and Wolf has playful banter between Holo and Lawrence and uses suspenseful economic struggles and trading dilemmas to force the viewer to also come up with a solution. Katanagatari matches the atmosphere with witty dialogue between its main characters and provides the same challenge to the viewer with battles instead of economics. Maoyu Mayuu Yusha is thought to be the closest recommendation for Spice and Wolf. But I would like to disagree on this account. The dynamic of the relationship is quite different; instead of two characters teasing each other and more subtle romantic goals, Maoyu Mayuu has two awkward characters that both seem like  high school students trying to flirt with each other and have overt romantic intent. It is not two people with different goals in mind that seemingly grow close after arguing, teasing, and laughing like inf Spice and Wolf. Instead, Maoyu presents a love at first site of two characters with the same goal but are awkwardly hesitant to advance the relationship. This show also presents economics but not in a riddling manner that requires thinking. Solutions are just flatly presented to problems whose context is not fully given. The viewer is not presented with a problem and given the ability or tools to reason a solution like in Spice and Wolf. Instead a solution just appears from the Crimson Scholar for a problem the viewer is not entirely aware even exists or to what degree. In essence, it is similar in a shallow manner that there are economics and somewhat romantic interpersonal relationships, but the dynamic of the relationship is vastly different and there is no well developed scenarios to challenge the viewer.  read more 
Both series deal with the relationship between two protagonists of the opposite sex who - more or less - meet by chance and join each other to go on an epic journey in a beautiful, somewhat medieval, fantasy setting. Their, kind of vague, purposes may differ (in Katanagatari it's some kind of treasure hunt, in Spice and Wolf it's the desire to explore the world) and while Katanagatari involves some politics and battles, whereas Spice and Wolf deals with trading and bargaining, both heavily rely on dialogues and the characters' interactions along the way, which have a lot in common as well. Both females, for instance, are cunning little creatures who not only like to tease their respective partner with cutting remarks, but also know how to manipulate the people around them, which often comes in handy for getting what they want.If you enjoyed the development of a mature romantic relationship during their journey through a fantastic world as well as the humorous dialogues, cunning and pure, and the overall well-rounded characters in one of these shows, chances are you'll enjoy the other. read more 
Katanagatari is spice and wolf - the hot wolf girl and + some actually quirky and interesting characters who most often have lots of witty banter and with some entertaining fight sequences too  
both are heavily focused on both MC's and their interactions with each other. the interactions are actually the best part, because they usually have full conversations and its nice seeing them interact and react.one is straightforward while the other is very mischievous. kinda like the whole manzai routine.both couples are travelingboth girls have mysterious pastsboth have nice ratings and are fairly popular 
Katanagatari and Spice and Wolf have similar pacing, and are both extremely dialogue-heavy, especially between the two main characters. Both have a fantasy-type setting, but Katanagatari also has some action scenes, while Spice and Wolf revolves around merchants and trading. If you enjoyed the character interaction between the characters of one of these shows, you will probably like the other as well.  
In a lot of ways, these two series reminds me of one and the other.Both series features a lot of interactions between the main male and female protagonist through their journey after their fated encounter. Speaking of which, these two series has an adventure like theme in a fantasy setting. Through their journey, they explore various places and learn new ideas as well as about one and the other.Both series' main female protagonist views herself as wise but at times becomes frustrated at various events especially regarding the main male protagonist with his actions. They also have mysterious pasts.Throughout the journey, the duo encounters other characters and conflicts but grows closer after each episode. Eventually, there is themes of romance but also at times emotions.Highly recommended for a watch~ read more 
Katanagatari and Spice And Wolf are the same kind of romance adventure anime shows. Katanagatari's plot is more samurai action based in Japan Edo period while Spice And Wolf's plot is about merchants in medieval Europe, in both series the main idea in the story is the developing relationship and romance between the two, one male, one female, main characters which is what I mainly liked about both shows. 
The stories are different, one has action and swords and battles and the other has economics and trading.However that's the only major difference I have found.They have similar setting, one in Feudal Japan, and the other in Medieval Europe, so if you're a fan of these settings here you go.They have similar journey, like the Male MC wants to accompany the Female MC on a journey to reach her desired destination. Both shows rely on dialogue and interaction between the main characters.Holo is similar to Togame in many ways; Acting smart, cunning personality and at the same time romantic.The romance is presented in both shows.Highly Recommended. read more 
Spice and Wolf and Katanagatari have different stories, however with the 2 main characters and how they interact with each other, it is actually quite similar.In both anime, the 2 main characters. The female leads the male in both stories and go on a journey together. Bit of romantic moments here and there which adds to their relationships. A bit of jealousy and bit of lovey dovey moments just make the 2 very similar in that aspect. Holo and Lawrence, Shichika and Togame. Both of these couples have good chemistry with each other and makes you kind of buttery inside. Both of these shows have a great romantic sub plot that is well written and if your looking for that, definitely watch one or the other, or even both! read more 
Both of these animes have two main characters female and male which travel around place to place in search of something. Of course since man and women are traveling together it's not so hard to guess that both of these animes have romance in them. The two also show how one character changes the other over their time traveling together through out their adventures overall both animes are similar but unquie in their own special ways. 
Both are series about two people traveling together and mostly focus on dialogues and relationship between them. 
Both have a main couple with a stark difference in power, who constantly tease and banter each other with witty dialog. Both include a journey trough Japan, and complex problems to solve at each station, where she actually is the smarter player. Their romance progresses at similar speed and in a similar way. Both take place in historical Japan, and have fantasy elements on top. "
2966,457,9,"Both very mellow. Both have supernatural elements.Both main male characters looks similar and act the same for the most partxD 
Both shows have a similar pace and main character. Moreover, they are episodic anime about the mysteries of nature (and incarnations of nature too !). 
Both anime had the same kind of atmosphere about them. They were set in olden eras and followed the same kind of easy pace, following traveling characters. Putting that aside, I even thought that Lawrence and Ginko looked vaguely similar as well.  
Both Mushishi and Spice and Wolf are very laid back series, which is nice. They also both focus on solving things; Mushishi it's things that relate to spirits, Spice and Wolf it's related to things that involve trade and commerce. Both series have very good characters and character development as well. And finally, the pair of male leads even look like each other! 
Although the plots are very different, both male protagonists are similar. They are similar in the way they act, travel and see the world. Additionally, they both have deeper meanings built into them, but it is much more prevalent in Mushishi. Spice and Wolf focuses on the depth of person to person interactions while Mushishi explores the interaction between humans and the world around them. 
Both Mushishi and Ookami to Koushinryou are styled after traditional legends and folktales, with fantasy elements delicately intertwined with reality. There is also a sort of inexpressible atmospheric similarity to the shows; one gets the sense that they don't go out of their way to impress the viewer, they simply present their own particular reality. To cite Mushishi,""everything is only as it is."" 
Travelling protagonist visiting various locations of the land, meeting various people and engaging with them, sometimes changing their lives. Also making use of his craft to get around and as a way to sustain his livehood.  
-Both have a relaxed vibe to them.-Both revolve around a traveler/travelers who face new adventures in each location-Both have good music 
This is a genre of anime that I personally am in love with. Both of these animes are about traveling. These two anime manage to blend in fantasy with reality in such a way that will not seem far-fetched at all. Mushishi is a little more calm compared to S&W. Both animes have beautiful art. What I like most about these two animes is that they are both set in a medeval time peroid, although it's harder to see what time  peroid Mushishi is in, it's not as important as it is in Spice and Wholf. Watch both of these anime if you want to set your mind at peace and relax. I highly recommend them! read more "
2966,486,7,"Slow-paced anime about travelling and encountering different cultures.  
Both have jorney as a very important part of the whole story, but Spice and Wolf is one story instead of story-per-episode structure of Kino's Journey. 
Both are very calm, ""chill"", and enchanting, follow a pair's journey across vast landscapes, and often hold very little in the way of action (though tidbits here and there crop up), aside from dialogue exchange and focus on the scenery/townscapes. 
Both are relatively calm shows featuring traveling themes and the dangers of such a life. Kino is more about different cultures and ideas, while Spice deals more with economics and the life of a traveling salesman. 
Both series contain quite a lot similarities tbh:- fantasy/supernatural elements- traveler style genre- an independent and self rigthous main heroine- an adventurous theme- contains dilemma involving other characters as the journey continues - deals with human interaction- similar atmosphere- similar pace- adventure takes different customs as episodes progresses- contains a moral lesson/value for each journey 
Duo of protagonists (technically, if we count Hermes) travelling around the world visiting countries with different customs and interacting with others as we learn the life stories of multiple secondary characters. 
The biggest similarity is the soundtracks for sure, from the opening of first episode I immediately got reminded of Spice&Wolf. Both are sad in an interesting way.Also both series' main characters travel through land to land, only in Spice&Wolf they have a final destination and a non-episodic storyline which mainly involves trading plans and such. But still some plot points are mainly aimed at the audience just like in all episodes of Kino no Tabi.Spice&Wolf has a way more happy atmosphere and is more colourful but the characters have a different kind of dialogue which keeps the interest in them just like in Kino no Tabi.  read more "
2966,5081,5,"Both series are heavily dialogue and character focused.  Both have a very likable female protagonist who teases the male protagonist.   The banter between the two main characters in both shows is pretty interesting to watch.   The two series are also about different things but uses those things to bring two people together romantically.  Spice and Wolf focuses on the life of being a merchant (fundamental economic theory), and Bakemonogatari focuses on the supernatural.   Ultimately, it is the romance of the two shows that keeps things interesting.   
These two series actually have very little similarities. However, if you are looking for great dialogue, these two have it. Both are great series to soak up every word the characters have to say. If you want words and not action (well, maybe a little action) then watch these! 
Heavily dialogue focused series between the main characters. It is not an exaggeration to say that the dialogue drives the story in both anime. Fortunately, the animation during characters' exchange of words is interesting as that it shifts between different objects, adding an unique visual appeal if one grows tired of the dialogue. In the end of each arc, though, the amount of intelligent dialogue would come off as rewarding, as the story always ends in a satisfying way. 
Both anime offer witty banter between the female character and the protagonist, as well as supernatural aspects.  
Both anime are almost entirely dominated by extremely entertaining banter between the main heroine and protagonists of each show, though Bakemonogatari has multiple female protagonists each with their own personalities that bring a unique flair to the discourses (like Hitagi being the sadistic tsundere, threatening Koyomi with physical harm). Each series has an interesting, if sometimes little explored backdrop, like the supernatural lore in Monogatari, or the interesting economic schemes Lawrence and Holo find themselves wrapped up in. "
2966,4081,4,"Both animes follow the relation between a human and a supernatural being.They're also both soft paced and leave a good felling afterwards.Both great to relax, smile and take a break from heavier animes. 
Spice and Wolf and Natsume Yuujinchou are rather episodic anime that focus on the development of the two main character's relationships.  While the relationship between Natsume and Nyanko is not romantic it is similiar the the relationship between Horo and Lawerance in that it is between two beings who would ordinarily not get along, Natsume a human and Nyanko a youkai, Lawerance a human and Horo a wolf diety. 
The main characters in both encounter a supernatural being which they become very close with. Both stories are easygoing and relatively peaceful to watch. Each show beautifully incorporates music at the right times to set the mood of the story. 
Protagonist meets the reincarnation of a supernatural being and soon learns more about his own surroundings. "
2966,1535,4,"Spice and Wolf is the Death Note of romance anime.  You have a similar plotting protagonist - not one who's out to rule the world, but rather the marketplace.  If you enjoyed the ""out-thinking my opponents"" and ""conceiving and executing a plan in the face of adversity"" of Death Note, Spice and Wolf will give you more of the same.In addition, both have supernatural companions who have enhanced senses that help them in their plotting.  Light, however, isn't in love with Ryuk =p 
Both feature a god dropping from the sky and forming a partnership with a mortal young man and both main characters use their wits and intelligence to overcome any obstacle.  
The only thing similar about these anime, and the reason i loved them both, is because they cause you to think about certain events rather than just mindlessly watching it. 
These 2 require a whole lotta thinking in order to understand what the hell the characters are talking about.  Also, both of them have 2 story arcs that make up the entirety of the anime.  Some fast-paced and climactic moments are included as well. "
2966,9253,3,"Ookami to Koushinryou (Spice and Wolf) and Steins;Gate are similar in being both serious and humorous at times followed by the growing bond of relationships and the troubling events that follow. 
-Highly intellectual in many ways.-Intriguingly able to keep you on your toes at all times with suspense.-Both explain what's going on well so that the watcher doesn't lose track of what's going on even though things can get chaotic.-One is about time travel and the other economics, but the plot in both can get very thick. 
Spice and wolf is very good if a big part of what you liked about Stein's gate was the Romance and banter between the male and female leads and vice versa. Thier setting are very different (medieval Europe and modern Japan) as is what drives thier plot (economics or time travel) not to mention that spice & wolf more has a few very short arcs connected by the journey of it's leads than a main plot unlike Stein's gate. The banter and slow developing romance between the two leads are very charming and funny though (Spice and Wolf and Stein's gate are rivals for me for anime with best banter) and the association between the leads in both shows is reinforced to me at least by the male MC's sharing the same english voice actor (Lawrence and Okabe). Oh and a lot of the plots in the show are about medieval mercentile economics, don't worry too much if you have difficulty following that stuff as you should still enjoy it (I did). read more "
2966,37450,3,"The banter between the male/female leads is clever, witty, and realistic. If you liked this series for it's romance, drama, and slice of life elements, then you'll like this one as well. These are two of the best romances out there. Read the Light Novels if you enjoy them! 
The appeal of both series come from the back-and-forth dialogues between the main couple.Both are Romances with a twist. Spice and Wolf has a merchant trying to trade efficiently (it's much more fun than it sounds) and Bunny girl senpai has characters dealing with a fictional disease called puberty syndrome (it's much more fun than it sounds).Both are light novel adaptations. 
The Waifu is wonderful like Spice and Wolf, good male protagonist, not just a dumb shit, a story a little different than usual and interesting, and charismatics supporting characters. "

Yes. The genders are reversed (DO NOT WANT MALE HOWO--NO!) from S&W's pairing but that matters not when the movie is about half wolf, half human children coming to terms with life. (What more could you ask for from an unofficial S&W movie, really?...well, maybe Lawrence and Howo getting it on, BUT THINK OF THE CHILDREN!)And S&W3 is the next film of the TGWLTT / Summer Wars guy?

Samurai Champloo is based around two samurai, Jin and Mugen, helping Fuu on her journey to find the samurai that smells like sunflowers. It lacks the kind of romance in Spice and Wolf but the characters dynamics between Jin, Mugen, and Fuu are just as interesting as the dynamics between Lawrence and Holo.Both stories are set in a past historical setting with anachronisms thrown in. In Spice and Wolf, Holo feels that the village no longer needs her, which is why she wants to return to her homeland. There is also the feeling that pagan traditions are slowly being replaced by Christianity.In Samurai Champloo, Fuu is worried that their journey will come to an end just like Holo is worried that she will have to leave Lawrence one day and that If she chooses to stay she will eventually outlive him. Both Fuu and Holo have to come to terms with the end of their Journeys. The message in both animes is that it's not the outcome but the journey that matters. read more "
