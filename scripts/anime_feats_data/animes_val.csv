7,"While Gintoki Sakata was away, the Yorozuya found themselves a new leader: Kintoki, Gintoki's golden-haired doppelganger.

Between Kintoki and Gintoki, who will claim the throne as the main character?

In addition, Yorozuya make a trip back down to red-light district of Yoshiwara to aid an elderly courtesan in her search for her long-lost lover. Although the district is no longer in chains beneath the earth's surface, the trio soon learn of the tragic backstories of Yoshiwara's inhabitants that still haunt them. With flashback after flashback, this quest has Yorozuya witnessing everlasting love and protecting it as best they can with their hearts and souls.

Gintama': Enchousen includes moments of action-packed intensity along with their usual lighthearted, slapstick humor for Gintoki and his friends.

                              This might be the shortest season of Gintama but I love everything about it, from the Kintama Arc which solidified my love for both the characters and for their bond; to the courtesan of nation arc which is pumping me up for the future serious arcs and let me tell you that that arc has one of the best music, fight scene and storyline in the series; to the Beam Sword Style Arc which made me wonder if I should take it seriously or not because the whole thing is both good and farcical and of course there's Sadaharu, our gigantic and adorable dog. 
                              There are some differences between seasons of Gintama one of most important is that Gintama is getting more serious first season is more like a comedy one second and third and bit serious and like this till the end. There are lot of people who don't really like this and i will say its personal, I like where it’s going because it has potential this way too and i like that they are using it and I must also say that comedy part isn't lost its just got less. Third season consists of 12 episodes so it’s more serious than comedic, it consists of two          
                              One of the big Enchousen things is that it covers the Kintama and Courtesan of a Nation arcs, which is a turning point on the series, become more plot-oriented and entering the whole political concept of the story, since it's based on the Edo period. 
                              This season is so interesting because it's entirely filled with episodes that carry a serious tone. Gintama is always funny, but everything from the three arcs in this season to the only episodic-type episode carried emotional content. And I loved it.
                              Already wrote a review on one of the Gintama long series but I am to finish for all of the 6 Gintama on MAL just cause i'm bias AF.
                              (This review applies to the entire Gintama series.)
                              *This review is spoiler free
                              This is my first review on an anime. I'll try to write my best and try to keep it simple.
                              This was the shortest of the Gintama Arcs but it actually packs a lot in for 13 episodes. There are 3 main Arcs and few one-shot episodes. 
                              Gintama' Enchousen, one of the top anime on the list and there's only like 3 episodes out..  that says alot right there. to people who think gintama is overrated, try watching it. It's not bad, in fact its great. Give it a try, and this dipshit afdal is just bitching out because his favorite anime wasn't number one
                              Okay this is my first time writing a review. So let's give this a shot.
                              --Sorry for my English, I'm from a non-English speaking country--
                              Gintama is the most awesome anime I've ever watched, it's true that there are many great animes out there but I find them too common. Like for example, Naruto, Bleach or One piece which have almost the same plot, but I admit those three animes are good too. I'm just saying my opinion, so I think Gintama deserved to be number 1. It's almost an all in one anime. There are fights, romance, comedy and many more that you can't see in other animes. It's whole new different anime so if you haven't finished watching it yet. DON'T FRIGGIN' JUDGE. ",7
12,"The Amanto, aliens from outer space, have invaded Earth and taken over feudal Japan. As a result, a prohibition on swords has been established, and the samurai of Japan are treated with disregard as a consequence.

However one man, Gintoki Sakata, still possesses the heart of the samurai, although from his love of sweets and work as a yorozuya, one might not expect it. Accompanying him in his jack-of-all-trades line of work are Shinpachi Shimura, a boy with glasses and a strong heart, Kagura with her umbrella and seemingly bottomless stomach, as well as Sadaharu, their oversized pet dog. Of course, these odd jobs are not always simple, as they frequently have run-ins with the police, ragtag rebels, and assassins, oftentimes leading to humorous but unfortunate consequences.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.96,8,14,115,762411,48648,"                              Gintama? Gintama. Hmmm, Gintama... Gintama or not Gintama, that is the question.
                              Gintama is an ongoing manga by Sorachi Hideaki. From 2006 to 2010, Sunrise, the same studio behind the Gundam franchise, did an anime adaptation which lasted for just over 200 episodes. So, does the anime manage to stay entertaining for that long, or even be entertaining at all? Let’s take a peek and find out.
                              Gintama is a masterclass in comedy writing and variety; a series that grows in originality with each passing episode, so inventive and fresh, dynamic and interesting, it's no wonder it has become one of Sunrises' flagship series, not to mention a mainstay of Shounen Jump.
                              Gintama is a very inconsistent and overrated series. 
                              It’s always baffled me how Gintama fans think a series with pretty much 80% filler and 20% story is a “masterpiece” and the “best anime ever!!1!”
                              Gintama to be symbolized is like a bottle of fine apple cider. Its not the hot cinnamon one you enjoy at  winter time, but a bubbly and sweet drink enjoyed alongside some of the finest of your holiday wines.  Gintama is sweet. With a cast of bubbling and energetic characters who lift spirits. They just make the show sizzle with satisfying pops. At first Gintama feels like a kiddy drink laughable and nothing more. As you slow down and enjoy Gintama it becomes something more.  There is certain tartness mixed in, a hint of something more dramatic, this only materializes itself once          
                              At first I was very skeptical towards the idea of watching this anime. For you see, to watch Gintama one must have a profound knowledge on Japanese pop-culture and language (as the show doesn't lack puns and references), none of which I have. Nevertheless, if you are one to appreciate a good laugh and a chaotic story line, Gintama is the anime for you.
                              I've never really been a fan of long-running shounen anime. I had some bad run-ins with series like Naruto and Bleach when I was a kid and ever since then I've tried my best to stay away from them. For the same reason, I'm quite sure I would never have made myself watch Gintama either if it wasn't for its incredibly high ratings which made me feel somewhat obligated to. When I eventually started it though about 1,5 years ago, it was very quickly made evident that Gintama is... different. Not just different from other shounen anime, but different from almost every anime. In many          
                              Before I write this review which is very long overdue I would like to first establish that Gintama is my favourite series in both the manga and anime mediums and it is something that I will carry with me forever, it took me out of a very dark part in my life and set me on the right path. Gintama is something that becomes better as time moves on and you learn more about Japanese culture (of course, manga and anime) looking back at the series but it is also a very compelling story with slowly arching storyline with some really emotional moments and just          
                              (Note: At the moment I am reviewing this I have completed every single seasons of Gintama so I am reviewing the Gintama as a whole series not just Season 1.)
                              My first review ever, and unfortunately a negative one, but i'll do my best to explain why i'm giving it such a score.
                              Comedy that never once fails to make us laugh
                              Gintama has become somewhat of a favourite amongst many in the anime community, as evident to anyone who views the Top Anime on MAL. However, does popularity directly correlate to quality? With a 5/10 rating, it's obvious my answer is no, but why exactly is that?
                              Comedy is a genre which can be very difficult to appeal to the majority of people, as it is heavily dependent on ones preferences, as well as his own past experiences with the medium. Besides these limitations, there is an other factor that plays a role, which are the cultural differences that exist in current society, as a lot of comedy is dependent on the understanding of said cultural customs. This is done in the West through various types, such as satires, sitcoms, cringe comedies or slapstick comedies; in the East, particularly Japan, this done through the most known type of comedy, the Manzai, or

13,"When Gintoki apprehends a movie pirate at a premiere, he checks the camera's footage and finds himself transported to a bleak, post-apocalyptic version of Edo, where a mysterious epidemic called the ""White Plague"" has ravished the world's population. It turns out that the movie pirate wasn't a pirate after all—it was an android time machine, and Gintoki has been hurtled five years into the future! Shinpachi and Kagura, his Yorozuya cohorts, have had a falling out and are now battle-hardened solo vigilantes and he himself has been missing for years, disappearing without a trace after scribbling a strange message in his journal.

Setting out in the disguise given to him by the android time machine, Gintoki haphazardly reunites the Yorozuya team to investigate the White Plague, and soon discovers that the key to saving the future lies in the darkness of his own past. Determined to confront a powerful foe, he makes an important discovery—with a ragtag band of friends and allies at his side, he doesn't have to fight alone.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.96,8,15,876,172033,2204,"                              With this movie, Gintama has reached even greater heights. Compared to the previous movie, Gintama: The Final Chapter - Be Forever Yorozuya isn't a retelling of an arc, but a story of Gin's past. Many fans throughout the Gintama franchise have always wanted an arc focusing about Gin's past during the Joui War, and now we get it. As a Gintama fan, you will definitely want to watch this movie about his past and how he tries to cope about what is to come of him. 
                              The new Gintama movie is a side story that delivers some laughs and new character designs, but is totally convoluted. Asking Gintama to make sense is kind of a faux-pas. It's demented on purpose. But what starts off as an absurdist comedy quickly devolves into boring shounen fan pandering. The movie follows 265 episodes, a recap film, plus a series of practically unrelated OVAs. In conclusion it is a minor entry in the series overall, but is certainly not worth missing for any Gintama fan.
                              I laughed, I cried, I felt. I cursed myself for not viewing it sooner. Be Forever Yorozuya encapsulates everything that makes Gintama in a two hour, finely wrapped package. If the tv series weren’t returning as of next year, I could think of no better way to send off the series.   
                              Easy to understand Gintama review:
                              Ok I will have to be honest, I am a new comer to the Gintama series and I heard it was fantastic and I was excited to watch it. I do not know all of the characters personally well but I invited my friends to watch it with me who were also new and OH BOY OK NOW TO GET TO THE REVIEW. ( I would like to point my knowledge of the series first)
                              I found this movie extremely enjoyable, from the start all the way until the end, it was hilarious! 
                              Being a fan of Gintama, I really looked forward to this movie. I was not really let down, but maybe that was because I already knew what was coming.
                              As if the anime wasn't incredibly good already...I really think this second film really tops both the series and the previous movie. It had all the elements of what makes the show so good including a wacky intro making it classic Gintama from the get-go.
                              Well to start off it should come by no surprise that i feel that this moive is awesome by my score.
                              *This review contains no spoiler*
                              ""THIS MOVIE IS BAD""... if there's someone who said something like that i dont know their reaction about other anime movie then ( or maybe they were drunk when they said that )
                              Advice: don't skip the beginning even though it seems like an ad
                              Gintama: Kanketsu-hen - Yorozuya yo Eien Nare, or Gintama: The Final Chapter - Be Forever Yorozuya, is the second film in the Gintama franchise, written by the author of Gintama,  Hideaki Sorachi. Written as a possible end to the anime, this film brings Gintama into darker and more dramatic territory, more so then ever before, whilst still balancing the film with the humour that made the series so popular. All this, and more, is all blended together to create one of the best anime films created in modern days.
                              I was a little worried at first because I hadn't watched gintama in a while and I thought that I was holding expectations that were too high, but of course, the movie reminded me that gintama will never disappoint. 
                              I remember all the laughs I had watching Gintama. I was so excited for this movie and it had been lost in my memories until now after waiting for English subtitles. I was right to be excited for this movie because it was... absolutely amazing. Many things in the movie might seem plain like the plot but the creators of the movie have dug deeper and expressed them more thoroughly which can get to the reader even more than a regular scene. The classic jokes of Gintama never fail and the transitions between serious and humor are great too. If you don't watch Gintama, I          ",13

As Shirou Emiya, Rin Toosaka, and Illyasviel von Einzbern discover the true, corruptive nature of the shadow that has been rampaging throughout the city, they realize just how dire the situation is. In order to protect their beloved ones, the group must hold their own against the seemingly insurmountable enemy force—even if some of those foes were once their allies, or perhaps, something more intimate.

As the final act of this chaotic war commences, the ideals Shirou believes will soon be challenged by an excruciating dilemma: is it really possible to save a world where everything seems to have gone wrong?

                              This is candid review. Because I can't express this ultra masterpiece well. Please come with me if you're a patient person.
                              Watched it yesterday
                              First of all, would like to state that this film has popped my review cherry after hundreds of anime/movies watched. That in itself would mean of either two things, that it is terrible or that it is a masterpiece. Fortunately, it is the latter that is true. This masterpiece of a film has managed to make it my personal favourite route of the big three routes with three 2-hour films compared to two seasons of 20+ episodes each and one single 24 episodes anime. Now proceeding with the review.
                              Just watched it last night and I want to preface this (non-spoiler) review by saying that I feel blessed to have been able to catch this in a cinema despite these unprecedented times. I hope that all Fate fans will get the opportunity to experience watching this in a cinema as the world recovers.
                              Anime has offered many amazing works of psychological and philosophical exploration. The medium is ripe for exploring these themes with the ability of animation to depict the surreal in ways live action cannot. These works demand a certain level of risk, as it's far easier to tell the audience what they want to hear rather than what they need to hear. Heaven's Feel feels like the excited musings of a young fan of this genre that thinks they're ready to join the ranks of the elite but lacks the modesty to understand they have much to learn. It wants to play with the big boys,

                              When I walked out of the theatre after watching this, I couldn't believe what I had just witnessed. It was like some Lovecraftian shit where my human mind could not comprehend what had happened. What I know for sure is that this is hands down, without a shadow of a doubt, the best anime movie I have ever seen.
                              Ufotable outdid themselves with this movie. This film easily has the best animation in the entire Fate franchise. Perhaps even Fate's best animated fight, and most epic scenes. If you want an amazing soundtrack, this movie has it. This is the conclusion of this trilogy, and I haven't seen a more epic conclusion in a long time. As a fan of the Fate franchise, I loved these characters from the start, and seeing their stories come to an end here left me satisfied. I love this movie, and I love Fate.
                              I had the privilege to watch this in theater, and my oh my what a good movie from ufotable. 
                              So, Heaven's Feel III. I had already been expecting high quality animations, but this blew those expectations out of the water. Seriously, this was incredible. ",24

                              Hajime no Ippo (Fighting Spirit) is a fantastic Shounen, Sports, Comedy, Action anime produced by one of the greatest studios ever (Madhouse). Even though it doesn’t tell the entire story, the story it does tell is truly amazing, with all its manliness.
                              Hajime no Ippo.
                              There are plenty of stories about a young man finding some sort of passion and following it to some sort of logical conclusion, and Hajime no Ippo chooses not to stray from that basic idea very far. Luckily for original creator Morikawa George, not straying far from this premise seems to be the recipe for a successful comic that has lasted more than 1000 chapters week after week since its original Shounen Magazine publishing in 1989. This adaptation by Madhouse and director Nishimura Satoshi is longer than your usual TV anime run, at 75 episodes, but it doesn't quite cover the incredible length of Nishimura's          
                              This is probably the best sports anime I've seen (and I've seen a bunch of them).  It isn't gorgeous visually and it isn't original and it isn't unpredictable... and I don't even like boxing.  But it's still really really entertaining to watch anyway.  And doesn't that say something?

                              Fantastic, Excellent, Superb! - Do not judge by its cover or genre. 10/10!
                              Hajime no Ippo is widely considered one the greatest if not the greatest sports anime ever made! The manga has been running since the 1980s, but it has managed to avoid feeling too stale or repetitive. Everyone simply can't get enough of this series! I will now try to explain what makes Hajime no Ippo so special to so many.
                              Hajime no Ippo is a series that was very inspiring to me.
                              Rather than try to review a ton of aspects of a 76 episode show, I want to give a few specific criticisms.

The movie tries to be all at once, but the story and genre are at odds with each other; it strives to have a tragic flair, but also wants to beat you over the head with fanservice and cutesy staff. The result is a boatload of forced drama and conflicts which gets resolved in 10 minutes and has no effect on          
                              Rarely does a show or movie fully capture its given arc without compromise; various cuts and streamlining measures have become generally what to expect. However, in this particular instance, Kinema Citrus have evidently gone the extra mile to make sure as little as possible is left out. Only a very negligible amount of minor content was cut or changed from the source material, and the overall experience doesn’t suffer for it in the slightest. If you’re already a fan of the series, particularly the anime, then you will know roughly what bar of quality to expect. Rich visuals, stirring soundtrack, atmospheric sound design, great attention          
                              TL;DR: A sequel film that severely damages the legacy of its predecessor by introducing cheap plot contrivances and exacerbating previous issues with uncomfortable ""fanservice"".
                              When I first watched Made in Abyss TV series, I was truly mesmerized by its storytelling and worldbuilding. It was a step above of any fantasy genre anime I have ever watched. Therefore, I was excited to watch Made in Abyss Fukaki Tamashii no Reimei in the theater. After I watched the movie, I can say for sure that it is a masterpiece. 
                              Overall the movie was decent, but it left me pretty disappointed with a few things.

45,"Takashi Natsume, the timid youkai expert and master of the Book of Friends, continues his journey towards self-understanding and acceptance with the help of friends both new and old. His most important ally is still his gluttonous and sake-loving bodyguard, the arrogant but fiercely protective wolf spirit Madara—or Nyanko-sensei, as Madara is called when in his usual disguise of an unassuming, pudgy cat.

Natsume, while briefly separated from Nyanko-sensei, is ambushed and kidnapped by a strange group of masked, monkey-like youkai, who have spirited him away to their forest as they desperately search for the Book of Friends. Realizing that his ""servant"" has been taken out from right under his nose, Nyanko-sensei enlists the help of Natsume's youkai friends and mounts a rescue operation. However, the forest of the monkey spirits holds many dangerous enemies, including the Matoba Clan, Natsume's old nemesis.

Stretching from the formidable hideout of the Matoba to Natsume's own childhood home, Natsume Yuujinchou Shi is a sweeping but familiar return to a world of danger and friendship, where Natsume will finally confront the demons of his own past.

                              What? It's over already?! 
                              Hmm..... how do you review an anime considered to be a sleeper masterpiece? How do you place a rank on the underdog? How, I ask those who are reading this review, How?
                              This entire series is just one sad dog. However, there is an evolution to it. The first season, was like a 3 legged puppy found in a garbage bag, barely alive and bruised. The second season, was the same dog being nursed to health. Still sad mind you. The third, the dog is nearly healthy, an all the bruises are gone. Now, it's just a three legged dog with a big smile. 
                              I'm so glad i found this anime. Natsume really brought me to tears , both happy and sad. This season is probably my favorite though. It goes into deep detail about his family, his past life and his friends. Natsume begins to open up more to yokai and his human friends. This anime is honestly so uplifting. Through out the seasons , this season he finally accepts how happy he is, all the new people he met, and happily accepting that he can see yokai. I literally feel like i watched natsume grow up and toughen up into a person he truly was from the          
                               I highly suggest watching the other season's first.
                                                                     Natsume's Book of Friends
                              Of all anime I have seen Natsume Yuujinchou able to give a nice prequels something that a must watch. This fourth season is the one I will give a review because it is the one that gives me a heart-stirring. Each Natsume Yuujinchou season has a progressive story and little by little revealed the mystery. The art and sound are still stunning and relaxing. The seiyuu able to portray a calm or compose vibe to the character of Natsume. I also like the eccentric relationship of nyanko-sensei and Natsume. In this season, the one you should look forward to is the involvement of nyanko-sensei. Overall,          
                              I love Natsume Yuujinchou to bits. And, although it seems rather pointless to write a review on an instalment in a series, I actually find it beneficial to look back on each season and see what each individual season accomplished, especially since Nartsume Yuujinchou is one of those series that doesn't have an particular end goal or big boss to defeat. 
                              This season was so. freakin'. good. I did not expect this anime to go into such detail about Natsume's background-- and I loved it!

                              The review will be mainly of the first 4 seasons.
                              Overall, I had to shed many tears with the aid of  my small box of tissues while watching this series. It's also a bit-heart-wrenching, (not in a devastatingly bad way....) because of the sad memories that came back with all the flashbacks the main protagonist keeps reminiscing..but this series, and the prequels before it are very heart-lifting in a spirituous @ soulful way (I guess that's what they'd call it, maybe?) But yeah, so, if you're looking for something way off different from the charts of ""normal anime"" and want a bit of scare but with a lighter tone and maybe with a bit          
                              This anime was far beyong perfection. This may sound a little over-exaggerated, but I find this anime to be a true masterpiece. I idolize Midorikawa Yuki, the mangaka of the manga, for I love not only her stories, but also her art. It is simply beautiful and I really appreciate her talent. The music of Natsume Yuujinchou was just as beautiful and fitting as the characters. Every character had their own special trait. I loved every single one, as well as the Yokai. I could really identify myself with most of them. Natsume Takashi had made me become more aware of life and understand the

Although they are required to take tests daily, the children are free to spend their time as they see fit, usually playing outside, as long as they do not venture too far from the orphanage—a rule they are expected to follow no matter what. However, all good times must come to an end, as every few months, a child is adopted and sent to live with their new family, never to be heard from again.

However, the three oldest siblings have their suspicions about what is actually happening at the orphanage, and they are about to discover the cruel fate that awaits the children living at Grace Field, including the twisted nature of their beloved Mama.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.65,8,54,55,1145833,32782,"                              I will admit that I'm generally not a very big fan of shounens, but Yakusoku no Neverland is in my opinion without a doubt the best thing to have ever spawned from Weekly Shounen Jump. Then again it needs to be said that it is not very similar to most other things from the same magazine.
                              *SPOILER WARNING. I WILL BE SPOILING THE FIRST EPISODE OF THIS SHOW. IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOU GO IN BLIND TO GET THE FULL EFFECT OF THIS SHOW IF YOU HAVE NOT WATCHED IT ALREADY*
                              Yakusoku no Neverland is a great anime. Despite of it's short comings and endless possibilities of being better it's still a great piece of work I say is better than most of its counterparts. 
                              Yakusoku no Neverland is the biggest disappointment of the year so far. Not so much because it was so exceptionally bad, but because it had potential to be outstandingly great. What looked like a prime example of well-build thriller and highly atmospheric mystery end up being just a bunch of empty promises. Perhaps the English title, 'Promised Neverland' is actually a self-parody since following the series was an experience far from magical. At least one thing the series foreshows, I guess. 
                              Horror is a genre that I rarely see effectively executed in anime. In fact, the genre itself seems to be pretty scarce in the anime medium. The first episode of The Promised Neverland perfectly encapsulates how to properly utilize horror. The atmosphere is great. We’re presented with a seemingly happy orphanage life being lived out by the characters, all children, and their “mama.” Yet as the viewer, it becomes apparent that everything's not quite what it seems, and there’s just this sort of unnerving tension in the air. The presentation is also top notch. Visuals and music are handled expertly and are very complementary to          
                              The Promised Neverland is a great psychological thriller manga, but this adaptation trades complex psychological warfare for conventional horror. The mystery is simplified, the characters lack depth due to the absence of inner monologues, and the artwork is mediocre. In spite of these shortcomings, constant tension and decent scares make it watchable.
                              Let’s think for a minute on how fragile human lives is. We can die by so many different ways that it’s frightening to think about. Immortality is a far cry from a reality. In a desolate world where kids realize that their entire lives has been prepared for death, it feels like a living in a nightmare. To live in fear is also frightening to think about. Don’t believe me? Just ask Emma, Ray, and Norman.
                              The answer to this question is totally in the eye of the beholder, but in your eyes, what would you say makes a good concept? While some prefer thematic depth, others emotional poignancy, and others sheer creativity, I am of the belief a concept can only be proportionally valuable to its execution. An ingenious conceit can bog itself down an infinite number of ways in scripting, just as a stock setup can write its way to a masterpiece. The Promised Neverland is a show which constantly toes the line between squandering and strengthening its unique and exciting concept which, in the right hands, could’ve easily          
                              The Promised Neverland is the type of anime that is better enjoyed by going in blind. It heavily relies on suspense, mind games and reveals. So those who haven't watched the show should stay away from reviews and should only decide to watch it based on the genre and MAL synopsis.

Caught up in the bloodshed was Violet Evergarden, a young girl raised for the sole purpose of decimating enemy lines. Hospitalized and maimed in a bloody skirmish during the War's final leg, she was left with only words from the person she held dearest, but with no understanding of their meaning.

Recovering from her wounds, Violet starts a new life working at CH Postal Services after a falling out with her new intended guardian family. There, she witnesses by pure chance the work of an ""Auto Memory Doll,"" amanuenses that transcribe people's thoughts and feelings into words on paper. Moved by the notion, Violet begins work as an Auto Memory Doll, a trade that will take her on an adventure, one that will reshape the lives of her clients and hopefully lead to self-discovery.

At least that’s what it looked like on the surface. The light novel series earned the grand prize from the Fifth Kyoto Animation in the novel category. Even with two volumes, my expectations going into this anime was high. In particular, the sheer visual quality is a sight to feast on. However, Violet Evergarden isn’t exactly just known for that but does that mean it’s something to be praised?

                              Violet Evergarden game out in 2018 to near universal acclaim from the online anime community. The premise is…kind odd. The main heroine is an ice cold, killing machine with supernatural abilities and amnesia. Sounds pretty anime so far. However, her country is now at peace and her days of slaughtering faceless mooks are over. So, she decides to get a career ghost writing love letters in order to learn what love is like. The way to get a 9.00 rating on MAL is apparently to mix Elfen Lied with Cyrano de Bergerac.
                              RANT WARNING: Too many anime fans, apparently, have become accustomed to having things spelled out for them via some combination of long narration and excessively expository dialogue between characters.
                              Violet Evergarden was one of the most anticipated anime of the winter season, with its stunning promotional material showcasing beautifully animated scenes and character designs. It could be said that in that regard it was amazing and lived up to expectations. However, when it comes to the characters and overall narrative, sadly it isn't nearly as good as it could have been. The main problem can be associated with a lackluster cast of characters in combination with a seemingly aimless narrative.
                              Violet Evergarden is an anime series adaptation of the novel light with the same title from Kyoto Animation.

                              Sincere. If I were to describe Violet Evergarden with a single word, it would be just that, sincere. It is a slow burn slice of life that makes up for its lack of narrative complexity with earnest, empathetic drama.

As the radio tower in Leidenschaftlich continues to be built, telephones will soon become more relevant, leading to a decline in demand for ""Auto Memory Dolls."" Even so, Violet Evergarden continues to rise in fame after her constant success with writing letters. However, sometimes the one thing you long for is the one thing that does not appear.

Violet Evergarden Movie follows Violet as she continues to comprehend the concept of emotion and the meaning of love. At the same time, she pursues a glimmer of hope that the man who once told her, ""I love you,"" may still be alive even after the many years that have passed.

Mere month after I've seen final Fate/stay night Heaven's Feel movie I come back this time to Kyoto. Is it better than super hit from ufotable? It doesn't matter actually, I'm speechless. And in love. TV series has few flaws, plot pretty bland and predictable, simplified to the border.

                              I see that all of the first 3 reviews gave this movie a perfect 10/10. I can understand where their opinion comes from and respect people who think this was a perfect ending for Violet's story, but I have to personally disagree and give this film a 7/10. It's still far better than average, but the ending misses the mark entirely for me. I will state my reasons below, first in a spoiler-free section and then in a spoiler section.

                              First of all, thank you KyoAni for giving out such masterpiece despite suffering through a horrific incident. 
                              As time passes, nothing stays the same. Familiar places become unfamiliar, and even people you have known for many years will change along with the passage of time. Violet Evergarden Movie masterfully explores this theme by following the life of its protagonist, Violet Evergarden. 
                              I do not usually write reviews for anime, but after seeing the Violet Evergarden film today here in Sydney, I just felt like I have to put a few words down regarding my own opinions and views of this amazing film I just witnessed. I remember leaving the cinema stunned and speechless, there are a few anime films that leave me with the same feeling of awe because of the depth and power of its artistic beauty and emotional depth. I can definitely state that the Violet Evergarden film – for me at least – is one of those rare anime films; like Princess Mononoke;

                              ""Violet Evergarden"" (VE) is a story about what it means to be human. Our titular protagonist starts off as a machine-like soldier, a weapon of war. When the war ends, she's hired to serve as a Doll - exemplary servants charged with crafting tailor-made letters for their clients. Violet's profession leads her to encounter people from various walks of life. She acts as a first-hand witness to her clients' humanity, watching as their desires and feelings gradually emerge. Violet's letters conveyed emotions to others, and those emotions reached her in turn. Her empathy blossoms, transforming the stoic Doll into a caring, resilient individual. Now that          
                              I can't express in words how this movie was so breathtaking and captivating. The art, the character, the story, the music, and more all played a wonderful part and it all made sense. I can't tell you the number of times the movie moved me to tears. I'm honestly still a little tearful as I write this. I am giving this 10/10 for being able to convey emotion and the struggles on how it is to convey it at times. I give it a 10/10 because at times I feel as though my empathy for others has lessened over some time, I felt rather numb          
                              Beautiful and meaningful; just like I wanted!
                              Yet again, KyoAni wields the power of words hardly spoken, the power of human emotion, and the power of masterful animation, sound and art to work their way into the hearts of their audience. The conflict, pain, longing and regret in our characters are gripping, and stays true to how well the series delivered it. Sasuga KyoAni.",56

                              Kimetsu no Yaiba is a pleasant surprise. Though it first appears to merely be another overly grim and dark series lauded for its gore, it is is revealed to be much more as the series progresses. Hypocrisy, mortality, hope and despair run as prevalent themes in Tanjiro's tragic journey. The myriad ways in which this journey could reach its demise run tense in the heart and the mind of the viewer, as mercy is seldom a consideration to the demons he must annihilate.
                              Ah ufotable, the studio that keeps on giving. Before Kimetsu no Yaiba aired, news broke out that we’d get them animating the show. And to my delight, it’s a studio that earned its praise for its high caliber animation and consistently delivering quality content. Being their first 2-cour show (without a split cour break), Kimetsu no Yaiba is a special gift not just for the manga fans but anyone ready to experience a world of demons and dark fantasy.
                              Oh boy, the seasonal battle shounen that everyone raves about, what does it do right? Well to be completely honest, nothing, the only thing it got going for it is the production quality from ufotable.
                              Welp...I'm late to this party! Time to review the most overrated shonen garbage of the last 5 years! Demon Slayer is an anime that absolutely EVERYONE watched last year. Except for me of course, because I was watching bad hentai to make comedy reviews on the internet! I went in with pretty damn high expectations. As of January 2020, DS is rated the #20 greatest anime of all time on MAL and the #1 anime of all time on Kitsu. I'm dead serious! The kids on Kitsu truly think that this is the GOAT. Galactic Heroes? Ping Pong? Lain? Ashita no Joe? No! Fuck that          
                              Only cynical criticism can save us from the gooey sentimentality and naivete, but sometimes rarely a series too precious to deserve this treatment appears, offering nothing but genuine entertainment to a point where its own shortcomings start to seem very insignificant compared to its strongest merits. I may have a soft spot in my heart for this series, but all the things I found to be problematic within the work are still covered here in this review and explained why I think they can be forgiven, because even with all of its problems, this is -in its own way- one of the greatest series seen          
                              Maybe it’s just because I’ve gone old and crotchety, but I’ve been really disappointed with ufotable lately. Maybe even that is too harsh. I’ve just felt so out of touch with them for the past three and a half to four years since they seem to have completely abandoned their old selves. Whether it be the astronomical success of the Fate/Grand Order mobile game, or the fair success of their own Tales of Symphonia OVA BD sales, ufotable has apparently honed in on game adaptations.

                                 Ahhh, Demon Slayer. If I were to describe you in very short terms, it would be ""a show with decent to mediocre content overshadowed by its own technical achievement.""
                              Once upon a time, the anime industry came up with the perfect formula to create highly acclaimed shounen one after the other; however, as time passed, this pattern became repetitive and, while a few next-gen shounen have been able to achieve their objective following this predetermined path, most of them have faltered along the way.

                              In life sometimes you get bored of the hobbies you used to have as a child. Anime is one of them in my case. After being disappointed season after season with countless fast food adaptations. I decided to put a stop at my once favorite hobby.
                              Finally we have it, the new anime about loud teenagers with cool swords fighting the ultimate evil. Another shonen jump work which I ultimately like, but have a hard time describing the experience as not frustrating. So let’s get to that.
                              I never really write reviews, but I feel like I had to for this one.
                              Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba is a Japanese dark fantasy, adventure manga series by Koyoharu Gotōge with an anime adaptation by Ufotable, directed by Haruo Sotozaki and produced by Hikaru Kondo. Season 1 began airing on April 6th, 2019 with the final episode of the season airing on September 28th, 2019.
                              Kimetsu no Yaiba, or Demon Slayer, an overhyped, overrated and over almost everything show that fans can't stop praising and talking about this hell of a mess.",60

Coming out of his enormous success with previous Jojo’s parts, having a huge follow up by fans, and probably being laurelled by praise of his editors, it would be simple for him to accommodate. To stop trying, challenging himself and coming with ways for improvement. This movement is something Araki does not fall into, though to the expense of failing hard the ceiling of his own works above him.
                              As I sat and finished watching the 39-episode saga of Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure: Golden Wind, I had a small tear in my eye. It’s aftermath result of this extraordinary adventure. Crafted from the mind of Hirohiko Araki, he managed to bring his ideas to life with brilliance, charisma, and beauty. For how this show turned out in the end, I can easily say that the 5th part of the iconic Jojo franchise is one to welcome with open arms.
                              This fifth instalment of JoJo tells, of a group of boys in search of justice and a world that, thanks to them and their heroism, will begin to change for the better. Boys who live, sacrifice themselves, fight against an apparently incontrovertible destiny, bringing with them an resolute spirit, a golden wind that blows away the injustices from the world.
                              I don't even know where to start.
                              I'm a sucker for a good Jojo anime, but this would be the first one I have formally reviewed.
                              TLDR;
                              If I could recommend a show that isn't too long but has a great story with characters that go through hell and back for each other while just deliver just an overall great experience I would recommend Golden Wind.
                              THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS
                              I loved it. By far my favorite Jojo's Bizarre Adventure story yet. 
                              I love JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. It's probably my favorite anime and manga series of all time. This is going to be a biased review written by someone who's loved this story for a long time already. I knew before going into this anime that it would be good. David Production has yet to poorly adapt any of Hirohiko Araki's stellar manga series and Golden Wind is their best work to date. Golden Wind is the best adapted part of JoJo's. It elevates an already amazing story into something truly unforgettable. I loved everything about it.
                              A near perfect action adventure superhero/fantasy anime. The soundtrack is straight up bomb, there is a reason it is used so often in memes and videos. There's no shortage of epic ""cliche"" anime moments that will make u stand up in your seat, and its hella action packed so you won't be bored a minute. The music and action scenes just synergize together so perfectly to create hype and excitement for the audience. Each episode is just bursting with plot twists, explosive moments, confusion, and epic acts of heroism.  The acting is perfect, the music is perfect, and the story while simple is actually          
                              This is one of the best anime's i have ever seen this anime is very creative due to the amount of stands and how each of them have unique abilities and the characters are also very unique besides carne since that dude looks mad weird and pesci but he kinda had his moment so yeah. but Giorno is a very good character in my opinion since he has a dream and he keeps maturing as the story moves on and diavolo is a good villian since he has a very powerful stand and he has very strong motives. The side characters are really good my          
                              Let me just start by saying this was far and away the worst part of jojo yet and I wasn't a huge fan of the first two parts. We’ve reached the end and I still don’t have a good understanding of what the characters goals were. Let’s just jump into the story and get this shit behind us and look forward to Jolyne. 
                              There are a lot of reasons why i love JoJo,
                              The last animated part at the time of this review. Now we leave Japan again to find ourselves in 21st century Italy, with mafias and Stand users loose in the streets. This part takes character development to an extreme, where the protagonist is the entire crew.",61
63,"One autumn evening at a mysterious ramen stand behind the Shimogamo Shrine, a lonely third-year college student bumps into a man with an eggplant-shaped head who calls himself a god of matrimony. Meeting this man causes the student to reflect upon his past two years at college—two years bitterly spent trying to break up couples on campus with his only friend Ozu, a ghoulish-looking man seemingly set on making his life as miserable as possible. Resolving to make the most out of the rest of his college life, the student attempts to ask out the unsociable but kind-hearted underclassman Akashi, yet fails to follow through, prompting him to regret not living out his college life differently. As soon as this thought passes through his head, however, he is hurtled through time and space to the beginning of his years at college and given another chance to live his life.

Surreal, artistic, and mind-bending, Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei chronicles the misadventures of a young man on a journey to make friends, find love, and experience the rose-colored campus life he always dreamed of.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.61,8,64,457,310345,14456,"                              I don't mean to get deep and definitely not right off the bat, but it's pretty true that small events can change the course of your life whether you're aware or not and that is what Yojou-han Shinwa Taikei (or the 4.5 Tatami Mat Galaxy) is all about. Sure it's also about pleasing your Johnny, hijacking blimps, engaging in prank wars, being ripped off by fortune tellers, joining the local power ranger squad, and eating cats and castella, but that's all trivial. Brought to you by the same guy who brought you Mind Game, Cat Soup, and Kaiba, Masaaki Yuasa, brings you what I would          
                              I watched Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei back in 2011. I was a noob and thought it was a masterpiece and the best thing ever. Recently, I rewatched it and came to realize that it was just the wannabe-elitist in me thinking this show is any good. It's basically the same as Sword Art Online, just the other end of the same shit-stick. 
                              Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei (or The Tatami Galaxy) is an anime about a university student stuck in a Groundhog Day-esque time loop. In the span of each episode, our nameless main character (he is referred to as Watashi, basically meaning ""myself"") goes over the same two years of university, unaware of the loop, each time joining a different club, in search of a ""rose-coloured campus life"".
                              I think I'm not in the wrong here when I say most of us have probably thought of the best way to live life at one time or another. That can mean what you want to be when you grow up, your dreams, ambitions, goals, what path you want to take, and what you envision it ending up life.
                              J. D. Salinger's ""The Catcher in the Rye"" despite being a novel intended for adults, in many ways laid the groundworks for the typical young adult story, where an above average intelligent teen tells about their life and problems, in a very self-conscious, humorously wanna-be literate way. Examples range from the now aging Adrian Mole books, to mostly anything by John Green, and the recent British film ""Submarine"". Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei, or Tatami Galaxy, is also a rendition of this trope, though seemingly with a pinch of some hallucinogenic drug.
                              From time to time, I desire a show that will deliver a simple and grounded in reality plot in an unorthodox way with great success. Yes, you should already understand that Tatami Galaxy holds no need for superficial or amazing concepts to be successful, just a realistic story executed in a masterful way.
                              Beware, spoiler-ish review.
                              **SPOILER FREE REVIEW**
                              I decided to watch ""Tatami Galaxy"" because of the overwhelming numbers of positive reviews, many giving it a perfect 10/10.
                              When you look back on your life up until now, do you find yourself feeling somewhat dissatisfied with how things have turned out? Do you find yourself regretting choices you’ve made, the people you’ve met and end up wishing you could just give it another shot, knowing that this time around, everything would work out so much better for you?
                               There isn’t much to Tatami Galaxy. A nameless protagonist, here by referred to as Watashi, wants another chance at a “rose colored campus life with a raven haired maiden”. Through mystical means he is granted the opportunity to do so, thus beginning his journey for that rose colored campus life he so desperately wants though it might just be right in front of him. With such a setup there are not many places to go, and Tatami Galaxy quickly finds itself trapped. 
                              If there was ever a time to slow clap it out, this would be the precise time to.
                              The choices you make might change, but the end result will always be the same.
                              The idea of perfection is something that, I believe, not any piece of media has been able to attain, and that makes sense. Nothing is 'truly perfect' and every piece of media, no matter how great that product actually is, will still have flaws in one way or another and this philosophy also applies when I give tens to shows. When I do so, I don't reward an anime a ten because I believe it is perfect. I reward a ten to an anime that does the most good or is a shining example of what the medium is capable of. The Tatami Galaxy is          
                              ""This opportunity is always dangling in front of your eyes. You must grab this opportunity and act on it. And if you not, you will walk this life as now, ever unchanging."" For starters, the opportunity would be this anime, and you shouldn't miss it, as it will impact your life, just as the quote suggests.",63
64,"Natsume Yuujinchou San follows Takashi Natsume, a boy who is able to see youkai. Natsume and his bodyguard Madara, nicknamed Nyanko-sensei, continue on their quest to release youkai from their contracts in the ""Book of Friends.""

Natsume comes to terms with his ability to see youkai and stops thinking of it as a curse. As he spends more time with his human and youkai friends, he realizes how much he values them both and decides he doesn't have to choose between the spirit and human worlds to be happy.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.6,8,65,743,201504,1295,"                              NOTE: Since the content in all three seasons is similar enough that they don't warrant separate reviews, they will all be covered here. The fourth will be edited in when it finishes, unless it differs heavily from the first three by the end of its run.
                              Although many believe a happy ending is most often times not a ""good ending"" I would beg to differ. In this season, Natsume not only presses towards the future, but shows flashbacks of the past. I was thrilled to see more of Natsume's past because it enabled me to fill some of the mysteries behind his past. 
                              Natsume Yuujinchou’s presentation style is distinctly episodic, meaning that the external conflicts in themselves don’t add up to much. However, there remains a strong undercurrent of Natsume’s character development throughout as he grows from being a lonely boy to a self-assured young man. As such, what makes the viewing experience so worthwhile is the subtle touch of delicate dilemmas and enchanting atmospheres.
                              Natsume Yuujinchou San shows the continuation of Natsume and nyanko sensei's adventures.
                              ""Right now, humans and youkai are equally irreplaceable to me.""
                              If you were to summarize Natsume Yuujinchou San in one word it would be boring. After the first couple of episodes you have basically watched them all as Natsume Yuujinchou San is repetitiveness in its purest form. 
                              Natsume yuujinchou san, the third installment of the beloved series, brings the same lightheartedness and melancholy known throughout the series. 
                              -Kon’nichiwa Mina-san!! Have you already watched Natsume Yuujicnhou by Yuki Midorikawa-sama? This anime will give you a refreshing feeling that is rare to find, some says that you can compare it to Mushishi. Well talking about that is another story.Talking about our main review Natsume Yuujinchou is about the boy named natsume Takashi an adopted child of the childless but kind couple Touku and Shirugen Furijawa and also about the sadness and the longing for someone to understand him despite of his ability to see and communicate with the Ayakashi or Yokai as they said. And as the days go by he started to learn          
                              After waiting two seemingly very long years, a sequel is finally here. Oh! I genuinely miss this series. Though, at the beginning they will explain it a little bit but still you wouldn’t understand it much less appreciates how great this series is if you haven’t seen the previous seasons.
                               this 3rd season of Natsume Yuujinchou i is where I think the series truly begins to Shine, the first two seasons are all about Natsume's enounters with various youkai's as he gives back their name, and learn something new in life.
                              This season finally gave me what I was looking for from this anime, and I'm so happy it did because it was amazing.
                              We continue to view the journey of Takeshi Natsume, an orphaned teenage boy with the ability to communicate with spirits (not dead people?).",64
71,"The aloof protagonist: a bookworm who is deeply detached from the world he resides in. He has no interest in others and is firmly convinced that nobody has any interest in him either. His story begins when he stumbles across a handwritten book, titled ""Living with Dying."" He soon identifies it as a secret diary belonging to his popular, bubbly classmate Sakura Yamauchi. She then confides in him about the pancreatic disease she is suffering from and that her time left is finite. Only her family knows about her terminal illness; not even her best friends are aware. Despite this revelation, he shows zero sympathy for her plight, but caught in the waves of Sakura's persistent buoyancy, he eventually concedes to accompanying her for her remaining days.

As the pair of polar opposites interact, their connection strengthens, interweaving through their choices made with each passing day. Her apparent nonchalance and unpredictability disrupts the protagonist's impassive flow of life, gradually opening his heart as he discovers and embraces the true meaning of living.

I loved this movie, and I cried my eyes out. The reason people love tearjerkers is because people want to be moved. We want to experience something that will truly take us away from our lives and make us feel something so strong that we are moved to tears. This movie did just that. In an effort to avoid spoiling anything for anyone, I won’t write about the climax and ending, but it was unexpected. That said, I couldn’t imagine it ending any

                              THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS.
                              ""I Want to Eat Your Pancreas"" is one of the worst excuses for a movie I have ever seen! 
                              Kimi no Suizou wo Tabetai, also known by the English title ""I want to eat your pancreas"", is a drama anime film with tragedy. It is about an outgoing girl who has a pancreatic illness which she has not told anyone except her family that she has this illness. A boy from her class stumbles upon her diary that she left in the hospital and she comes back to fetch the diary only to realise that he read it so she ends up telling him about her illness. Due to this secret knowledge of theirs that none of their classmates know about, they start to          
                              See you can make a memorable modern movie if you want too Japan! Made by a studio who nobody even heard about it ""I want to eat your pancreas"" is a rare gem that everyone must see! Like Frank Sinatra's song ""Strangers in the Night"" I too was a stranger before coming across this movie. This movie is a letter of love addressed to life who despite being short is damn gorgeous!
                              I enjoy clichéd, predictable tearjerkers as much as the next person (honestly, I do), but not like this. Kimi no Suizou wo Tabetai chooses to explore how we live out our relationships with others in the face of death, and does so by presenting a questionable relationship in the first place.
                              I have never given my opinion about anything in MAL. But honestly, I had to make an exception here.
                              This review vaguely goes over themes discussed at later points in the film. Read with caution.
                              I decided to watch this Movie in the split second that nearly made me miss the last bus that would make me arrive at the cinema on time. 
                              What will you do if you know that you are going to die in one year? Of course, most people definitely want to live their life to the fullest, fulfilling anything they want, going to places that is impossible to go, or maybe devoting themselves to a spiritual journey in the name of God. This anime film definitely will reminded you of death that eventually come to us whether you like it or not, how you should leave your mark in this world and how it could change other person to a better one. Having the most misleading title I have ever heard, I Want          
                              This Is my first time writing a review. 
                              I've gotta say just one thing to start off with, watch this. sit down, don't get distracted, don't stop/pause it in the middle for a bathroom/popcorn/snack/smartphone break... pick some time where you WON'T be interrupted what so ever. this movie is excellent. I've no clue what the novel or it's manga is like; but as a stand alone movie this one SERIOUSLY ties my #1 choices up in knots. 'Kimi no Na wa.' WAS my singular #1 anime movie ever. but now I think I've got two. 
                              Terrible.
                              I recently watched this and toward the end, I felt strongly about how *bad* it got near the end and had to write my thoughts down about it. But before I begin...",71

                              In case fans of Gintama want to know what The Semi-Final is, it basically adapts a few chapters that took place between episode 367 and The Final that weren't gonna fit/didn't blend well with the story in the final film. It's a direct pickup from episode 367, so it does feel a bit weird to watch these two episodes, but it probably would feel nicer to watch if you watch this right after episode 367.",75

Furthermore, dealing with the formidable twin Miya brothers only makes things more difficult for Karasuno.

As soon as the match begins, Karasuno is overwhelmed by all the noise and jeers from the supporters of Inarizaki High but rekindles its strength thanks to its own loyal fans. Karasuno also gains some momentum by utilizing an attack centered on Shouyou Hinata, but the eccentric play of Atsumu and Osamu Miya delivers an unexpected blow that leaves their opponent astounded.

Things are bound to get intense as the match progresses between these two teams. Will Karasuno be able to defeat Inarizaki High and overcome the hurdles that threaten its pursuit to the top?

Im a swimmer, so youd think I would be able to relate to Free! more than Haikyuu. Nope. Haikyuu is every bit as relateable and motivational for me as a swimmer than free couldve been. Which is why i favor haikyuu over free. Now without further ado, lets get into my review.
                              Story : outstanding!! the storyline is just AMAZING, it's very inspirational, funny, cheerfull, and emotional. boring and overused? NAH original? ABSOLUTELY YES
                              My fav anime of all time. I'm so glad that I am alive to watch this anime I mean it's jst a masterpiece 🥺 and I'm so proud of hinata. My baby have improved so much and I can't wait to see the next season (karasuno vs nekoma). Also I hope they animate msby black jackals match too. 
                              Haikyuu!! To The Top 2nd season did not disappoint. It was real Haikyuu. And Haikyuu is absolutely incredible.
                              I mean, I knew what was gonna happen, but it was funny and awesome anyway.
                              To The Top season 1 was already pretty bad, but I held out knowing that season 2 would have more volleyball. Then To the Top season 2 came out... utterly gormless. It pains me to say, as someone who really enjoyed the whole series up until To the Top, but what little enjoyment I got was from laughing at it and laughing at how bad it was. Personally, the two main issues were the story/characters and the art. ",76
89,"Inspired after watching a volleyball ace nicknamed ""Little Giant"" in action, small-statured Shouyou Hinata revives the volleyball club at his middle school. The newly-formed team even makes it to a tournament; however, their first match turns out to be their last when they are brutally squashed by the ""King of the Court,"" Tobio Kageyama. Hinata vows to surpass Kageyama, and so after graduating from middle school, he joins Karasuno High School's volleyball team—only to find that his sworn rival, Kageyama, is now his teammate.

Thanks to his short height, Hinata struggles to find his role on the team, even with his superior jumping power. Surprisingly, Kageyama has his own problems that only Hinata can help with, and learning to work together appears to be the only way for the team to be successful. Based on Haruichi Furudate's popular shounen manga of the same name, Haikyuu!! is an exhilarating and emotional sports comedy following two determined athletes as they attempt to patch a heated rivalry in order to make their high school volleyball team the best in Japan.

                              So if you can tell from my score, I really freaking love this anime.  I have to preface this by saying, I am NOT a sports anime fan. It's one of the last genres I look to because I've disliked/dropped over 90% of the ones I've seen. So I'm incredibly biased.
                              The most important thing in a team sports is, without a doubt, the team. This holds especially true for volleyball. Having six talented players is all fine, but as long as they aren’t a team and don’t show team spirit, that talent is surely in vain. But what if it’s the other way round; is it a surefire way to win when you have one team where not everyone is talented?
                              “So long as I am here, you will be the strongest” – Tobio Kageyama 
                              There’s a phrase that goes “dynamite come in little packages”. The meaning implies that someone who is small can achieve big accomplishments. Shoyo Hinata, the protagonist of the series is a perfect example of this. Standing no more than 6 feet tall but yet has a big heart, Hinata is someone filled with integrity. Witness the extraordinary journey that Hinata undertakes to prove the whole world his worth as a volleyball player. And believe me, it’s worth it especially when it’s someone named the “Ultimate Decoy”. 
                              Bring on season 2.
                              I just want to start this by saying i have never seen a sports anime before, this is my first step into the genre, and i've heard this show has a lot going for it, it isn't reliant on fan service like others, it has a rich story and unique characters, and it has a killer art style. Sadly i would say only 2 of those things are true, the killer art style and it not being reliant on fan service. 
                              Teamwork. Talent. Hardwork. Winning. Losing.
                              I had wanted to see Haikyuu for a while and I was so surprised at how much I liked it. I knew I would like it but not the 'I'm going to marathon the entire thing in one night' type of like. 
                              I think this anime series had a perfect mix of it all.
                              Wow... I was never really planning on writing a review on MAL, but I just feel compelled to share my thoughts on this breathtaking anime.
                              Alright, I'm going to preface this review by saying that this will for the most part be subjective, with only my final comments justifying why I believe Haikyuu is a 10. 
                              Haikyuu is a volleyball anime that tells a story of a not-gifted-in-terms-of-height freshmen high school student named Hinata Shoyo, who dreams to become the next ""little giant"" in volleyball. 
                              God awful show. Im just bewildred how can people actually like this and find this trash enjoyable? Story was the worst i've ever seen in my entire anime career, volleyball is boring enough on its own but im jsut so suprised that Haruichi (creator) found out a way to make it even more boring! I will give props to the animation it does the best it can to make a terrible show into a barely watchable show. The OPs are garbage and the same goes for the endings not even the soundtrack or the character voices are decent everything is just a mess of the

90,"Hanamichi Sakuragi, infamous for his temper, massive height, and fire-red hair, enrolls in Shohoku High, hoping to finally get a girlfriend and break his record of being rejected 50 consecutive times in middle school. His notoriety precedes him, however, leading to him being avoided by most students. Soon, after certain events, Hanamichi is left with two unwavering thoughts: ""I hate basketball,"" and ""I desperately need a girlfriend.""

One day, a girl named Haruko Akagi approaches him without any knowledge of his troublemaking ways and asks him if he likes basketball. Hanamichi immediately falls head over heels in love with her, blurting out a fervent affirmative. She then leads him to the gymnasium, where she asks him if he can do a slam dunk. In an attempt to impress Haruko, he makes the leap, but overshoots, instead slamming his head straight into the blackboard. When Haruko informs the basketball team's captain of Hanamichi's near-inhuman physical capabilities, he slowly finds himself drawn into the camaraderie and competition of the sport he had previously held resentment for.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.53,8,93,728,203240,5539,"                              Slam Dunk is one of those classics of sports anime.  You always hear about it and wonder if it actually is the best thing since sliced bread.  Well, it isn't.  But it is funny and entertaining and worthwhile if you have the patience for it.
                              This anime has almost everything. Action, comedy, tragedy, romantic tensions, manly moments, etc. The cast is pretty huge and when possible, each character or group gets their chance to shine. A great percentage of the characters each contribute something to the advancement of the story and/or get their moment in the sun so. It doesn’t have to be Sakuragi, or the rest of the Shohoku team. Even Sakuragi’s gang gets their chance to do something every now and then. 
                              Slam Dunk is considered a pioneer of sports anime. All from its witty jokes to its inspiring speeches, it’s a masterpiece from the 90s. It teaches many valuable morals of life such as establishing strong bonds with each other, and to never give up. It’s an anime that’s been a part of my childhood, and I knew from its first episode that it would be hilarious. 
                              Slam dunk is, in my opinion, the best anime i've seen.
                              Slam Dunk! Is a sports comedy anime telling a story of a school basketball team and a newcomer Sakuragi Hanamichi, who basicly joins the club just to get the attention of a girl after being dumped by girls way too many times in the past. And as you might guess, Sakuragi then truly gets interested in basketball after hard training and finding himself - what a surprise - a rival in both basketball and girl attention aspects. The story itself is pretty decent, maybe a bit too predictable though. The animation and sounds (music, voice actors etc.) in this anime is average, considering the fact          
                              For a anime to be called Slam Dunk one of the most flashy, epic, move that blows away anyone watching, to then be so tedious and incomplete that I would have dropped it from the start. 
                              Slam Dunk, the first thing it'd tell me is Basketball! :) i've been playing bball for sometime now, and this anime was out just before i was born:) 
                              One of my favourite animes since I was around 7 years old. It's hilarious, has the perfect amount of drama, comedy, suspense and action (in it's own rights). Always love re-watching and re-re-watching episodes whenever I'm bored. 
                              Instead of writing a paragraph of review, I will basically list all the good things I thought abou tthis show:
                              Slam dunk is one of the anime which is pretty well known. In my opinion this anime is over hyped with no content to support it. First the story, the story in itself feels a little dull. I said dull because in over hundered episode the story could have been amazing. I will not spoil the story, but trust me this anime have a little content for a 101 episode anime. The matches are long ( episode wise), smallest match I ever seen in this anime was 5 episode long. You feel bored in half way through the anime. The character development feels well paced          
                              Slam Dunk is probably one of the most beautiful sports anime I have ever come acrossed. It is one of those animes that will be forever be memorable once you have watched it.
                              I'm a little biased, this is my favorite anime/manga of all time. And as it turns out, not just mine. Slam Dunk has been voted as being Japan's favorite manga of all time. Takehiko Inoue is also one of the most revered and acknowledged mangaka ever. Following Slam Dunk, he has created several other masterpieces, namely Vagabond which I haven't read yet. But apparently it has received some very distinguished awards. But regarding Slam Dunk, it's not like Kuroko where the characters are dramatized by the color of their hair, by special abilities only relevant in sci fi. It's a lot more realistic, and the          
                              To me, Slam Dunk was one of the anime I used to watch as a kid on AXN. It is about the national Shohoku basketball team developing their relationships as well as their fitness levels. This anime says that basketball really comes in all sorts of tricks and I like the way how they dribble the ball and throw the ball into the net. The net gives the score.

                              This anime is straight 10 in every aspects for me. I had watched first time when I was 6 six years old with its limited episodes on TV. Slam Dunk is the reason why I started playing basketball and loved that sport so much. It increases popularity of basket not only in Japan but in other countries. ",90
92,"Japan, 1955: Mario Minakami has just arrived at Shounan Special Reform School along with five other teenagers who have been arrested on serious criminal charges. All assigned to the same cell, they meet older inmate Rokurouta Sakuragi—a former boxer—with whom they establish a close bond. Under his guidance, and with the promise that they will meet again on the outside after serving their sentences, the delinquents begin to view their hopeless situation in a better light.

Rainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin follows the seven cellmates as they struggle together against the brutal suffering and humiliation inflicted upon them by Ishihara, a sadistic guard with a grudge on Rokurouta, and Gisuke Sasaki, a doctor who takes pleasure in violating boys. Facing such hellish conditions, the seven inmates must scrape together all the strength they have to survive until their sentences are up; but even if they do, just what kind of lives are waiting for them on the other side?

                              What exactly is friendship? Are your friends more important to you than your family? What are you willing to go through for a friend? Rainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin (for the rest of the review the anime will be referred to simply as Rainbow) focuses on friendship, as well as several other themes based around friendship, such as humanity, morality, violence, love, family etc. This is my review:
                              Rainbow : Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin - after watching episodes of this anime, one word kept coming to my mind. ""Beautiful"". This anime shows how beautiful friendship can be. Acts of selflessness, sacrificing oneself to help another, returning to that one special place - It's all present in Rainbow. It's a good mix of emotion, struggle and drama. Rainbow is one superb anime, regrettably, it's buried deep within the other numerous popular titles out there and I'm glad I found it(more like stumbled upon).
                              'RAINBOW - The Seven from Cell 2-6' is about seven teens who spent time in same cell of Shounan Disciplinary School after committing separate juvenile crimes in 1955.
                              Rainbow starts off fine with an interesting concept (boys from post WWII) but this show could have been so much more if they really stuck to that principle. As stated early on, the author wanted to emphasize the coolness of his characters, and given that, it shows in how little this anime develops anything else.
                              Overview:
                              ""No matter how tired you are, or how much punishment you take, look into his eyes. Never look down.""
                              ""Most people are prisoners, thinking only about the future or living in the past. They are not in the present, and the present is where everything begins."" - Carlos Santana.
                              Friendship is an extremely common theme in anime (in any medium for that matter) but rarely is it portrayed in hell. Set in a crippled 1950's Japan, Rainbow thrusts its seven protagonists into a juvenile refinement center, which is essentially a youth prison filled with guards who are out for blood. They give each other nicknames, befriend each other over a smoke, and carve their dreams on a tree for when they're finally free, and agree to meet there once again in the future.
                              The problem with ourselves right now is we usually too arrogant and easily judged anime just by seeing the cover. Without watching or see it, we can easily bashed and even judge the anime before even giving it a shot. Many covers in anime sometimes didnt really represent on whats gonna happen in the anime itself, Like Rainbow : Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin.
                              THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS!
                              Rainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin. This anime goes into the dark theme of seven teenagers forced to suffer for their crimes in a detention facility just after the WWII. The story follows these seven teenagers in trying to survive the cruelty of the warden and the detention center in general. The story progression may be a bit slow at times but it surely delivers. Story: 8/10

                              In the aftermath of the most devastating war in history, inside a reformatory, an unbreakable friendship is born between seven children.
                              Another beautiful anime. Rainbow is truly an underrated gem that I happen to stumble upon and I was really amazed of how well everything is made in this anime and how well it showed the values of love, friendship and hope is very important in life.",92

                              Many who watched this series have missed the point of it, it isn't like the original, no it wasn't supposed to surpass it like many suspected here. It is here to complete it, you may have not noticed but the original had many things that we had yet to see. This isn't a what if story either, this is the story of Okabe who failed to find Steins Gate, the same one who fell under depression because of it.
                              There comes a time when fans of a franchise should ask themselves if an established franchise deserves a sequel or not. Let’s face it. Steins;Gate made an impact back in 2011 when it became one of the critically acclaimed adaptations that year. Visuals novels aren’t easy to adapt and in fact, most recent series really proved themselves to be a catastrophe in that territory. Steins;Gate is one of those properties that didn’t really need a sequel although fans have been asking for years. And it’s a bit painful for me to say….but Steins;Gate 0 didn’t truly live up to the name it made for itself.

                              The term ""peak fiction"" often gets thrown around and has somewhat lost its meaning these days. Peak fiction, for me, is something that exemplifies masterful storytelling, world building and well written characters. The best of the best. The zenith of storytelling. Only a few series I've ever read/seen have reached those heights. Re:Zero is one of them and is in indeed, peak fiction.

                              Finally, the preliminary round has ended as the final episode just finished airing. What you see now is the updated and final version of my season 2 part 1 review, as promised.
                              Four years ago, Re:Zero took the world by storm with its fresh and innovative take on the isekai genre, and it rekindled my passion for the anime industry. Now in 2020, a year plagued with disaster and disappointment for many, it has returned with a much appreciated sequel. Amidst the cancellation and delay of a plethora of anime as well as the release of a slew of rather underwhelming others, it was refreshing to tune in to Re:Zero each week to follow its engaging narrative and compelling cast. 
                              Few shows in recent memory have been the center of as much controversy as Re:ZERO. While one side claims it to be an indisputable masterpiece, basing themselves on arguments like “Subaru’s realism” and the “deconstruction of the isekai genre”, the other is often of the opinion that it’s more spectacle than substance, repetitive shlock that often relies on shock factor more than anything. This division combined with 2016’s infamous “best girl” discourse has served to turn people off from any future installments of the series, and perhaps few can blame them for that.

Whether you’re among the uncontrollable super-fans who’ve adored Re:Zero for the last four years or among its haters who’ve vehemently despised it for just as long and decried it with just as much fervor, I bet there was never a time when you were in the opposing camp, and while I suppose my position isn’t quite so polarizing, it’s definitely an awkward middle-ground of its own. What’s worse is the fact my opinions on the show as I knew it were

This is the question posed by Berserk, pitting humanistic free will against nihilistic predestination.  More intimately, this is the battle of human suffering in the wake of divine fate and the ambition of one's fellow man.  Set in a medieval world of strife, vast green lands and blue skies obscure the supernatural demonic powers lurking in unseen shadows.  One man named Griffith, graceful leader of the notorious mercenary group Band of the Hawk, stakes everything on a fate he means to forge for himself at any cost, and as he shines ever brighter the shadows nearby

                              Story: 10/10 Did you get the meat for my dog, boy!?
                              JUST a masterpiece ! A superb balance of everything! I don;t have the words to describe it! Everything is perfect - from the animation, through the marvellous soundtrack (a excellent work from Susumu HIRASAWA - Paranoia Agent, Paprika - just can\'t describe the emotional feeling from the music ) and finally to the magnificent story!
                              SUPPOSING that Griffith did nothing wrong — what then?  
                              You wondered why people overuse the word, “Epic” for anything and everything in the world, no matter how mundane and pointless it really is. This is especially the case in anime, as when people tell me to watch this show and how epic it is, I just don’t feel it and there is also the fact that I might’ve been underwhelmed by it and people seem to look at me weird by that. However, I knew about this anime by this time the newer Berserk movies were coming out and the fact that I listened to the DREAMcast episode 20 about Berserk, which was the          
                              Berserk is one of the best series I've ever seen, in a different league than most anime, which are too often filled with  pointless, arrogant ideals shouted by quasi-female, one-dimensional characters in dire need of a haircut.
                              It's amusing to look back at my first impressions after episode 1 of Berserk. I laughed at how corny the level of viol­ence was, gig­gled at the demons’ con­stant ref­er­ences to the tear­ing of flesh and crunch­ing of bones. The rest of the series was noth­ing like that first epis­ode. Totally dif­fer­ent in terms of tone, dir­ec­tion and pur­pose. And yet, in the grand story of Ber­serk, was every bit as import­ant as any other epis­ode in the rest of the series.
                              Fatigued, broken and injured, the remnants of The Band of The Hawk make haste after their once powerful and great leader; a shell of his former self. This man's dreams, hopes and work are all hopelessly destroyed, and, as he calls out for salvation, the sky is adorned with a deep, dark red tint that masks the entire area in the colour of blood. Bone-chilling laughter fills the cold, stifling air, as the mere mortals look on in despair at the grotesque and horrifying beasts before them. The eclipse has begun...
                              I think everyone who has saw this anime would come to the same conclusion, it is a masterpiece. 
                              Personally, I think this is just an advertisement for the manga, but for all the right reasons. Yes, I will acknowledge that it ends at a bad place but there are reasons for that. First off, when the anime ended, it was technically caught up with the manga so they really couldn&rsquo;t continue yet, but the bad news is, the anime still cuts out a lot and I felt they really rushed things through, but still covers the central basics with the characters and themes. I say what really brings people into the anime outside of the action is definitely the themes this anime has          
                              It's bad anime. It is below averange level for grown-up people.
                              Epic storytelling comes in different forms to guarantee that it can achieve its goal of telling an intriguing story filled with plenty of mythology around it. In the realm of high fantasy, there are enough to go around these days. However, it does not often happen to come across a series that wants to create an intriguing, tragic tale of betrayal and fate, but also tries to appeal to the action crowd with blood inducing carnage. In which case, Berserk fits perfectly with this description in with good precision.
                              What follows after is unknown, but what came before is a tale of friendship and of camaraderie. It is a tale of hardship and of sacrifice, fuelled by the pursuit of one man's dream. Unfortunately, it's a tale without a proper conclusion. You ever watched something that had you completely engrossed with what was going on and then RIGHT when it gets to the most soul-crushing and depressing part, it suddenly ends? No? Well too fucking bad. That's what the deal is with Berserk. This is my third time watching the anime, and even though I've forgiven virtually EVERYTHING else that was wrong with this          
                              Now, you may or may not be able to tell by looking at this show that it’s about as ugly and grizzled as its demon villains. The animation is bare-bones in this show, absolutely putrid sometimes, and guess what? I almost don’t care, because the story is an absolute masterpiece. Equal parts political intrigue and fantastical nightmare, it sucks you in like few stories can. If I may be hoity-toity for a moment, it reminds me of the great Greek tragedies and blood-stained Roman myths where grandiose characters with small tragic flaws would be lifted to the heights of great godhood before inevitably crashing down          ",101

Sadly, all good things must come to an end, and CHAM! must see one of its members, Mima Kirigoe, leave the group to pursue her acting career. While Mima's choice is met with a mixed response, she hopes her fans will continue to support her.

However, Mima's life begins to change drastically after her departure from the group. Wanting to shed her pop-idol image, she takes on a role in a crime drama series, and her career as an actress gradually becomes more demanding and taxing for both Mima and her manager, Rumi Hidaka. To add to Mima's growing unease, an obsessed fan who is incapable of accepting that Mima has quit being an innocent idol, begins stalking her; a new anonymous website begins to impersonate her life with intricate detail; and CHAM! also appears to be doing better without her. One by one, each disturbing development drives Mima to become increasingly unhinged and unable to distinguish reality from fantasy.

                              Sitting alone in the dark watching someone tell the day you had forgotten. You just might lose your mind.
                              Perfect Blue centers around a small pop star's transition into the film business.  Her life is turned upside down by her new, less innocent work, a stalker, and several murders that occur around her.  Much like Millennium Actress and Paprika, this is another Satoshi Kon film that blurs the lines between reality and delusion, only to a more suspenseful effect in Perfect Blue.  Mima, the ex-pop star turned actress is filming a TV murder drama throughout most of the movie that eerily mirrors the murders that are occurring around her.  It is often unclear if a scene is playing out on          
                              I'm a big Kon fan, i love Milennium Actress and Paprika.
                              Anyone familiar with Satoshi Kon is probably also already familiar with what would make this movie intriguing. His works have a real appeal to fans of the surreal. It can be very mentally and visually stimulating. I've enjoyed other things by Kon, and I was really beginning to like this movie, however, by the end I had several problems with this film...
                              Why is it that I always end up watching movies like this at 4 am, in my room, alone?

                              There's a reason why this movie is called Perfect Blue. ""Perfect"" because the movie itself is a masterpiece and ""Blue"" because it is truly a dementia that will make you fall into despondent of figuring out what's actually happening.

Behind this there is a lot of hard work involved, and suddenly quitting being an idol can have an emotional impact upon the fans, which can lead to jealousy and contempt, or even murder.

Make no mistake, it’s been on my radar for over a decade but I’ve often felt intimidated by the premise of this film, not feeling up to the challenge. But as with all good things, they come to those who wait and since I have Perfect Blue on Blu-ray and was well in the mood to watch it, finally maturing I finally thought that tonight was as good as any to pop it in and give it a spin…and boy          ",104
109,Third season of Golden Kamuy.,8.46,8,119,1706,78006,593,"                              AHHH...Golden Kamuy, the series that never stops giving both its world and characters rest (even with the ample amounts strewn throughout), and keeping us on our toes each and every time. Now into the 3rd season after a 2-year wait, and the ""peak fiction"" levels of enjoyment and thrill has never dipped once, even with its hilarious slice-of-life comedy that always proclaims the provocatively memorable ""HINNA, HINNA!"" catchphrase. If you're reading this review and watching this spectacular series for the very first time (at least this installment anyways), please start from the very beginning and experience the awesomeness that is this historical action-adventure series that's          
                              Honestly Golden Kamuy is the best anime of this season for me.Season 3 was hype and it sure deliver the hype more than i expected.
                              Another great season of a criminally under-watched anime.
                              GOLDEN KAMUY NEVER DISAPPOINTS
                              How the F*CK do you get people to watch Golden Kamuy?
                              Golden Kamuy is one of those animes that gets better and better by each season. The surprising part is that it started great from the very beginning and it has never lost its steam since then. The ending of the last season was one of the highlights of the series to that point, and yet, I had some doubts after the reconfiguration of the parties we follow in this part, how the story will work when you separate Sugimoto and Asirpa, one of the strongest features of the series? to my surprise (and ignorance), it worked extremely well, so I was happy to be rightfully          
                              Third season of golden Kamuy and I love how the animation level is maintained and all the feeling it transmits. Very nice apart we have a very nice and good reunion. The season is good because you see more pasts of the protagonist's father and you better understand who he is because he happens. And what will happen? I look forward to season 4.
                              Let me start off with saying: Golden Kamuy is just getting better and Better and BETTER! This show is such an underrated anime that deserves more credit and needs to be watched by weebs more.
                              For all intents and purposes, I didn’t expect a piss joke to be the thing in this season that got me cracking up the most. Now, I’m not against it or anything, but in a show about war, ethnic minorities, history, and a surprising amount of gay overtones, ‘urine’ was not the thing I was expecting to get me bursting this time around. (Pun not intended)
                              God Golden Kamuy does nothing but gets better and better!
                              Another great season of Golden Kamuy! Let's get right into the anime basics.
                              I think at begging it's hard to recognize Golden Kamuy as a great anime, when the series does not appears to be taken seriously... But, just wait untill watch more few episodes to start rethinking that!
                              I legitimately have no idea how this season has more score than the first two, I don't even know how this get more than 7 stars with just dumbly chasing for 11 episodes and just let the trouble ran away in the last episode, except more people are free this year so the standard was lower.
                              What can I say except, woow with rapid hand-clapping 
                              Simply it's a great anime, one of the best..",109
111,"Nana Komatsu is a helpless, naïve 20-year-old who easily falls in love and becomes dependent and clingy to those around her. Even though she nurses ambitious dreams of removing herself from her provincial roots and finding her true calling, she ends up traveling to Tokyo with the humble reason of chasing her current boyfriend Shouji Endo.

Nana Osaki, on the other hand, is a proud, enigmatic punk rock vocalist from a similarly rural background, who nurtures the desire to become a professional singer. Putting her career with a fairly popular band (and her passionate romance with one of its former members) firmly behind her, she boards the same train to Tokyo as Nana Komatsu.

Through a fateful encounter in their journey toward the metropolis, the young women with the same given name are brought together, sparking a chain of events which eventually result in them sharing an apartment. As their friendship deepens, the two attempt to support each other through thick and thin, their deeply intertwined lives filled with romance, music, challenges, and heartbreaks that will ultimately test their seemingly unbreakable bond.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.46,8,121,330,408105,17166,"                              One of the things I like to see the most in anime is how they portray relationships. I&rsquo;m a sucker for romance, but I hate the cheesy stuff you usually see in typical shoujo anime. Sometimes you&rsquo;ll find an anime with realistic characters, with the typical flaws of human nature, and usually people love them. We can identify with them. Like in Evangelion many people who have dealt with depression could identify with Shinji (in some levels&hellip;). 
                              Nana is one of those acclaimed anime that everyone seems to know the existence of, but very few people have ever actually watched. The fact that it’s almost 50 episodes long is a bit of a turn-off in of itself, but even the people who have seen it barely discuss the thing anymore. Very few “favorite anime” lists that I’ve read actually include it. It’s up there with Great Teacher Onizuka, Hajime no Ippo, and most of the Major anime in terms of high-ranking MAL darlings that the majority of MAL users will go “oh yeah, I’ve heard how good this thing is. Better put          
                              The background of NANA feels like an endless white night. Things seem to be continuously in motion; beginnings and endings wrapped up in an infinite wave of falling snowflakes waiting to melt into each other. The forefront sits in perpetual twilight; characters seem to be eclipsed by their own shadows with barely enough to catch a glimpse of who they are. The entire landscape depicts the frigidity of life rising from frosty gales to a calmer ether, only to revert to stormier lands. Movement here isn’t linear. Nothing is. NANA, as a whole, is pure kinetics; an explosion of emotional energy circling, clashing and always          
                              Ai Yazawa did it again.
                              Gotta say, this is one of the most disappointing series to show up in the MAL top list. On the one hand, I found most of the characters really boring. Especially ""Hachiko"" who I couldn't sympathize with at all, and found I felt no pity for her at all in her fate. The other Nana was somewhat better, but overall, all of the female characters come across as being incredibly weak people who have nothing else in life to live for but to succumb to their men. Jun strikes me as the only one with any inner strength but alas she's a side character we          
                              NANA is a Shoujo, Slice of Life, Romance, Drama about the joys, the pain and the struggles that come with the endeavour known as love and romance. If you enjoy your shoujo or romance then NANA is a must see.
                              Shoujo is probably the last word I would use to describe this anime.  
                              NANA is a regrettably incomplete work. It takes viewers on a journey with an intriguing destination, aggravates them with rocky bumps along the way, and then unceremoniously abandons them on the roadside in the middle of nowhere. The story unfolds in reasonably entertaining ways but is too frequently hamstrung by inadequate build and progression with regard to many core characters, and when combined with the abrupt conclusion to the series, bewildered viewers at the very end may be asking themselves, ""Huh? That's it?"", as they lament over NANA's wasted potential and wonder what could have been.
                              I went into this series with no idea of what to expect. I read the synopsis, and it sounded okay, but it does not do justice to the show at all. 
                              ""Nana, how come being happy and making your dreams come true are two different things? Even now, I still don't know why..""
                              Nana has tremendous characters, tremendous art, and a soundtrack that's top tier in every way. If only I'd known how this series ended before I sat through all 47 episodes I never would have bothered in the beginning.
                              Love triumphs the human soul in ways we can’t fathom, and how we can contain it also remains unexplained. Whether it is love in a romantic or friendly fashion, it has always been one of the most sought out themes in stories in every medium imaginable. We are used to the idealistic form of love with many tropes and literary devices, but now we’ve grown to appreciate the “realistic” types of romance. The type I  am refering to is a romance that tries to portray the reality we live in rather than what we hope it will be. Nana can speak for itself as          
                              Yes, I was initially drawn to NANA by Paradise Kiss. After having watched all of ParaKiss in about a day, I was left craving more of that special flavor of drama and the striking art style. However, I was not prepared for the treat I was in for when watching NANA.
                              What can I say about this anime...
                              Nana for me was never a recommendation nor was it and anime I saw discussed on every forum, it was litarilly an anime/manga I stumbled upon one night whilst looking for a cute romantic series. I think that was a really lucky night. ",111

There are obstacles such as competition, stress/anxiety, and other factors that can influence your path to that destination. However, there are some people who just loves to try in order to become the best of the best no matter what the outcomes are. For a certain young girl named Chihaya, the journey continues with this brand          
                               I'm going to be writing this review in assumption that you, the readers, have already watched the first season of Chihayafuru. I dove into this second season with high expectations from the first, and *most* of those expectations were satisfied. We follow Chihaya and everyone else into another year of karuta, drama, and romance. This season explored new themes and served as a lovely follow up to the first.
                              Chihayafuru season 2 is pretty disappointing.

                              Hyakunin Isshu (literally 'hundred people, one poem') is a Japanese card game typically played with a collection of two hundred cards. Each poem in this collection is by a different poet, and split into two halves: the first half for reading, the second for grabbing. In a match, the reading halves are then called out, and pairs of players must race to grabbing the corresponding second half of the poem. Chihayafuru excels by making this game of stratagem into something too human to ignore. It has no regard for how silly or strange a passion for the game may be, because the only thing it's

                              ちはやふる 2 - Chihayafuru 2 is a charming sequel to the popular first season. A truly captivating show and a very successful mix of the sport genre, with exciting competitions and the subtle sophistication of the Shoujo genre through friendship bonds. If you enjoyed the first season, this gentle, yet passionate continuation of sport and drama is sure to appeal to you too.
                              Some increased schizophrenic pacing and frustrating storytelling lead to an experience that is slightly less satisfying than the first season. Another one of those seasons where an additional third could completely redeem and change my opinion of the second. The suspense in this season was almost unbearable but awesome at the same time. A few story elements that were main arcs in the first seemed to get blown over in this season which was a bit disappointing. With all of that said this anime is still very good and really delivers on the action and suspense front. I also found myself really getting into the

                              Chihayafuru season 1 and 2 are a rather strange phenomena for me. When I read the show description back in my pubescent days I was disgusted. What a silly sounding show I thought. I'd seen the good reviews and knew people liked it, but it celebrated such a bizarre piece of Japanese culture that I found my British mind struggling to grasp at the idea of a competitive game involving poems being enjoyable.

124,"Kou Kitamura and Aoba Tsukishima are often at odds—even though their families happen to be close friends and business partners. Although the only child of a sports shop owner, Kou has never been interested in playing baseball. Despite this, he possesses an impressive batting ability honed by frequent visits to the local baseball batting center run by the Tsukushima family. On the other hand, Aoba loves to play baseball and is a star player with exceptional pitching form.

However, these two seemingly complete opposites share something very important to them—Wakaba Tsukishima, Aoba's older sister and Kou's destined sweetheart. Admired by the quarrelsome duo, Wakaba often finds herself the catalyst to their never-ending rivalry. But whether or not they realize that they have more in common than either would care to admit, only time will tell. The game of baseball may just be what the pair needs to ultimately overcome their own personal struggles.

                              “Simple is best.”
                              Cross Game is a very special show. Unlike most shows today, Cross Game is treats both its characters and the audience with respect. On paper, it looks to be yet another baseball series, but it shines as a rare gem of the genre.
                              Well, I will say first of all that both this manga and anime are perfectly nice, perfectly pleasant, and probably perfectly enjoyable for a lot of people. It is all smiles (except for Aoba who is, you know, completely incapable of anything but frowning or looks of indignation), all optimism, and simple but sweet. Unfortunately, that keeps it from being very good either.
                              When I think of Cross Game, I can't help but smile. It is without a doubt my current favorite slice of life anime. Those turned off by sports series need to look past that when picking up Cross Game. While baseball is a huge part of the series, the relationships between the characters is the biggest part of what makes it amazing. Baseball is simply apart of their lives. Those who enjoy character heavy slice of life anime will feel right at home with Cross Game.
                              Many people perceive the combination of genres ""School"" ""Romance"" and ""Drama"" as usual ""stamps"" in the anime industry, and this is understandable, since often such shows are filled with a lot of banal events. Having started watching Cross Game, a skeptical viewer, most likely, will be pleasantly surprised. It is pleasant to realize that already the genre in which, it would seem, it is impossible to find anything new, there are some exceptions that not only make it interesting to watch what is happening, but also in certain events can surprise.
                              Sometimes, simplicity is a beautiful thing. At the heart of ""Cross Game"" is a simple shounen story about baseball and romance. But even though it's the kind of story where you can roughly predict the ending within the first few episodes, there's never a dull moment. Heart warming, heart wrenching, beautiful in its simplicity... the joy of watching ""Cross Game"" comes not from its destination, but from the journey itself.
                              An anime that is perfect in so many ways that it has inspired me to write a review through its sheer perfection.
                              I am typically hesitant to even begin decently long shonen series. They tend to be filled with flaws that reflect lazy writing for the sake of length, unfortunately. From huge casts of characters, ranging from the barely touched upon yet interesting side characters to the incredibly dull main characters who receive much more than their fair share of exposure. On top of that, there are occasionally long stretches of boring developments or slow pacing to keep the content running. Very often these lengthy series become too stagnant and similar to itself, leading me to feeling the need to take breaks from the show simply because          
                              *Note: This review does not contain spoilers, but indirectly alludes to events that take place during the first episode*
                              Writing a review over a sports anime is something I myself never expected to do but Cross Game is in a different league and deserved one. Sports anime generally stick with the basic formula of 1 person having amazing talent and taking a team by his/her hand and making it the best team there is, now if you read the synopsis you will have the same impression as you have with any sports anime however Cross Game(CG from here on) is not your usual sports anime.
                              My first impression of this show was ""another sport-themed anime? ¬¬"". yeah i was expecting something like prince of tennis or captain tsubasa with baseball (you know, naturally impossible balls and over reacting of the game). it comes out that i was wrong.

                              Let's keep this review short, I don't like long reviews, I'm a busy guy with not a lot of free time. Even still, I find it hard to not write a bit about this anime Cross Game, even after two weeks of watching it.

125,"At the renowned Shuchiin Academy, Miyuki Shirogane and Kaguya Shinomiya are the student body's top representatives. Ranked the top student in the nation and respected by peers and mentors alike, Miyuki serves as the student council president. Alongside him, the vice president Kaguya—eldest daughter of the wealthy Shinomiya family—excels in every field imaginable. They are the envy of the entire student body, regarded as the perfect couple.

However, despite both having already developed feelings for the other, neither are willing to admit them. The first to confess loses, will be looked down upon, and will be considered the lesser. With their honor and pride at stake, Miyuki and Kaguya are both equally determined to be the one to emerge victorious on the battlefield of love!

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.43,8,138,82,934673,22527,"                              Confessing love to someone is one of the most intimidating challenges we face in our lives. 
                              To describe Kaguya-sama: Love is War as a battlefield of love, between two prideful geniuses, who see confessing as a sign of “weakness” is well—sort of misleading.
                              Almost every time someone talks to me about a romantic comedy, they'd would mention how well the romance is delivered. Then along came this show called Kaguya-sama: Love is War that goes beyond than just being a romantic comedy. In a landscape dominated by recent isekai shows, there’s a need for fresh air. Kaguya-sama managed be just that. 
                              This is one of those special anime that perfectly represents why I’ve been sticking with anime for so long. Love is War exudes brilliance with every fiber of its being. It has so much going for it, and offers something that practically everyone can enjoy. In simpler terms, it’s just so damn good bruh! What, don’t believe me? pfft, how cute. Let me lecture you on why this anime is pure excellence. 
                              “See, this show's what having a good director can do for your fuckin' show. You can make A-1 Pictures look like a competent studio. That's fucked up!” -DEEsidia from REVEL HOUSE, 2019 
                              A random day back in December 2015 had me giving a chance to at that point very recent manga called Kaguya-sama after the cover grabbed my attention, not too many chapters after I already fell in love with it and it eventually became my favorite work ever and the one that I was waiting like crazy for an adaptation to happen, and when that time came… oh god, they couldn't have delivered harder!

                              ""If I cover my ears, then my hands aren't free to protect my belly button!""
                              I’ve seen plenty of romantic comedy anime series that draw interest with their own sort of game, but never before have I seen such a series like this one strut their stuff and dance it out like this one.

                              In Spring season, i was looking forward to two anime in particular Promised neverland and kaguya sama love is war.
                              When I saw the episode one for 5 mins I stopped watching and closed the site. It was so kind of frustrating to listen to the narrators voice it almost made my ears bleed. 
                              Little to nothing is good about this show.
                              I’ll keep this review simple Love is war isn’t terrible because it’s popular, it’s terrible because nothing happens in the show. I want you to imagine two of your friends wanting to date each other however they both are too proud to admit it to one another. Stretch that for 12 episodes and what you get is a show that will make you sit down for 20 good min of literally nothing. Every episode is like a lead up to progressing the relationship only to go back square 1 with slight variations between each other. For example in one episode they say some endearing things          ",125

Clubmembers Chika Kudou, Satowa Houzuki, Takezou Kurata, Hiro Kurusu, Kouta Mizuhara, Saneyasu Adachi, and Michitaka Sakai are devastated to learn the negative results of their performance, leaving them crushed. Nonetheless, the group recognizes their potential and enthusiastically agree to collectively sharpen their skills, improve their flaws, and develop higher caliber playing to succeed in the upcoming national qualifiers in winter. 

With the help of their now willing club advisor Suzuka Takinami, the group's goal gradually becomes achievable as they begin to grasp the foundations of good music and refine their koto-playing abilities, with the suggestion of performing more often to gain what they lack most—experience. 

However, as their journey to nationals is underway, the koto club members face challenges that obstruct their focus and progress. Not only does the threat of other powerhouse schools and musicians remain, but the high school issues of budding romance and soon-to-be-graduating seniors also begin to push the limits of the determined group of teenagers and the future of the koto club.

With the introduction of Kono Oto Tomare's 1st cour in Spring to set up for the lesser of things, then in Summer, Given's Shoujo-ai outclassed adaptation of a masterpiece, and then back towards this series' 2nd cour to finish up the race that has been built up from the 1st half. And I'd have to say that the experience is totally worth it from start to finish, I can still readily and heartily give this a 10/10 just like          
                              Music is a strange thing. Sometimes, its melody carries a bit of fun and sweetness, making everyone listening immerse in the happiness. Sometimes, it is tinged with a bit of sadness, a pain and hidden feelings bursting out to be heard. But as the melodies intertwine, they bring forth a mixed feeling. As if, the sky is crying.
                              As this anime that has given us a breath of fresh air for this last season of 2019, I just can't help but be amaze that something like this was aired, so kudos for Platinum Vision and Original Creator, Amyuu Sakura for coming up with something like this, so here are my ratings for this ""Very Good"" anime:
                              I completed this series on 4/2/2020 6:29pm
                              Highly recommended! Go for it! 
                              When I found this anime, I thought. Will traditional anime music be as good as some drama music anime such as ""Hibike euphonium"" or ""Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso"" which is very popular, especially seeing studios where there are not many projects like this, but I was wrong.
                              I did a review on the first season. I did it for both seasons so might as well copy paste:
                              The anime is a wonderful piece of storytelling, which really touch me personally. The story means a lot to me in some way, because it relates to me during my early phase of childhood. That being said, without any spoiler, I do really hope that someday, when I grow older, I will be able to have the opportunity to watch another season of the anime. It really touches me, the storytelling is amazing and it may be biased of me to say this but because it tells a story which I personally can relate to at the beginning of my music learning experience.           
                              This review is based on my opinion so don't take it seriously and fyi english isn't my native language. Here is my review from season 2
                              As for me, it must be said that it's almost the best anime I've seen last year.
                              How is it that an anime this peaceful can exist? Someone tell me, because I always click away from each episode feeling happy. 
                              This anime was the most emotional one that I have ever seen!
                              This is just my personal opinion and review of the anime/series.
                              I cannot help myself giving this anime a 10 out of 10 overall. I know that it is a bit bias but hear me out on this one.

When they strike up a conversation, Hanekawa mentions a shocking rumor: a vampire with beautiful blonde hair and freezing cold eyes has been seen lurking around town.

Happy to have made a new friend, Araragi writes off the rumor and goes about the rest of his evening in a carefree manner. However, on his way home, he stumbles across splatters of blood leading down the stairs to the subway. His curiosity pushes him to investigate further, so he follows the gruesome pools into the depths of the station. 

When he arrives at the source of the blood, he is terrified by what he sees—the rumored blonde vampire herself, completely dismembered. After she calls for his help, Araragi must make a decision, one which carries the potential to change his life forever.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.4,8,159,359,375115,2555,"                              It's getting increasingly hard to care about Shaft as an animation studio. Ever since Madoka Magica, they've done nothing but play it safe, churning out sequels to their popular stuff again and again until they became the anime studio version of Nintendo, whilst all their new IP have been so mediocre that with the exception of Nisekoi, nobody remembers them anymore. Not helping is the fact that after so many years, they STILL haven't ditched that outdated Shinbou-animation style that quite frankly looks about as exciting to watch as the same tech demo done on Unreal Engine. Sure it's pretty to look at, but it          
                              Kizumonogatari Tekketsu-hen is a truly sublime experience, an expertly crafted intense mood piece that encapsulates the ideological perspectives and meanderings of the coming-of-age character, such as is Araragi Koyomi; this is all portrayed in a very bloody folklore/supernatural tale complete with limbless vampires, a deus ex machina Hawaiin shirt wearing dude, head-patting, burning corpses, porn magazines, train metaphors, lots of crows masquerading as metaphors, and through sexualized imagery of PANTIES!!! 
                              Ok, I'm not sure what movie the majority of reviewers online watched, but Kizmonogatari (Part 1) was AWFUL. Basically it was boobs bouncing, Araragi sweating/screaming/running, and a bunch of 3D backgrounds that didn't look right with the 2D animated characters. It honestly feels like the creators said ""Ok, time to stretch 20 minutes of plot into 60 minutes. Let's make Araragi gasp and scream and flail for a 20 minute scene."" They wasted so much time under the guise of suspense that when the ""thing"" actually happened, I was bored, not intrigued or excited. By the time the movie actually got interesting, it was over.          
                              Kizumonogatari is, in short, ""A story where no-one ends up happy."".
                              So before I start this my overall view of the show is that a fan of the monogatari series should see it but not pay any money for it because it is bad, really bad. As someone else said there actually 15-20 minutes of actual content stretched over one hour. The main impression the movie made on me was that of young art school student who tries to impress too much. So without delay these are my points against this movie:
                              I remember right after watching the first episode of Owarimonogatari that the trailer for this movie had finally been released.  It looked really good from what I could see, as expected of Shaft.  However, it turned out that Kizumonogatari would be split into three movies which either meant that the studio was trying to do the story justice by giving the full adaptation.  Or, that Shaft was simply only trying to milk the series for what it was worth giving the amount of hype built up over the last couple years.  After watching the movie, I can gladly say it's more          
                              After putting it off for so long and reading (and listening to) the Light Novel a few months ago, I am utterly disappointed and shocked by this first part of Kizumonogatari.
                              Few spoilers ahead**
                              What can I possibly say about this movie? As a monogatari fan, this movie (as well as the other 2 parts of kizu) was absolutely amazing from start to finish in different ways, from the story, characters, animation and music
                              Kizumonogatari was probably the most original and entertaining story about vampires that I read in my life. I did not read much of them. But most were similar. And now finally we have a screen version of the novel.
                              I’m in a unique position, in relation to how people usually view this franchise. I’ve seen pretty much nothing of Monogatari as a series, sans a few early episodes of Bakemonogatari. All I know is that Kizu takes place at the very start of the series, and features a somewhat different style and approach the series overall. I'd heard about how good the Kizumonogatari films were meant to be, and I've always been a little drawn to anime films rather then TV series - so, I dove in, expecting just a feature-length version of what I'd seen in Bakemonogatari.
                              Bloody Brilliant – Kizumonogatari Part 1
                              (8.5/10)
                              Story:
                              The first Kizumonogatari movie can be summed up succinctly in two phrases: pretent- ahem arthouse, and a virgin's perverse wet dream. The art is certainly atmospheric, weaving in the bold color panels and shadow crush the Monogatari series is known for with creatively placed textures and CGI; parts of it seem lifted out of print media together with the moire. The animation is distorted, movements exaggerated -- emotional, to make up for the lack of characterization. It feels very similar to Mind Game, directed by the Masaaki Yuasa of Tatami Galaxy fame. Masaaki is not associated with this work.",145

Shinichiro Watanabe stayed on as director, and it was produced this time by not only Sunrise, but also Bandai Visual (famous for their work on the .hack series and Dennou Coil), and Bones (famous for their work on Fullmetal Alchemist and Ouran High School Host Club).  It was released Stateside by Bandai on August 11th, 2002.
                              I'm never that comfortable with films of series.  Mostly, that's because all too often a film of a series consists of some kind of edited-all-to-hell clip show that tries and totally fails to boil down the story of a long series to a relatively much shorter film.  Knockin' on Heaven's Door isn't that, which is very much in its favour.  Rather, it's basically like a two-hour &quot;lost episode&quot; that belongs somewhere in the middle of the series - without spoiling anything, by the end of the series, there's characters missing who are still present in this film.
                              It was a good follow up (in-between, actually) to the series. I suggest that if you’re planning to watch Cowboy Bebop – Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door, you should watch after you get to the episode when Ed is introduced. You just need to get to know all 4 major characters to understand the movie.

                              Overview:
                              Story:
                              Meant to take place between episodes 22 and 23 of the series, ""Cowboy Bebop - Knockin' on Heaven's Door"" is just like an extra long episode of ""Cowboy Bebop"". It's got the same style, same humour, and even the same underlying melancholic feel. The production somehow manages to look even more expensive than the production of old, with the crisp animation shining through especially, featuring some fluid, breathtaking action sequences that's at least as good as anything in the series.
                              Cowboy Bebop: Knockin' On Heaven's Door (retitled in America as simply Cowboy Bebop: The Movie) is the full-length feature film based on the show of the same name.
                              O.K., let's face it; I haven't seen Cowboy Bebop: The Movie in a very long time now and let's note that I am a HUGE Cowboy Bebop fan and was quite disappointed to see the movie on television and say that it just wasn't my cup of tea. 
                              Okay guys, what's up all... It's 5:21pm as I'm writing this.  What i have to say I was a little disappointed to see little in the way of either cowboys or dancing in the feature of the same name (which came out in Japan in 2001, but hit U.S. theaters briefly in the spring of 2003), but that's ultimately probably for the best. In the world of Cowboy Bebop, it's the year 2071, a time when the Earth has become almost uninhabitable and everyone has moved out to other planets in the solar system, like Mars. The plucky little band of bounty hunters who          
                              It's a good film no doubt but it's definitely a bit too long. It plays like an extended TV episode (which isn't necessarily a bad thing) but unfortunately it isn't up there with the best episodes to be found in the series. Still it's always good to see Spike and the gang in action seeing as it looks like there isn't going to be a new series made anytime soon for obvious reasons! Its very stylised and is fantastically shot but it seems to drag at times. It would have been nice if it could've linked in a bit more of the Vicious/Julia/Spike backstory into          
                              I've been on a roll with this Cowboy Bebop show. Just finished the series earlier today, and now I'm done with the film. Let's jump into this review!
                              Three years after the conclusion of Cowboy Bebop, we return once more to the futuristic world of Spike Spiegel and his fellow bounty hunters to solve one last bounty, one that boasts the highest stakes of them all. Tengoku no Tobira challenges the conventions of an ""anime film"" by serving as a proper, standalone addition to a well-renowned, richly developed universe. 
                              Cowboy Bebop Knocking on heavens door is an outstanding film that will always have a place in my top movies.  
                              So the Cowboy Bebop basically got all the parts that the TV show didn't really capture, Spike is a cool guy at the forefront of a major kind of planetary issue, and it's cool to be on his side. Unlike the show, it plays up his charming and suave compassion/skill and less his burdened past and all that. ",146
150,"Justice, and the enforcement of it, has changed. In the 22nd century, Japan enforces the Sibyl System, an objective means of determining the threat level of each citizen by examining their mental state for signs of criminal intent, known as their Psycho-Pass. Inspectors uphold the law by subjugating, often with lethal force, anyone harboring the slightest ill-will; alongside them are Enforcers, jaded Inspectors that have become latent criminals, granted relative freedom in exchange for carrying out the Inspectors' dirty work.

Into this world steps Akane Tsunemori, a young woman with an honest desire to uphold justice. However, as she works alongside veteran Enforcer Shinya Kougami, she soon learns that the Sibyl System's judgments are not as perfect as her fellow Inspectors assume. With everything she has known turned on its head, Akane wrestles with the question of what justice truly is, and whether it can be upheld through the use of a system that may already be corrupt.

But I didn't find the anime to be anything more than your run of the mill dark themed series. Before throwing off my review as a hated one, I would appreciate it if you guys just took a couple of minutes to read what I thought of Psycho Pass
                              There is nothing more undefined, blurry, and vague than the line that separates ""good"" from ""bad"". What complicates the matter further is the question of ""is said action more bad/good than another?"" Why do we consider the murder of an innocent person a worse offense compared to something like a bank robbery? Is a doctor who saves hundreds of lives more ""good"" than a simple volunteer at a homeless shelter? While Psycho Pass may not be a realistic representation of today's societal state, the observation of human morals, psychological concepts, and fluctuation of emotions can all be applied to our methodology of thinking and our          
                              After watching this series twice within a short amount of time (a month or so) and still enjoying it to the fullest, I felt compelled to finally write my first MAL review. 
                              Crime is a constant in human civilization. Theft, murder, and countless other atrocities have been committed  by people in every civilization throughout history; try as we might, humans have always had trouble preventing crimes from happening, let lone eliminating them completely. However, what if advancement in technology eventually provided a system that could accurately assess a person's capacity to commit a crime? That is the question posed in Production I.G.'s dystopian sci-fi crime thriller Psycho-Pass: a searing, violent, and ambitious exploration of crime, justice, and the system that judges which is right in a society. Filled with interesting concepts, it is unfortunate that the          
                              Hey you, turn on the news. 
                              Urobuchi Gen certainly made name for himself during last couple seasons. Known for his dark and edgy, sometimes nihilistic approach to writing that leaves trail of bodies and broken characters, it's hard to overlook his works. His works of Fate/zero and Madoka, that definitively left impact on anime scene for better or worse, coupled with Production I.G. creative history of making Ghost in the Shell franchise, made me hope that we would get darker, more Urobuchi-like version of GitS, something I would definitively enjoy a lot. Unfortunately, it didn't take too long to me to get disillusioned that such dream wouldn't come true due to          
                              It has been a while since there has been a dystopian, psychological, police thriller of this popularity since Ghost in The Shell first aired. Writer Urobuchi Gen, famous for his works on the Fate/Stay Night series, and Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica, decided to use his deft hand at writing and give us his own twisted version of the future. Psycho Pass is a dystopian crime thriller, centered around human morality. Is it right to sacrifice individual freedom, for safety? Is it right to condemn someone for something they might do? 
                              ""It's not the final judgement of ""good"" and ""evil"" that's important. What matters is that you come to that decision yourself. That you agonize over it and eventually accept it."" -Akane Tsunemori
                              The Butcher strikes again with an intense action set in a chilling dystopia that, regrettably, is one of his weakest works.
                              In short, ""Psycho Pass"" is a weak, pretentious and utterly misguided show. There are two main reasons for that. First - very general failure of the show in constructing a sensible futuristic vision and second - its not exactly superb writing.
                              *Somewhat spoilerish materials in this review. I will try to fix that as I continue to grow as a writer!*
                              To me, Psycho-Pass was great largely because of its world. The basic premise is ""What if we could tell criminal minds apart from normal ones?"", and in the show, the conclusion of this is that the governmental Sibyl System aggressively monitors your mental state, so that they can arrest or execute you provided you are sufficiently criminal. 
                              I'm gonna keep this brief: Watch this series. Fortunately I wasn't someone who started watching the show when it first aired, because goddamn, the hype and cliffhangers from episode to episode would have driven me crazy. Anyways, if I need to justify why this series is very good, here ya go. 
                              In our modern world, society is essentially the dictator of all law and judgement. A justice system, in reality, is merely a representation of what we as a society believe is ""right"" or ""wrong"". People who step outside this box, are often penalized - at the most extreme point, we refer to these people as criminals.
                              Once in a while, there comes along an anime that claims to go against the industry's trend. An anime that claims to be unique in a time when the market is filled mostly with indistinguishable moe clones and so on. This is a very good marketing strategy for Psycho Pass if you ask me, especially given the gorgeous artwork and an exciting concept. In addition to this, it was touted as the 'next GITS'. Needless to say, I picked this up with VERY HIGH expectations.  expectations which were about to come crashing down faster than you could say 'psychopath'. ",150

                              Note: This is a remake of the classic Battle Ship Yamato by Leiji Matsumoto which is one of the most revolutionary anime.
                               	To be called “The Star Wars of Japan” you must be doing something oh so right.  “Space Battleship Yamato (1974- 1975) was labeled as such. It’s a show so imbedded in popular culture that I had even heard of it. This was long before even watching my very first anime (To me known as “Star Blazers” for US).  It was truly the show of an age. Now fast forward to April, 7th, 2012, an OVA remake of the beloved classic begins its air time.  The final question of fans was. Will it live up to the original?  Or disappoint us          
                              Remakes or reboots often get a bad rap in the anime community as many beloved series often get messed up and butchered in an attempt to add a more modern spin on an already old and classic series. Space Battleship Yamato 2199, however, is a remake of the classic series that is not only able to catch the spirit of the original, but is able to expand further and vastly improve and succeed on what the 1974 version couldn’t do in terms of production values. This OVA remake has become the pinnacle of what a modern space opera should be, and I’ll explain why this          
                              THIS COULD BE AN EPIC ANIME... but it falls short. Therefore only 7/10. You will enjoy it at first and then you will get disappointed, wishing it could be perfect. I hate anime like that. 
                              About two years ago, I watched through the original Star Blazers/Yamato series, as well as the sequel and inter-quel movies that accompanied them. While they each had significant flaws (under-developed characters, lack of world building, and short-changed arcs in the case of season 3), I enjoyed following the adventures of the Space Battleship Yamato from series to series thanks to its well-animated fight scenes for the time, thought-provoking (if heavy-handed), exploration of moral grey areas, and the inspirational message that no matter what happens, good will triumph over evil.
                              A journey; a trek; a voyage, that's how watching Uchuu Senkan Yamato 2199 feels like.
                              So at the time of writing this review i have seen this artwork twice. The first time was in 2013. Second time at the end of 2017, just a day before 2018.
                              I have not seen the original Yamato, so this review has not ""old-new"" hate or nostalgia. It's about Yamato 2199 as a singular anime series.
                              Considering the very high rating, I'm a bit disappointed. Sad to say, because it certainly had potential to be better.
                              Wow!  This show absolutely blew me away!  I haven't enjoyed a series so much in a long time.  I've been going through movies and shows, from all sorts of genres and eras and styles, and rarely does anything have everything I want to see in an anime, and this is one of those!  I'll admit, I put off looking into any of the Space Battleship Yamato series or movies simply because the surface concept seemed so outrageous - a World War 2 style battleship...IN SPACE?  That's CRAZY!  I could not have been more wrong.
                              For those that wonder about this anime, you might not partially like space-related anime. But I warn you, give this anime an chance. I wasn't too keen on watching this show but I gave it an chance. And guess what? I was surprised that I actually liked it.
                              I was originally going to rate this a 7, because while I enjoyed it, I didn't think the story was all that remarkable - heroes go out into space, defeat the universe, and save the planet - you've seen it all before right? But then I considered how much I like the characters, and the little things that must have been thought about to make everything flow; there was nothing in the series that dragged on or rushed through, or that didn't somehow contribute to the plot or the characters, and it results in a very wholesome feeling anime.
                              It is so difficult to rate. It's quite enjoyable but also has so many irritating faults. Not to mention that it's rated really high and by that was a total letdown.
                              Three days ago I had no idea what Space Battleship Yamato 2199 was; I had no idea about the original series made back in the 1970s; I had no idea of the cultural significance it has in Japan, on par with Star Wars in the West; but I have corrected my woeful ignorance and it was one of the best decisions I've made.",158

However, unease looms as Saki begins to question the fate of those unable to awaken to their powers, and the children begin to get involved with secretive matters such as the rumored Tainted Cats said to abduct children.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.35,8,187,170,620859,20573,"                                      Little inspection into the dystopia genre is required to realise that the majority of the dystopic anime are set in a cyberpunk universe. Be it Psycho Pass, Ergo Proxy or Texhnolyze, the average viewer is likely to have seen these ""hi-tech"" interpretations of future societies. Enter Shinsekai Yori – a series where whose setting is uncannily quaint such that on first glance, it is hard to see it as a dystopia; but it is, and an exceptionally remarkable one indeed.
                              “We ultimately fear what spawns from within us.”
                              Shinsekai yori is truly a great series. I've been wanting to write this review for a long time but I decided to wait until the series finished to do so as to write an accurate and coherent review as possible. After 6 months and 25 wonderful episodes, here it is. I will do my best to keep this review spoiler free. 
                              In recent years, many series have found success by centering themselves upon flagrant fanservice and fast-paced action. Shinsekai Yori, however, is the antithesis of this trend. 
                              Shinsekai Yori or From The New World's most convincing moments occur within the first four episodes. The story, which follows a group of psychokinetic children in the year 3000 in a dystopic yet serene Japanese environment, seamlessly weaves plot device after plot device until the granddaddy of straight-forward storytelling literally walks up to the main cast. A beast is captured by our protagonist, Saki, and explains to them upon request, what has happened to Japan to change it so drastically in the last 1000 years. The world of Shinsekai Yori takes four well-crafted episodes to establish it's universe believably. What follows seems tangentially related to          
                              Fear, Loss, Hope and Betrayal. Desire, Strength, Lies, and Perfection. If only Shinsekai Yori could be described with just these few words. You rarely see an anime that blends the Story, Art, Sound, and the growth of Characters so fluently. Its not simple to achieve this level of artistry. As a result, it’s not a simple story to watch. Your constantly given questions till the very end. However this makes the anime incredibly enjoyable to watch. It feels as though your brought closer into the story because of it. This Dark masterpiece questions humanities desires, darkens the line that separates Children form Adults, and presents          
                              Shinsekai Yori, or From The New World, is a teen-oriented piece of dystopic speculative fiction, the latest addition in this new wave of teen fiction to which the success of Hunger Games has opened the doors.
                              There's often a point in one's life to acknowledge the possibility of another worldly phenomenon that is outside of our collective conscience from where we live in that is in contrast with our own ideals. This has always been a subject of discussion since Plato's ""Allegory of the Cave"" that chronicles how our limited understanding of the reality that we perceive may not be what it seems since we're so entrenched in our own ideological society. Many works of fiction have dabbled this subject matter numerous times with some succeeding and others failing. Unfortunately for Shinsekai Yori, it falls into the latter, but not entirely.
                              Shinsekai yori was something else...
                              What started off as an interesting piece on a dystopian style future fantasy world quickly squandered all the good sense it had at the outset and devolved into a moral confused and seemingly pointless story line. 
                              [4.0/10]
                              **SPOILER FREE REVEIW**
                              Everyday we wake up, preform our daily ritual, then go to sleep, and all the while the world around us seems so perfectly normal. We, as people, have evolved to accept the normalcy of everyday life. It is seeing how people really act when normalcy is torn away from them that many people find so intriguing. 
                              Shinsekai Yori (From the New World) is something of an eclectic anime series. It's based off a novel, which hands it very different premises compared to anime that are based off manga or games (and for that matter, original anime), which is pretty evident in its characters and story, following few of the bigger anime clichés.
                              Upon revisiting this anime exactly two months from when I last finished it, (03/31/13) I am reminded of things that I have missed and that is this.",171

                              Coming here to review the donghua after completing all 11 episodes. 
                              Outstanding, beginning to end. A pity that the end came so soon!, i seriously hope we get more seasons on this. 
                              It's an absolute masterpiece of an adaptation.
                              I found out this is another one of my favorite authors works so i was curious and watched it ,and i didn't regret it. The story is unique, very original ,just love it. At 1st i didnt know about the plot of this donghua but i fell in love with it just from watching one episode.
                              Eh, to be honest, it isn't that great. Don't get me wrong, it's good, but not gonna lie here, it's not that great, at least not as great as everyone is raving about. I was never a huge fan of the original novel, but some of the problems of the original are exemplified even more here. 
                              Sience my first language is not English, there may be some mistakes in this review.
                              Heaven Official's Blessing, a.k.a Tian Guan Ci Fu, a.k.a. TGCF is my first ""donghua"" ever. I haven't heard of it before, hence I realised it was very reasonable I haven't heard it before cause appearently it's considerably something new.
                              Disclaimer: I have not read the original source material and am fairly new to this genre.
                              Much anticipated TGCF adapts a BL novel, but lacks much development details in the relationship. While I haven't read the source material, I can't help but feel something was missing. For much of the show Xie Lian was almost weak and docile, like he couldn't wait to fall into the arms of a stranger he has just met. Such a notion lacks substance regardless of gender. There are no little touches nor moments that spark, and the relationship just seems to fall into place unwarranted, between two handsome men with no personalities. 
                              Story: 10
                              Is this the best that Chinese animation has to offer? Perhaps. Only time will tell.
                              I really love the story, and every element in it is top-notch. I gotta say, like many others, I'm obsessed with this donghua too. I too think that the production team had done an excellent job with this adaptation.  The characters, scenery, the songs, I love every single thing about this anime!:) 
                              After reading the novel back in 2019 it was like a dream come true finding out the donghua trailer to it.The whole story is a masterpiece, 10/10 - recommend!
                              So far, I'm still at episode 5 but in a summary it's basically about how a prodigious prince, Xie Lian cultivated to the point where he ascended into the heavens, and his fall from grace back to the mortal realm. One of the things I love about the show is how Xie Lian ascended to the heavens, only to realise that the heaven officials are just as, if not more petty, shallow and hypocritical then the mortals who are worshipping them. Xie Lian soon discovers that what the heavens find pleasing might not always be moral, in fact they often rooted in appealing to the          ",176

                              The franchise of Type-Moon. Fate/Stay Night is a trademark for what the product has been with its key characters, premise, and setting. Fate Unlimited Blade Works is one of its major routes and returns for another season. A show about the Holy Grail sparkles into a pendulum of events and animated by the infamous Ufotable studio. Part 1 delivered what many fans wanted while part 2 attempts to do so yet again.
                              When news about this series was launched, I somewhat had mixed feelings; the original Fate/Stay Night was so horrible, I pity myself for watching it, while Fate/Zero was absolutely fantastic, plus Ufotable, responsible for Fate/Zero, were producing it.
                              The Fate series holds a very special place in my heart, the escapades of Shirou Emiya and his servant Saber have enthralled me in a way that a lot of stories did not. From the romance in ""Fate"" to the climatic ""Heaven's Feel"", Fate/stay night hasn't just become one of my favorite stories, it's honestly become my favorite thing to come out of Japan.
                              Ever since I first watched Fate/Stay Night anime, I got hooked. A lot of people were complaining how it didn't live up to their expectations especially the ones who played the Visual Novel before, but as someone who didn't, I quite enjoyed the anime a bit. Of course afterwards I immediately went to play the game, and I managed to only finish the Fate route for some reason. Then I went to explore a bit for other TYPE-MOON series and discovering Tsukihime and Kara no Kyoukai, which the latter is one of my all time favorite.

                              The first cour had a great progress. However, it declined a bit this second cour.
                              The anime first of all had a different feeling compared to season one for me while the animation style was great as well as the sound the storyline didn't really indulge me as much as the first season did their wasn't that want for more really and the need to watch more and hate the fact that you had to wait a week to watch the next episode there was a lack of that really i mean some episode had a splash of cliff hangar but only three or four really did.
                              This Review applies to both seasons of Unlimited Blade Works. The Video review is up on my channel, but here is the written.

Nasu's highly intricate and appealing designs brought to life by Ufotable, who are excellent in visuals and art.  This partnership works to great extent but was unfortunately lacking in the other important components such as character development, relatability and execution of the story that are needed to create a compelling narrative.

                              After the first season of FSN:UBW I had high hopes that the second season would make up for at least some of the issues I had with season 1.  It turns out it did not in almost any way.

191,"Twenty-two-year-old college dropout Tatsuhiro Satou has been a hikikomori for almost four years now. In his isolation, he has come to believe in many obscure conspiracy theories, but there is one in particular which he holds unshakable faith in: the theory that the evil conspirator behind his shut-in NEET (Not in Employment, Education or Training) status is the Nihon Hikikomori Kyokai (NHK)—an evil and secret organization dedicated to fostering the spread of hikikomori culture.

NHK ni Youkoso! is a psychological dramedy that follows Tatsuhiro as he strives to escape from the NHK's wicked machinations and the disease of self-wrought isolation, while struggling to even just leave his apartment and find a job. His unexpected encounter with the mysterious Misaki Nakahara might signal a reversal of fortune for Tatsuhiro, but with this meeting comes the inevitable cost of having to face his greatest fear—society.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.33,8,205,204,553114,21393,"                              Welcome to the N.H.K. is the story of a 22-year-old hikikomori/NEET named Satou Tatsuhiro.
                                   Are you new to anime? Or are you a veteran? Well, with ""NHK ni Youkoso!"" it doesn't matter! This is one of those anime that you can easily get through, want more, think about it's message and wonder how such a masterpiece isn't more popular. Not only does this anime entertain it's audience with a wonderful story, a variety of characters, great sound affects and great music, but it also teaches the viewer about the difficulties of social anxiety and psychological disorders. There are only a handful of anime out there that handle such delicate subjects and shower them in          
                              First, let me say that I saw this entire show in a period of 3 days. So, that in itself says something about how enjoyable it was. If I wasn't having a good time watching it, then I wouldn't have bothered doing 12 episodes in one day. :)
                              I was expecting a dark Satoshi Kon style satire on hikikomorism; the dehabilitating affects of media as represented by the NHK broadcasting company and post millennium conspiracy theories, but instead this anime merely uses hikkomorism as a backdrop for melodramatic relationship angst and blues.
                              Welcome to the world of mental disorders, in which everything looks colorful yet mundane. It is a world that lets affected people transcend the borders of the ordinary by allowing them to impose their very own interpretation of the world upon the circumstances that surround them. This way, people learn to cope with their sometimes unpromising situations by making use of their powerful minds alone.
                              I can honestly say that I've never been so happy to be done with a series. This show is barely watchable, and it all stems from the main character.
                              There exists something rare in this medium. In fact, its so rare, that only a handful of titles have managed to do this and still make the anime work. This trait is called realistic chemistry of characters. In a fictional work, it's virtually impossible to create relations so genuine, that it is almost frightening to experience when you do so. You are aware that what you're witnessing is made-up, but can't help comparing the characters' life to yours, as well as the struggles they encounter.
                              Every now and then you come across those shows that just strike you with a sort of emotional response you rarely get elsewhere. It's not a directly tragic response, it's more a gentle, melancholy feeling - a poignant way of portraying reality for what it is - not a happy optimistic place, not a place where you're guaranteed a bright future, but a harsh place that some people find so hard to deal with they shut themselves away from it instead.
                              NHK ni Youkoso is an anime based off a novel and manga of the same name by Tatsuhiko Takimoto. It is a story about a hikikomori and NEET (Not currently engaged in Employment, Education or Training) named Tatsuhiro Sat&#333; who struggles with who he is and just getting through daily life.
                              Welcome to the NHK is a Seinen, Psychological, Comedy, Drama about a guy who has become a hikikomori (someone who has shut themselves away from society) and is living his life believing in conspiracies. Then his life is suddenly turned around when some girl decides to cure him of his hikikomori ways.
                              Welcome to the NHK has become my go-to when I want to recommend someone a series (mostly to a male audience I would say, though.) It's got a truly great mix of laughs, cringes, tears, light romance, stress, and all manner of feels. The series ultimately sums up all of the ways a modern man could be truly pathetic, and presents it in a way that makes us all contemplate, laugh at, and root for ourselves.
                              Here it is, people. This is no hyperbole. NHK is the worst anime of all time. It is one of the worst pieces of media you can conjure. A reality show about the Kardashians must be better than this. Pathetic YouTube parodies are better than this. In order to make something worse than this, you’ll need to let Ian Watkins brag about his pedophilia in the Lostprophets album that was never made.
                              I have long heard that &ldquo;Welcome to the NHK!&rdquo; (which I will call WttNHK for short) is a fairly good anime with strong comedic elements. This is an understatement. What lies beneath the superficial surface that WttNHK posits itself to enclose are a myriad of thematics pertaining to human interaction, societal repression, and the core motivations behind human behaviour. Let us explore:
                              Welcome to the NHK (NHK ni Youkouso), first broadcast in 2006, is a fantastic series that mockingly celebrates deviant cultures versus their &ldquo;normal&rdquo; counterparts in modern Japan. This bizarre celebration is presented through a narrative focusing primarily on the protagonist Sato Tatsuhiro, those around him, and the struggles they face&mdash;at the center of which is Sato&rsquo;s concerning status of hikkikomori.

However, Kotarou is forced to remain on the run when he finds himself being hunted down by assassins sent by China's Ming Dynasty for mysterious reasons not involving his petty crimes. 

Fortunately, the duo run into Nanashi, a ronin who has taken refuge in a small temple, when Kotarou is attacked and Tobimaru poisoned. Although the samurai  saves the helpless pair from their pursuers, he feels that there is no need to help them further; but when offered a gem in exchange for his services as a bodyguard, he reluctantly accepts Kotarou's offer of employment—just until Tobimaru is healed and the two reach their destination. As the three set out on a perilous journey, it soon becomes evident that their path is riddled with danger, as the Ming Dynasty has now sent a terrifying swordsman after them to capture Kotarou and fulfill a certain prophecy.

There are scenes in it that are shocking, jaw-dropping, amazing...if you haven't seen this movie yet, and you like action movies, with a good plot, solid characters, and the best action sequences I've ever seen in an anime, then beg, borrow, stea---er, do whatever you can to get your hands on it. You won't regret it. Take my word for it.
                              Story:
                              Are you searching for a bland movie with a paucity in character development, predictable plot points, and subpar-to-average animation, then you’re in luck — because Sword of the Stranger (Stranger: Mukou Hadan) exists for your substandard anime expectations.  For anyone who does have a shred of self-respect, however, should eschew themselves from this tedious movie watching experience for something with, I don’t know, some modicum of originality.  But I digress, on to the review.
                              An epic tale of a young boy on the run for his life and a mysterious wandering samurai who coincidentially run into eachother at a abadoned temple. The rest of the story falls into place after thier meeting. Within the first 10 minutes of this anime you are engulfed in a small battle of thieves trying to rob a caravan whose guards are these mysterious samurai with red capes, giving you a taste of what kind of action and gore that is to come. Heads and limbs get cut off and arrows pierce necks and heads in a wonderful display of swordsmanship and archery. If          
                              I happened to stumble upon a little hidden gem, a couple days back by the name ""Sword of the Stranger"".  I was surprised by how few people were talking about the film.  The only threads I found about the anime were very specific and spoiler heavy; no general discussions, no recommendation topics.  Naturally this lead me to suspect the worst, but I figured I'd give SOTS a shot anyway.  Besides, at only an hour and a half in length I wouldn't be wasting that much time.  I'm quite glad I did, because this movie is the very definition of a          
                              Andy, from AnimeNfo, wrote: &quot;Stranger is a martial arts tale of self sacrificing heroism. This premise is far from original, as are the characters. It is nonetheless solid, and combined with all the dramatic brutality one could ask for from Samurai action, the complete package is a joy to watch.&quot; 
                              I initially saw previews of this movie while I was in Japan last October. It was being released pretty much right after I left, and I was there for a full month. But there was an awesome display at the Manga museum in Kyoto with an original script, and other memorabilia. When I saw the previews, I knew this movie was going to rock. But I never imagined BONES would deliver such a timeless tale. This movie will become one of the classics as time progresses.
                              This movie did, as someone mentioned in their review, come out of nowhere. I actually learned of it because there was a poster for the dubbed version showing in the US theatres coming in Feb. 
                              When I decided to watch this movie it was without any expectations but I was more than pleasantly surprised! Sword of the Stranger has to be one of the best lesser-known anime out there and for how good it is, it deserves to be much, much more popular.

                              This is my first review and I am doing it in order to improve how I judge the anime I watch. Thus, I am sticking to the story/art/sound/character/enjoyment rating, because I think it is a good way to categorize rating.
                              Some men kill in order to live.  Some don't need a reason...
                              Let me start by saying this movie has great animation and great action BUT that's where the praise ends for this movie. 
                              Sword of the Stranger is not a groundbreaking or innovative dish you would find in a five-star restaurant, but rather an average dish with all your favorite ingredients which you love to savor day after day. This film doesn’t fall into the trap of constantly trying to be what it isn’t, that being a frequent issue with many shows and movies alike. It knows its limits, explores the possibilities within the boundaries, and milks every bit of essence out of it making a simple, yet delightful experience. It is neither groundbreaking nor the pinnacle of story telling, but it was a whole damn lot of

(Source: ANN)",8.29,8,230,1222,120836,589,"                              By expressionism and symbol, a silver spoon is symbolic for wealth. The phrase of “been born with a silver spoon in his mouth” is synonymous relating to an individual born from the rich family. But the series, Silver Spoon/Gin no Saji, stands on the opposite side of that symbol. Most of the characters aren’t rich and neither are any of them born from a wealthy family. However, what they do have is the talent and ambition that drives them to fulfill a dream. Making a dream into a reality is tough. Competitions and life itself becomes an obstacle. Gin no Saji/Silver Spoon delivers that very

                              Note: this was written a long time ago as a review of both seasons, but I’m submitting it to season 2 because reasons.
                              I think the second season is so much better. Like the show is so much more interesting. I don't think its really good but something about this anime that makes me want to watch the next episode and the next episode and the next episode until I finished it quickly haha. Funny how I didn't want the show to end soon but I keep going to the next episode. Friendship, family, dreams... all the aspects that u can find in real life, it's soooo relatable. And as I expected, I'm glad that Hachiken and Mikage's relationship is progressing haha I really wish the best for          
                              Minor spoilers ahead. Proceed with caution.
                              SILVER SPOON tackles some very different and serious themes in its second season, while still retaining that effervescent charm that made me fall in love with it immediately. Hachiken's growth continues to be compelling and relatable, regardless of what my own school or family experience has been like.
                              Gin no Saji is one of the few feel good anime that just makes you feel refreshed and motivated if you are feeling down or just in the spiral of depression. The story starts off with Hachiken, a normal school student who runs off to an Agricultural school to get a break from all the pressure he's in and the breakdown from not being able to clear his entrance exam.
                              Gin no Saji 2nd Season is undoubtedly a masterpiece in the slice of life genre - for myself especially.
                              The second season of Silver Spoon is just as good as the first, if not better. It continues and develops the story that in the first series was presented so well. There is now a greater focus on the characters and their development, and not only Hachiken as was the case in the first season: now Mikage is a main character as well.
                              This anime is surprisingly enjoyable. I really didn't expect to like it as much as I did. I mean, it's an agricultural anime. You wouldn't think that'd appeal to a majority of people, but it's honestly an anime that anyone would love. It's very charming.

                              I loved and enjoyed  the story, the game, the fights, the art, the sounds, the opening/ending, the characters, the final saddest moment at the end of the last episode when i realized that it was the end too.

This review is aimed at two groups of people: those who are planning to watch this after finishing the rest of the old adaptation, and those who have watched the new 2011 adaptation and are thinking about watching this. These are probably the two biggest groups of people looking into this OVA. 
                              At last, I have arrived at the finale of my reviews of Hunter X Hunter 1999 and its OVAs. Kinda pissed me off that I had to release them during a time I had said I’d be doing nothing but Gundam reviews, but whatever. Sadly however, these OVAs did not end on a good note, as the final events of the 1999 Version of the Greed Island arc are… well, not very good to say the least.
                              The story was good not too complex for us to get lost in and not too simple for it to be predictive and boring. The art was definelty better than the series since the series was in 1999 while the ova was in 2004. Also the music was also composed nicely especially those piano beats.  But there were some problems with it. Firsly it was the pacing. They skipped some parts of the Greed Island Arc and so we didn't really get to immerse ourselves into the characters since they were rushing have the half time until near the end of the ova.

                              Hi all, this is my first review on MAL. Please bare with me, but I feel like I should share my opinion on this and why I gave it the score I did. I wouldn't say I'm the most hardcore anime fan, but I have definitely seen my fair share of shows and am pretty much a typical anime viewer. I review anime in my mind pretty differently than others. Note, there may be a lot of extra information that is unneeded for this review, but I really want to put my perspective on this as much as possible. If you don't care, just scroll          
                              Ahh, the reviewer. The first line of defense to quell the flames of irrational thought and often the bearer of bad news for those of the general public. They're the Buzz Killingtons that take it upon themselves to blow the ""no fun"" whistle and send the partygoers back on the hype-train that they rode in on. It's a thankless job, one that doesn't reward anyone besides the smug satisfaction of the man with the whistle, tipping his top hat and waving ""adieu"" at the fanbase, outraged that someone had the audacity to bring an analytical lens to the ""totally bitchin party, bruh!""
                              Imagine a show that repackages some of the most recurring themes in anime today and make it into a fantasy thriller. That’s what Re:Zero essentially is. Adapted from the novels of the same name, the show is more of a darker fantasy story than most people may be familiar with. It’s not exactly like a show where a character is stuck in a world and they try to find a way out. Or is it making a parody of the show itself. Rather, Re:Zero (Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu) is a fantasy thriller that has some delirious complexity.
                              A final review of Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu 
                              Before I start my review, let me just say one thing - FUCKING WATCH THIS SHIT! You will never expect what's coming if you just base your opinion on its premise or art style.
                              Re: Zero was an anime that I thought wouldn't be very good. I started watching the episode expecting to be dissapointed that it would be a generic ""other world"" anime. I thought this up until the last scene were the main character is murdered. Soon afterward he ""respawns"" at a fruit stand in the market, this is what hooked me. I realized that this anime is doing something no anime has done before. It made me care about the characters, and even become sad when they died even though I knew it would just be reset when Subaru dies.
                              Note: This review was written a while ago when the show was over. Thus, it does not necessarily represent my current opinions, writing, scores or anything really. Still, I somewhat stand with the core ideas of the review.
                              Re: Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu. 
                              This is quite though anime to give insights on. There are a lot of part from this anime that I really like, as much as parts that I didn't really like. But I did enjoy this anime a lot and it is worth for overall 9.
                              This review of Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu is solely based on my personal views and overall enjoyment watching the show.
                              Ahh Re:Zero, the anime that is in my opinion looking to be the best show this year (beating erased). The anime that actually inspired me to write my first anime review, despite me being a lazy fk. 
                              This was hands down one of the best anime I have ever seen, The story, art and soundtracks fit together like pieces of the same puzzle giving off - Depending on situation - A feeling of happiness or despair. It will keep you at the edge of your seat craving for more, and that's exactly why I waited for it to finish airing in order to start watching.
                              I'm pretty sure some of you are thinking that Re: Zero is another overhyped anime that isn't nowhere near the hype it deserves. Well, let me just say it now: Re: zero deserves all of that hype and score, or at least most of it. It is an exceptional anime, composed of many different kinds of elements that elevates the anime even further. The entertainment (and despair) it manages to give every single episode is astounding, and paired with great characters and great animation and music, makes this anime truly a must watch for any anime fan.",217
221,"With its armies sweeping across the continent, the Empire seems unstoppable. After securing victory over the remnants of the Republic's army, the Empire's ultimate victory is finally within reach. However, dark clouds are gathering in the East. The communist-led Russy Federation is mustering troops on its western border, preparing to enter the war. Supported by a detachment of Allied volunteer magicians—among whom is Mary Sioux, the daughter of a soldier killed by Tanya Degurechaff—the Federation is determined to spread the communist creed and bring the Empire to its knees.

Meanwhile, Tanya and her battalion return to the imperial capital from the southern front. Upon their arrival, they are tasked with investigating troop movements on the border with the Federation. Any escalation of violence at this point may lead to new conflicts, plunging the world into a devastating global war.

Will the Empire eventually emerge victorious from its struggle, or will it crumble in the face of superior enemies and radically different ideologies?

                              The long awaited sequel to the Youjo Senki series, this movie brings in a new character and antagonist to light. Once again, our sociopathic salaryman loli finds herself in a complex predicament reminiscent of our world’s historical world wars, facing the interference of being x at the worst possible times. Like the original series, Tanya’s squad 203 sets out to face enemies that appears impossible to win against, according to their political and strategic heads, and the battles are reflective of the nature of difficulty.
                              Just personal scratch.
                              While the movie I feel is good, I am somewhat disappointed at it. It pains me to say this since i'm a big Tanya fan. One of my big problems for the movie is that, while the movie is action packed, battles are quite often short or skipped, then summarised. I feel like I was constantly being teased with those battles with really no pay off until the final big battle. Another problem I have is with charactor growth/arc. I don't want to spoil anything so I won't go into details. I feel like the main atagonist Mary Sue's arc was just way to speed          
                              The anticipated sequel of Youjo Senki has finally arrived & starts off immediately from where it left off (along with some “spoilers” of the future events). From start to finish, the movie has Tanya kicking butts left & right, the Infamous loli smile and Tanya kicking butts again but this time with style. Although the story and characters felt pretty bland to me but had a great time watching it nevertheless.
                              ITS FINALLY BACK!!!!!
                              A few months late to writing a review. Youjo Senki's film debut offers the same great animation, humour, story and action that fans of the series have come to expect, dialled up to 100. The film manages to encapsulate everything that's great about Youjo Senki and is fun throughout. I was certainly not disappointed.
                              I'll keep it short.
                              In the approximate time it takes Tanya to turn a battle around I saw the series and the movie lol.
                              Subarashi!
                              After watching the movie, I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed it. If you liked Season 1, hope you're ready for some new content in ""Loli Hitler VS The Commies.""
                              This review will include **SPOILERS**
                              I can still feel the dread curling in my stomach as I watched each and every moment of this wonderful movie. As an avid action fan, I couldn't help but be thrilled at Degurechaff's victories and dread her losses/missed opportunities. The story jumps right in without any recap, so it's best to watch the previous series, but let's be honest if you're here for this movie specifically you would've watched the series. The music and art are spectacular as always with the sounds always amped up for dramatic effect or quieted down to amplify the sense of death/not blow your ears out which I appreciate(a          
                              The only think I didn't like about this was that the CGI was at some points bad, but that's a common problem within most anime... just look at Dragon Ball Super: Broly.

222,"Joe Yabuki is a troubled youth, whose only solution to problems is throwing punches at them. What he lacks in manners and discipline, he makes up for with his self-taught fighting skills.

One day, while wandering the slums of Doya, Joe gets into a fight with the local gang. Although greatly outnumbered, he effortlessly defeats them, drawing the attention of Danpei Tange—a former boxing coach turned alcoholic. Seeing his potential, he offers to train Joe into Japan's greatest boxer. At first, Joe dismisses Danpei as a hopeless drunk; but after the trainer saves his life, he agrees to live with him and learn the art of boxing. Unfortunately, Joe's personality makes him an unruly student, and he often falls back to his old ways.

To survive the harsh world of his new career, Joe needs to trust his mentor and master the techniques taught to him. However, the road to becoming a professional boxer is rife with struggles that will test his mettle to the end.

In many ways, it does hold up as the benchmark that it is regarded as being - but in many other ways, it requires a ""good for its time"" disclaimer, as do many of its contemporaries.
                              Welcome to what I call one of the most epic animes ever. Try to imagine a Japanese version of Rocky, and this is what you get. But I say Rocky is the American version of Ashita no Joe since Rocky came out in 1976, and the original manga of Ashita no Joe started in 1968 and ended in 1975. But anyway, they share the same charms and are both iconic to their respective nations in their owns rights. The story is reasonably paced and easy to follow, and tells a life story about a young man&rsquo;s career and his struggles in and out of the

                              Warning! This review contains spoilers, so I recommend that you finish the first season before reading this review. 
                              I really wish I could recommend Ashita no Joe anime cause the manga’s story deserves to get a good adaptation and have more people experience it. Unfortunately, both as an adaptation and on it’s own show, AnJ is just bad.
                              Note 1: I am not english speaker
                              Script - Joe is that type of show that proves quality as timeless. How could it be for a story from the late 60s about a boxer become so important, poignant and meaningful to me in the long term? I have no idea, but I'm pretty sure Ikki Kajiwara knows that well enough to come up with one of the best sports tales ever known and that in my humble opinion wasn't surpassed ever since, at least not by any anime or manga. But what's Joe all about? It's about Joe, your not average underdog who's searching for meaning and is trained by an old          
                               How can I describe in words the very high qualities of this work of art, a classic of Japanese culture that until today, is a symbol of references and inspirations of its archetypes. The anime, Ashita no Joe, has a great quality in its characters, especially the main one, which starts out as a damn annoying youngster to a young man that you will definitely love for the rest of the play, not only in Joe (main) but in his other main ones too, having their development and charisma only lifted over time. Ashita no Joe also shows her technical side with regard to

                              Ashita no Joe is simple the best ''sports"" series
                              Ashita no Joe - The First Shonen Anime and the Best!
                              Ashita no Joe is a anime that aired in the 1970's and is arguably one of the founders of sports anime as a whole. But calling this series just a sports anime would not be doing it justice. While yes the story does mainly focus around Joe's boxing career, intermixed with this is fantastic drama, superb character development, and absolutely gripping suspense.
                              Joe is a classic boxing anime that started in spring 1970. It was made by Mushi Productions and directed by Osamu Dezaki. The show follows Yabuki Joe's road from a juvenile delinquent kid, all the way to becoming a pro boxer. Joe is a rude and quick tempered guy who is quick to get into fights. Joe packs a serious punch though, and this catches the eye of ex-boxer Tange Denpei who wants Joe to become a boxer. But because of Joe's troublesome nature he gets sent to juvie. There he meets boxer Rikiishi Tooru, who becomes Joe's rival. 
                              After completely binge watching 79 episodes of this boxing anime, I can say that it is a heart wrenching sports story. Never have I watched an anime where I started out hating the main character (Joe Yabuki) as much as I did and then find myself rooting for him. The development of Joe from when he first shows up in the Tokyo slums up until the very last moment of the show is a rare progression of a character if I have ever seen one. 
                              I'd like to preface this review by saying, I finished watching Ashita no Joe ages ago, quite literally the day before MAL went down so it wasn't until now I could write this review. I also recently bought the Tomorrow's Joe Blu-Ray and watched it as a refresher, so I remember everything pretty well. ",222

As new skills are developed and new alliances created, enemies from various teams—giants of high school basketball such as Yousen, Shuutoku and Touou—stand in the way of Seirin's steadfast attempts to get to the top. All of these schools prove to be formidable foes whose abilities progress exponentially, while Kuroko struggles to find a balance between his resolve to play as part of a team and his desire to win. 

With old wounds reopening, new challenges to face on the court, and a new set of foes—the ""Uncrowned Kings""—vowing to defeat the new hopefuls, will Seirin ever be able to achieve their dream of beating the Generation of Miracles?

                              The long awaited second season of Kuroko no Basuke- if you found the first season enjoyable, then I assure you... the second will not disappoint.
                               Kuroko no Basket is actually one of the most exciting sports anime I've watched so far, indeed, some people may say it like ""damn those characters can play fcking godly!"" for most kiseki no sedai players, but that's what makes the show more interesting right?
                              Sports have always been a popular topic for debate. Every game is different that shows new elements and surprises. Some of these include plays that will be memorable for years while other includes players that makes in impact in the business. In order to make an impact in basketball, one must have the passion and desire to not only win but play for everyone including themselves. The fundamental concept is that sports should also be played not just for competition but also to develop one’s own character. In Kuroko no Basket 2, we witness characters in a different light as they step up to the

                              Kuroko no Basket season 2 will not disappoint you in any way. It is as good as season 1 and in some aspects one may claim that it is better.
                              Kuroko no Basket Season 2 continued right where Season 1 left off, and in fact, the entire story got even better. The basketball matches became even more exciting with the addition of ""the zone"" and there was more basketball action instead of character development/chatting. But there were even more characters to enjoy watching. Kuroko no Basket Season 2 was all in all so much fun!

                              This is one of, if not, the best shounen sports anime I’ve ever seen. Sports anime that are based around American sports, can often fall into the category of being comically poor representations of the sport they’re portraying. KuroBasu has already established itself as being a show that, while dramatized, still offers an informed view of how basketball actually works. The 2nd season of the show continues to build on a strong foundation of the first season, adds compelling dimensions to the characters, and an ever increasing intensity in the games.
                              I enjoyed watching KNB season 1, but season 2 was a great disappointment.
                              Kuroko No Basket season 2 is the best out of all the seasons. It has Kagami vs Aomine the most exciting match ever, and it featured both teams at full power. Shows a little bit more character development to Murakibara, the Aomine hype is still there but not as much anymore. It has excitement, character development, and intense AF matches. It has the most exciting breathtaking matches out of the three seasons, and I felt like the characters improved the most in this season. Certain characters like Himuro have been introduced and he fits in the story really well, plus Aomine vs Kagami in the

                              I never thought I would like Kuroko no Basket. I am a lazy teenage girl, sport just isn't my thing, and yet here I am completely hooked on this anime that revolves around sport - I've found myself rewatching matches over and over and I went as far as to read the whole manga in a day because I couldn't wait for the next episodes to come out.

This special episode is not for someone who is completely new to the anime (contrary to the title). This is for those who have watched this show in its entirety. And it will spoil a lot, if you were to watch this show. 
                              The whole episode is somewhat satisfying I rated it as 9. For me, the overall aesthetic of the narrative and phasing are a bit abrupt, but the sequencing of events are on point and so the story for the whole series became clearer/ clean.
