0,"""In order for something to be obtained, something of equal value must be lost.""

Alchemy is bound by this Law of Equivalent Exchange—something the young brothers Edward and Alphonse Elric only realize after attempting human transmutation: the one forbidden act of alchemy. They pay a terrible price for their transgression—Edward loses his left leg, Alphonse his physical body. It is only by the desperate sacrifice of Edward's right arm that he is able to affix Alphonse's soul to a suit of armor. Devastated and alone, it is the hope that they would both eventually return to their original bodies that gives Edward the inspiration to obtain metal limbs called ""automail"" and become a state alchemist, the Fullmetal Alchemist.

Three years of searching later, the brothers seek the Philosopher's Stone, a mythical relic that allows an alchemist to overcome the Law of Equivalent Exchange. Even with military allies Colonel Roy Mustang, Lieutenant Riza Hawkeye, and Lieutenant Colonel Maes Hughes on their side, the brothers find themselves caught up in a nationwide conspiracy that leads them not only to the true nature of the elusive Philosopher's Stone, but their country's murky history as well. In between finding a serial killer and racing against time, Edward and Alphonse must ask themselves if what they are doing will make them human again... or take away their humanity.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",9.19,9,1,3,2262683,184889,"                              Adaptations have long been a thorn in the side of anime viewers, but not because they are inherently bad. No, the main problem has been that many studios have regarded the original work almost as an afterthought, and there are a number of shows that could have been wonderful if the writers had simply stuck to the original story.
                              Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood gets an immense amount of praise in the MAL community, is the #1 ranked show and is constantly referred to as a masterpiece and the greatest show ever created. I've seen many fans preach about how ""it lives up to the hype"" and ""can never receive too much praise"". Now this is just the opinion of one guy. I'm certainly not the law of the land or anything. However, I personally feel as though calling FMA:B a masterpiece and the champion of all shows is a bit of a stretch. That's not to say that I didn't enjoy it or that it          
                              Overview:
                              Since I couldn't find any legitimate objective analysis in any of these fanboy reviews, I decided put my own review: 
                              I can't even watch the original FMA anime now that I'm currently watching Brotherhood! This is a NO FILLER anime it gets straight to the point with it's beautiful animation and amazing portrayal of the manga, everything is so different! Emotions are strong and there's more of a connection between characters then in the original anime, you immediately get dragged into this show within the first 5 minuets, this is honestly one of the most spectacular anime's i've ever laid my eyes on, it's definitely one of the best new shows of the last couple years. Its a definite watch, don't miss out!          
                              Now, this is a prime example of how to adapt an manga into an anime the RIGHT way.  The original Fullmetal Alchemist, though well made and very popular, went into a downward spiral as soon as it diverted from the manga storyline and never seemed to recover.  This however, shows that instead of trying to add their own story elements when adapting manga/visual novels etc., sometimes anime producers should just sit back and retell the great story that has already been written in the original.
                              ""We're not gods, we're only human. We can't even save a little girl, so what good are we?""-Edward Elric
                              If one wishes to obtain something, something of equal value must be given, that is the law of equivalent exchange, the basis of all alchemy, the law that governs the world of Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood.

                              Why do people give this such a high rating!
                              One of my favorite anime of all time!
                              I have followed both the anime and manga of FMA for years, simultaneously. The first anime adaptation was satisfactory, but left a bad aftertaste.
                              There isn't much more I could say with all the praise it already has, but I truly believe that Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood deserves every bit of it.
                              I'm going to be completely honest here... this is my favorite anime I have ever seen. Why you ask? Simple: (besides a few irritations) there is nothing wrong with this show.
                              Ah, Fullmetal Alchemist, what an amazing ride through the world of alchemy, I'm not surprised at all it is #1 on MAL, since it also is, and probably will be, at least for a long time, #1 on my list.",0

                              Shingeki no Kyojin, ''mistranslated'' as Attack on Titan, actual translation The Attack Titan. But could it mean both? Or could it hide even more meanings behind the ''Shingeki''? Shingeki no Kyojin is amazing starting from the name, and the how the meaning of  ''Shingeki no'' changes throughout the series. This has amazed me, after all never before have i seen a series with the meaning of it's name changing throughout the series.
                              Attack on Titan is probably one of the most overrated animes of all times, and to be honest, I had high expectations about this series. Before I continue, this review will cover the series from its beginning up until this point, with few minor spoilers.
                              To think that season one of Attack on Titan aired in 2013, and that I have had the pleasure of following the series since that time is something that makes me feel a great amount of pride. 
                              Oh boy, Attack On Titan is on it’s final stages. This time with a new Studio, and that Studio is MAPPA. Well let’s get straight to the review.
                              This is one of the masterpiece anime ever made, has the best storyline and the song is very epico.
                              Attack on Titan or Shingeki no Kyojin, a name which is very popular among fellow Anime watchers.

                              Shingeki is one of the many overrated shounen anime out there and I can summarize my review with one sentence: „If you became kinda interested in Shingeki , because you have heard it’s so much more than just a shounen, don’t believe it, because it is exactly that, just another shounen."" Now I’m not a fan of shounen, and if you read this review you will find out why, so this anime is not made for me, but just for more diversity in views I will analyze this anime a bit closer.
                              Well Guys this is my very first review, I wanted to start reviewing this show as soon as it comes. I'm a loyal SnK anime fan, I somehow managed to keep myself from reading the Damn Manga and avoid (maximum) spoilers. When I heared that WIT Studio is no more animating the series, I was really afraid of a sequel that's gonna end up like Nanatsu no Taizai by studio Deen, But when They announced that the final season will be released by MAPPA I was kinda relieved. Even if they changed the original character design to make it resemble more to Isayama's Artstyle.
                              Attack on titan season 4 is on its fourth episode so my opinion can change.So far I feel as if the season is following the source material the manga pretty well.It just depends how well Mappa can pull it off since the 3D titans are throwing people off.On the other hand though season 4 accelerates to a whole other level and there's a lot of new characters and good story which introuduces more understanding on titans, the rest of the world, and Erens new goal.Though it starts off with a 4 year time skip in which a lot has changed (in my opinion for the          
                              Attack On Titan is probaly one of the biggest anime out there besides Death Note or Naruto. And this season will be the end of the anime. Its sad indeed but what do I think of the first four episodes and is it still as good as the other seasons?Or better?",1
2,"Seeking to restore humanity's diminishing hope, the Survey Corps embark on a mission to retake Wall Maria, where the battle against the merciless ""Titans"" takes the stage once again.

Returning to the tattered Shiganshina District that was once his home, Eren Yeager and the Corps find the town oddly unoccupied by Titans. Even after the outer gate is plugged, they strangely encounter no opposition. The mission progresses smoothly until Armin Arlert, highly suspicious of the enemy's absence, discovers distressing signs of a potential scheme against them. 

Shingeki no Kyojin Season 3 Part 2 follows Eren as he vows to take back everything that was once his. Alongside him, the Survey Corps strive—through countless sacrifices—to carve a path towards victory and uncover the secrets locked away in the Yeager family's basement.

                              *Minimum Spoiler Review*
                              Attack on Titan is the face of anime. It exploded onto the scene in 2013 with popularity unmatched by any other anime. No other anime has left as titanic of an impact as this one. It's the anime that introduces many newcomers into the medium. Many with no exposure to anime whatsoever have still heard of or even watched Attack on Titan. So it's only appropriate that it would be great, because that's what should be expected from what is essentially the representative of all anime. And for me, every season leading up to this one has met these high standards and been great.
                              [Spoiler Warning]
                              Season 3 Part 2 excels in presenting an engaging storyline that ties many of the mysteries of the previous seasons. It also manages to immediately grabs the viewer's attention as it displays the battle deciding humanity's fate in its full glory.
                              Attack on Titan, the franchise that made a huge impact in the anime industry once again proves itself capable of carrying the torch. Before watching this part 2, I confess that the announcement of 10 episodes was slightly worrying. I approached this season with a bit of trepidation even with some of the jaw dropping cinematic trailers. Truth to be told, Attack on Titan has a lost some hype over the years but still manages to maintain a strong fan base. It’s for that reason and its many successes that we’re getting part 2. 
                              After years and years of foreshadowing, teasing and promising great things, Attack on Titan is back and ready to reveal its mysteries. Was it worth the wait though?
                              I do not think I can ever give a 10/10 as quickly as I can for Part 2 of Season 3 of Attack on Titan. It has set the new standard for adaptations. Isayama's master storytelling, the exquisite soundtrack by Sawano, the emotional tight rope the studio had us walk throughout, the sweat-inducing action, and the perfection of the voice cast. Everything in this season has been fine tuned, and the end result is one of the greatest animated feats that I have ever had the pleasure of watching. 
                              This is the arc I think a lot of people were waiting for. The one with lots of answers. Seen folks complain for years about all the questions introduced with no immediate answers and I've seen endless memes about Eren never getting to that basement. Well we're here, we made it all the way to the sea even. But that's not enough. I think that's what Eren means at the end there, that they thought the sea would grant them freedom but in they search for freedom they only discovered that there's so much more out there. Like finally opening a door and then seeing          
                              Many people have anticipated the manga to be animated and when the wildfire spread all over the place in 2013, people were gushing over it. The popularity grew dramatically and along the way caused controversies as to whether it had become overrated. After watching the first 3 seasons, it is not. It never failed to deliver what Attack on Titan really is. So, what about this part of season 3? It still holds well. Whether you are a newcomer or a die-hard fan, you must admit that this is one of the best anime in a long time.
                              When last year Season 3 was declared to be split cour there was a considerable sadness among the fans because of the delay.But it actually came as a blessing in disguise.This season had probably the highest anticipation till now and it goes without saying there was lot of expectation and honestly WIT Studio was able to deliver it.Whether they will pick up SNK again or not is not clear at this point but this season will probably be their best work for a long time.
                              *minor spoilers*
                              I feel bad for people who dropped this show. 
                              Don’t be so surprised when you see a whole stream of 10/10s come gushing from the reviewers who have just finished this piece of work. SnK Season 3 Part 2 is really, nothing short of breathtaking. It’s that one anime that actually makes you crave the next episode after the next, as the madman himself, Hajime Isayama leaves you awestruck with his storytelling. Why has such a typical looking shounen series risen to the 2nd place, in all of MyAnimeList? If you have not watched such a rare gem of this caliber (that may never appear in the next 5 years) yet, I suppose I          
                              A lot of bombs dropped this second half of the season. The story has finally kicked into high gear. Twists and turns and revelations seemingly dropped every episode. The plot moved beyond the threat of regular titans to the threat of the true enemy outside of the walls. We're finally starting to understand who Reiner, Bertholdt, Annie, and Zeke are. The society they belong to, where they are coming coming from, the reasons behind the attacks, and the titan origin story are some of the questions that answers were given to.",2

                              Gintama and Godly both start with G, coincidence? This anime is the pure essence of entertainment. You will laugh, you will cry, you will become emotional invested in a variety of ways. Not having watched this anime is like missing out on a classic movie and that means that you haven't fully lived yet. I watch an episode every night before I go to sleep so that I can sleep in pure comfort and relaxation. Watching Gintama for me is not a hobby. It is a life style. I HIGHLY recommend this show to anyone who likes anime and especially comedies.

                              its nearly one year since the second season of Gintama has started and the loyal fans can remember the Joy and the life it gave us back then when it was aired again.the story that once was supposed to be about an school for demon dispellers and then about the Shinsengumi finally turned into something bizzare called Gintama which u can say is the Golden Work of Hideaki Sorachi.
                              GINTAMA 2012  !!!!!!! and its HD 
                              Gintama is in 16:9! Honestly, that is a genuine improvement in this season of Gintama as well as the animation. The look of this season was so much nicer than the first season, of course, since it's newer. 
                              This is my first review and i'm not really that good with writing in English. But I'll do my best.
                              My favorite Anime of all time because it has all i ever wanted.
                              There is something that nobody talks about in gintama. Even though it's one of, if not the most important detail that most people can't seem to be able to accept.
                              Gintama is the most hilarious series I’ve ever seen in my more than a decade of watching animes and reading mangas. It is number one on my top lists of best animes in comedy and in the top ten on my hundred lists of best animes in the history of anime world. So when I learned that they are coming back, I was more than delighted, I was so thankful for the whole production who decided to bring them back.
                              I've heard of this anime for a long time, but never got into it because there's so many episodes and I didn't want to start from the beginning...So I jumped into Season 6. After watching a few episodes, including the classics within Season 6, I asked myself ""What took me so long to get into Gintama!?""
                              I really like the weirdness, randomness, and epic (I would like to put ness there but there is no word epicness. Hahaha) of Hideaki Sorachi. 
                              I've seen many anime videos and movies and etc, and Gintama has to be one of those I could re-watch over and over again!

                              Overview:
                              Read All First! / SPOILERS*: (Im sorry if you don't agree, but this is my Review)
                              Everyone in the world is distinctive, each person having both positive and negative aspects about them, and every society is known for their own distinctive features. There are those who disagree with this view as nothing more than a blind and false generalization, and there are those who completely agree with it. Both ways of thinking, in my opinion, are unnecessarily exaggerated. The best solution for this is a balance, as we cannot hide one society’s trait, nor can we realistically say that a whole society belongs to a certain feature. For example, Japanese people are considered to be people who love a clean environment,          
                              This is gonna be in Spanish and in English. I'll add the translation below, explaining why I put the ""low"" rating.
                              I didn't like A Silent Voice as much as I would have liked to. The storyline had so much potential but failed to step out of boundaries. Expressing issues like suicide, mental illnesses, and bullying is a challenge through a movie, but no matter what the mediocre plot remained. I am surprised that it is rated so highly, and I think it's because of the main storyline that everyone loves it so much, but here's why I rated it so low.
                              I don't like this movie. If you do, that's great! I'm only writing this to warn people who, like me, might find this movie to be a waste of their time, and not to say anything negative about the fans of this movie.
                              some people say ""I love you"" is the hardest word to ever say to someone... but is that really true? is it that hard to say? in my case it is hard yes, but not the hardest. have you ever thought of the word ""I'm sorry""? I'm not talking of the ""easy"" ""I'm sorry"" i'm talking about the ""I'm sorry"" that comes from the bottom of your heart, the expression of your true feelings, being completely sorry, regretful, that word that burns inside you like hell... now, that's really REALLY hard to say.
                              A Silent Voice is a beautiful looking filmーlike most of Kyoto Animation’s productions. The artistic direction was on point, but that aspect of this creation doesn’t make up for the poorly constructed story. The story is about a bully making amends for beating and antagonizing a deaf girl as a child. 
                              I was lucky enough to catch the very first screening of Koe no Katachi in Singapore's cinemas on March 9, 2017. This is also my first review, so please bear with me if my review layout is not great.
                              Like any other slice-of-life anime, the plot is relatively simple, however there is an outstanding attention to the development of the characters.",9

The Yorozuya is soon approached by Nobume Imai and two members of the Kiheitai, who explain that the Harusame pirates have turned against 7th Division Captain Kamui and their former ally Takasugi. The Kiheitai present Gintoki with a job: find Takasugi, who has been missing since his ship was ambushed in a Harusame raid. Nobume also makes a stunning revelation regarding the Tendoushuu, a secret organization pulling the strings of numerous factions, and their leader Utsuro, the shadowy figure with an uncanny resemblance to Gintoki's former teacher.

When we talk about Gintama we mostly talk about its gag part but what I like more are the story like arcs with humor and not all gag arc which seems like a filler. This season focused on that very aspect. This season of Gintama has a nice story line with each episode explaining many plot holes like why people call Katsura zura (No it is not some plain nickname, it has meaning behind it), why did Yoshida Shouyo suddenly become his beloved students enemy and it          
                              Gintama is slowly coming to its end, sadly it isn't ending on a high note. With this season of Gintama the focus of the anime is moving towards ending its overarching story line which means each episode is more serious and focused on the action and backstory over what is in my opinion Gintama's biggest strength in the first place, Comedy.
                              When you think of Gintama, you think of its comedy and what it's known for. As like its previous season, Gintama has started to throw most of the comedy out the window in order to finish the story and thus its franchise as a whole. However, doing this is not a good thing, and in this season it is quite apparent. When you compare this to the previous one—while only being 12 episodes to 51—the dip in quality is really apparent. Would it have been better if it was more than 12 episodes? Yes, and maybe not. It would have had more time to bring

                              Can someone fill me in on why this season is boring to some people? Is it because it's a main story arc and there's no traditional, Gintama comedy? Does that make people butthurt? I thought this season was phenomenal. It took insane strides in character development and story development, and all of it was interesting to watch.

                              Gintama review 
                              Having now watched the main tv seasons of Gintama where do I rate this one...
                              While others argue this season is one of the worser ones of the Gintama seasons, I disagree. The only thing I can agree with, is that the art of the new season isn't as a good as in previous ones but that alone isn't enough to make it go down to a lower score. Another reason others say this season was a dip in quality was due to the lack of comedy, thus ""losing its franchise as a whole"" but that's bullshit. Although yes, Gintama is definitely a comedy series and generally doesn't have so many serious arc in a row, doesn't mean that this          
                              So we got 12 linear episodes of gintama, were they good or not, we'll see.
                              They made this season way too short. 12 episodes is nothing to what fans are used to. We want 30-50 episode seasons with fillers and lots of laughs - not just the cliche main story arc we all knew was coming with a joke thrown in here and there. Overall this season was way too short and way too serious. If nothing else is clear about this last season it is that we are approaching the end of another great anime and they no longer have the time or no longer want to take the time to make it as fun as it was in          
                              Are you kidding me? I think, this season is the most epic season in anime history. I love to see gintoki in battle scenes and action. yes, gintama may be a comedy-themed anime, but isn't it great to watch the stories of the characters? and they only did this in 12 episodes. Didn't all those fight scenes, sensuality and everything in 12 episodes make the anime even more spectacular? I'm sure if Gintama had been such an anime from the beginning, it would have been the number one in action anime. sorachi wants to tell us with this series ""I can write a story like          
                              I have to say that this is my first time walking away from a Gintama season not completely blown away by it.  In fact, I would say that this was the weakest Gintama season of them all.  But, because its Gintama, even though it was weak for its own standard, it still made for an entertaining anime.   
                              (This review applies to the entire Gintama series.)
                              This was a deception for me, Gintama is my favorite anime and even if this season was not ""bad"" it was bad in comparison to the other seasons.",10

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.96,8,13,84,919514,62347,"                              Recently I had the absolute pleasure of watching Clannad: After Story.  I had previously seen the original Clannad and liked it as a light-hearted slice of life anime, good but not amazing.  I went into After Story expecting the same thing, but what I got was something fantastically different.
                              Emotions are a powerful thing; they have the capability to override any modicum of rationality and force even the ficklest of beings to succumb to their emotional disposition. Due to this, often times, those of us who claim ourselves to be critics of various mediums fall short of our own expectations. “Clannad After Story”, a series described as “life-changing” by many is the perfect suspect; a production that captured the hearts of the majority that viewed it while instantly becoming a classic within its genre. Littered with subpar designed moe characters, irrelevant arcs, contradictory elements, forced plot devices, and a plethora of other obvious issues,          
                              *Yet another successful heart warming series produced by Kyoto Animation that surpasses its predecessor.*
                              The original series, the highly rated ""Clannad"", was one painful viewing experience for me - not because it's full of tragic tales, but because of how dire it is. Female characters sugary enough to induce diabetes in a lump of rock, combined with atrociously forced ""drama"" fast tracked it to a lofty position on my ""Overrated Shite"" list. And yet its ratings pales in comparison to that of its sequel, ""Clannad: After Story"".
                              ""Do you like this school? I really, really love it. But nothing can stay unchanged. Fun things... Happy things... They can't all possibly stay unchanged. Even so, can you keep on loving this place?"" 
                              After watching many anime and reading many manga, I would recommend Clannad AS to most people just as strongly as when I first finished it. (I cry to it just as much too.) What sets After Story apart for me is the encompassing world it develops in addition to the main story. The completeness of the narrative is beautiful and rare, since many other media products of our time give up on telling a complete story for a variety of reasons. A plethora of stories are all told at once for the imaginative viewer who appreciates all of the series' nuances. Without spoilers, by the          
                              **SPOILER FREE REVIEW**
                              To be frank, I despised the first season with a passion. For the life of me I couldn’t understand what was so great about it. Yet I still saw the fandom of Clannad everywhere; from the forums to it being favourited on every other profile. I promised to stay away from ~After Story~ after witnessing the fail or rather mediocrity of Clannad. However, seeing the rage of it rising faster and louder with it being currently ranked #1 on the site I caved. Like a kid being peer pressured into smoking I reluctantly watched it. And I’m glad I did. 
                              If a work of fiction drags its audience into the depths of hell with tragedy, does it retain its artistic merit if the entire experience is nullified by the conclusion?
                              ~After Story~ is an anime that touches people's souls. I watched it, and was blown away. This was just less than a year ago.
                              Clannad caught me off guard last year being incredibly different from its predecessors, Air and Kanon 2006. There wasn't so much focus on a story as there was just following the school life of main characters Nagisa and Tomoya, as well as all their friends. When Clannad ended, Clannad After Story was announced. After Story not only guarantees its like its predecessors, but does so in a way that almost makes it excessive and, in the end, shameful. Though this may be the case, After Story is still a superior follow-up to the first season, following a more structured storyline, deepening characters, and still portraying          
                              Clannad ~After Story~ Review
                              Magical, one of a kind beauty, executed and told in the most emotional way. Extremely unique and fascinating character development lead through life with its ups and downs. Realistic and tragic tale of love, life and living. A story which has lot to say and even more to offer. Life goes on, people change, but some things always stay the same. Or.. do they?
                              So it has finally come to this. As I'd watched this anime I felt compelled to review it, heck I've done it in my head many times over. Every time I had a new thought, realization that made it greater in my mind. The reason for doing this is most likely that Clannad succeeded in amplifying every single story arc, making it feel grand, perfect and complete. It was around halfway into After Story that I'd realized I am in way over my head. This does not deserve to be dissected and reviewed like some faulty piece of garbage. No sir.

                              Fair warning: this review contains MAJOR spoilers of basically the entire movie. First off, it's a movie that has taken people by storm, so I'm sure that if you want to watch it, you already have by now. If that's not the case, I recommend you exit off of this review immediately. You've been warned.
                              Before watching this movie, I must say I was pretty hyped as lots of my friends recommended it and it took the #1 spot on MAL. However, I have to admit I am quite disappointed in the end and here's why:
                              	Ever since I was a child, I wanted to be an author. I’d write for days on end, using every ounce of my imagination, and then stored my works away in some secret drawer when I finished. Frightened to death of sneers and condescending laughter, I rarely shared my writings with anyone, only submitting them to a contest or two over the years. A couple of months ago, I heard that there was going to be a prestigious writer’s conference, known as Books Alive, in my town, where literary agents would search high and low for the next great author. Despite having a small amount          
                              With ""Your Name"" storming up to MAL's top, I had to check it out for myself and experience this phenomenon, that has a score of 9,40 out of 10 at the time of writing. 
                               Makoto Shinkai never fails to frustrate me. His works have tremendous potential, yet they all inevitably end up as shallow exercises in romantic drama that are pretty to look at and not much else. With the release of Kimi no Na wa. I was very skeptical if any of that had changed. It released to the top of multiple anime lists seemingly over night and I figured it would be 5 Centimeters Per Second 2.0, but maybe, just maybe, Shinkai would break away from his old patterns and surprise me.

[Written by MAL Rewrite] ",8.87,8,19,122,736067,12958,"                              Like many other people, I initially wasn't attracted to Haikyuu. Seeing clips and hearing about anime such as Free made me think that Haikyuu too would be another fanservice sports anime. I was surprised, however, to find that I immensely enjoyed Haikyuu. Haikyuu is by no means my favorite anime, but it is the anime that I have become the most attached to.
                              Given the monumental amount of hype that Haikyuu seems to have within its own fan base, I hope that this review will not come across as more negative than I intended it to, so I would just like to start by saying that Haikyuu is for sure one of the better traditional sports anime I have seen, but even so it is still far from perfect.
                              “You are only an amazing ace if you can create a miracle.” 
                              The match point is finally here. You’re the one to take the first step in securing the final point. You start your way to behind the serving line. Your whole body is warmed up, but somehow your hands are still ice-cold, initiated by the sheer thought of failing in this crucial moment. The pressure is immense, yet you still don’t waste a thought on not giving your all. If you make that one more point you’ll win the match. Just one more point and all your hard work will be rewarded. Amidst that thought, you toss the ball in the air and set off for          
                              (Review got removed because it was updated to completion ;-; gotta make the climb back)
                              I take it back, I take it all back. I originally wrote a review during the season where I was of the opinion that this season was lacking compared to the first two. Still good, but not as great story wise. Well I just watched the final episode and hours later I'm still an emotional wreck.
                              Story: In this third installment of Haikyuu, the anime continues to follow the events of the manga with no significant changes. This season centers on the finals arc against Shiratorizawa, a powerhouse school known for its tall, strong, and talented players and has consistently represented the Miyagi prefecture in the National Spring Tournament.
                              Lord... since its premiere I must have watched and re-watched this season's Haikyuu!! for 20 times now and I am always mesmerized-- not only by its magnificence, but also by its timelessness.
                              Only a word for descript this Third season; Tsukishima!!! 
                              This season of Haikyuu was consistent in terms of the qualities Haikyuu has presented so far.
                              This anime will get you pumped .... Idk why people rate it with 6/7 ....
                              I'm not a big fan of sports anime.. At least it was what i thought. I was really skeptical when i began to see Haikyuu, but now, i'm very glad i watched it. It's like if a hidden passion for sports anime has awakened inside me, and Haikyuu is in the top of it. I don't know if this third season is the best; it's actually hard to choose just one season; to me, each one of them has its qualities, and they're equally outstanding.
                              Haikyuu!! Season 3
                              If your looking for a sports anime with character development this is the place! you can see the personal struggle each character is having and want to root for them when they do good and feel bad for the when they do bad. This show puts you behind the eyes of each character and being able to witness the struggles they face when up against a powerful foe. The conflict between characters is displayed beautifully and the way they battle it out is shown like no other. For both sides of the net you can feel the drive these characters have. In the end its          
                              This is my first review so i would like to start by saying that normally i dont write reviews no matter how great the anime but this anime really drew me in. This anime is probably one of the best if not the best sports anime i have ever seen the story was superb as if you see making a 10 episode anime of a single match is simply extraordinary. ",17

                              What makes a show good? Is it the story’s ability of positing a revolutionary concept or to delve into deep unprecedented philosophical topics and tackle uncharted themes and ideas? Or, maybe it’s the unique characters present that imbue the show with relatability and separate it from the rest? This season of Mob Psycho 100 has me thinking otherwise. Mob Psycho takes themes like self-identity, comradery, uniqueness and blends them into a tale that I will not soon forget. Mob Psycho tackles the aforementioned themes in a way that most of its predecessors have failed to do. This has me believing that in order to fabricate

Whether it’s a book, manga, video game, TV show, or anime, there’s probably one thing out there we all want to experience all over again for the first time. Mob Psycho 100 Season 2 is one of those things. 
                              Mob Psycho 100 II follows in the footsteps of its antecedent in having terrible comedy, uninteresting battles, and fatuous characters.  Mob-kun is essentially a younger, non-bald version of Saitama with none of the “charming” qualities that would allow the viewer to become engrossed with his various escapades.  Situational comedy typically originates from Mob’s lack of self-awareness, in conjunction with the manipulative nature of the self-proclaimed “Greatest Psychic of the 21st Century” (i.e. Arataka Reigen) who frequently employs “special moves” that are intended to be hilarious, but, more often than not, are puerile absurdities that involve copious amounts of — hypertension-inducing — sodium chloride.

                              It rarely happens that second season of any anime tops the first season but its not the case with the Mob Psycho 100, because its clearly improves over 1st season artistically and story-wise too. 
                              It's taken quite a while to sit down and write my thoughts on Mob Psycho 100 II. For the longest time, I've been trapped in this limbo of not wanting to write but never finding anything remotely close to my perspective being represented. It's as if no one has any of the same problems I have with this season, therefore I’ve yet to find someone disappointed in it for any of the same reasons as me. As such, this review is born more out of a place to satisfy myself and bring peace to my perspective than anything I’ve written thus far. Keeping a measured          
                              Like you, I was waiting for the unknown entity seen in the ""????!!!%"" state in Season 1 to somehow be expatiated upon and it wasn't. This season was incredibly unsatisfying and lost it's reputation of breaking tropes and instead made the decision to follow every single Shounen trope. No ground breaking themes or events in this season, sadly.
                              If you are coming back to the second of Mob Psycho to once again experience the series, then I do have great news for you. It's maintained the level of quality it has presented in Season 1 and it has continued to develop on the themes it has been presenting so far. If you were satisfied in the past by Mob Psycho, it is very unlikely that this season of Mob Psycho is gonna be any different. If you're on the opposite side of the spectrum, I haven't seen Mob Psycho change its approach in any way that would cause someone to consider the series          
                              If you thought Mob Season 1 was a 10/10 like I did, prepare to view a 20/10. Everything about this season dwarfs the original season. Everything that was good in it has been multiplied to an insane level I never thought was possible. The Art and Animation reach new peaks, the soundtrack and overall sound design totally immerse and treat the ear to a delightful, emotion-evoking experience. The story continues with similar and entirely new themes in an insanely powerful way. The characters continue to evolve and grow while still retaining what we all loved about them. It's truly one of the best anime, or          
                              Ok, so I'm pretty sure I'm in the minority here so before I start this review let me just say that I very much enjoyed the second season of MP II. I rate a 7 due to the fact that it was not as interesting compared to the first season. More specifically, it had a certain charm that stems a lot from the dynamic between Reagan and Mob. Where the first season had an extremely good flow to it, most of the story this season feels more episodic. 
                              As is the case with sequels of critically-acclaimed and popular anime, Mob Psycho's second season was among the most anticipated anime of 2019, with lots of hype being built even before it aired. Many claim that the second managed to actually surpass the first one by leagues, praising the character development and the plot's shift to more dramatic and slice-of-life elements.
                              A few years prior to the 2nd season of Mob Psycho 100, this series was relatively unknown. One Punch Man - once a goofy webcomic drawn in the charmingly childish style of ONE - was masterfully redrawn by the accomplished mangaka Yusuke Murata, and not long after an explosive anime adaptation from Madhouse introduced the world to the works of ONE.

21,"After helping revive the legendary vampire Kiss-shot Acerola-orion Heart-under-blade, Koyomi Araragi has become a vampire himself and her servant. Kiss-shot is certain she can turn him back into a human, but only once regaining her full power. 

Araragi has hunted down the three vampire hunters that defeated Kiss-shot and retrieved her limbs to return her to full strength. However, now that Araragi has almost accomplished what he’s been fighting for this whole time, he has to consider if this is what he really wants. Once he revives this powerful immortal vampire, there is no telling what she might do, and there would be no way of stopping her.

But there is more to the story that Araragi doesn’t understand. If a newborn vampire like him could defeat the hunters, how did they overpower Kiss-shot? Can he trust her to turn him back to a human? And how is that even possible in the first place?

Araragi is at his limit but he must come to a decision, and it may not be possible to resolve this situation without doing something he’ll regret…

                              I had the opportunity to view this film in theaters. This film exceeded my expectations. The previous 2 films were, unfortunately, unable to stand alone. Out of the two, this was the most action-packed and climactic. I was continuously blown away by the excellent sound direction and animation. Like most Shaft anime, the last Kizumonogatari film has an avant garde method of storytelling. It might seem strange, but it works for the tone and comedy of the anime. Random clips pop out and sometimes seem disjointed, however they only add to the amazing animation. There was one scene in particular that had everyone in the

                              Kizumono 3 answered questions that surfaced in the first and second installments. It also lessened my disdain for some of the objectives that were displayed in the previous films, particularly in regard to Guillotinecutter and his crew. After one last major surprise, Kiss Shot is returned to her final form. Her attitude has reverted to that of her 8-10 year old incarnation in the first film; cheerful, carefree and seemingly generous. Of course, her impression will appear differently to others. this is only my opinion and I admit, I didn't care for her person in Nekketsu. Araragis growth as a vampire and as a young

                              I'm just gonna review all three Kizu movies here if you don't mind.
                              While Part II showed the descent of Araragi into a vampire, Part III showed the descent of Araragi as a character. He oscillates between the comfort of being led and self pity without remorse. After frolicking about with the vampire in an extended montage, Araragi realizes that his rescue would be responsible for human deaths when she feeds, then resolves to commit suicide to make up for... absolutely nothing but self-satisfaction. Rather, he conflates his humanity (e.g. ethics) for his human life, thinking that somehow the utility scales would balance after he exits the scene. The pity-fest continues until the end of the movie, interrupted          
                              Ive seen monogatari series from the season 1 and all the movies and mini series/side arcs. Shaft doing really good job in making this series interesting if not for them i'd definetely alrdy dropped this series long time ago, definetely will give 9 score to the main arc bakemonogatari and nisemonogatari and 7-8 score for some of the side arcs.

                              Wow, really wow. All the Kizumonogatari movie are outstanding!
                              At the time of writing this Kizumonogatari III is one of only two Anime's that I have rated a 10. It is very rare that I rate anything a 10 because I don't believe any movie/show is perfect. And this is no exception, it isn't perfect. However, the roller coaster of emotions and the astounding journey I was unexpectedly taken on took my breath away. Everything all the way down to the ending credits song I thought was perfectly placed and fit the vibe of the movie really well.
                              Kizumonogatari III is good, but not as good as I was expecting. Kizumonogatari II is better by leaps and bounds, but Kizumonogatari III is better than Kizumonogatari I.

With Earth as the main battleground in this interplanetary war, Utsuro's master plan to destroy the planet—and himself—is nearly complete.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.81,8,25,1154,129216,1081,"                              Gintama is an anime franchise with several seasons end more of 350 episodes. This season follow the events Shogun Assassination Arc, Farewell, Shinsengumi Arc and Rakuyou Decisive Battle Arc, adapting the Silver Soul Arc.
                              Reading the other reviews posted here, and guessing that people watching this have already watched all previous seasons of Gintama; this will be a short review pointing out the worst things of this season.
                              Well, it’s the beginning of the end. The real end, the one we never expected after all the hoaxes and fakes but knew nonetheless would have to come eventually. 
                              I was sort of modest with my rating of this season because I really did enjoy it, but it was a little bit slow so I hedged and went with a nine. 
                              The Silver Soul arc brings an amazing blend of comedy and action, never seen before in Gintama. One moment your in a fight and the next you are laughing your ass off. 
                              I might not be a fan of Gintama, but I would be lying if I said that this season wasn't pretty damn good.
                              *This review is spoiler free
                              The final arcs keep rolling along! Let's see... of course the story is more gripping now than ever before. We are finally seeing some questions from way back in season 1 really being fleshed out and answered. The world (especially Edo) is in more trouble than ever before. Etc. Etc.
                              This anime accelerated right as the shogun assassination arc started. Boy, it has been a journey and each episode was a joy to watch. Gintama's comedy and humour is overtaken by the more serious silver soul arc, but that is fine with me- it's still filled with its fair share of touching moments and well-animated fight scenes. 
                              (This review applies to the entire Gintama series.)
                              After a decade and two years of initial broadcast of the Gintama franchise, the time has come for the final arc. As like its previous seasons, Gintama has started to throw most of the comedy out of the window in order to finish the story and thus its franchise as well. However, the current season is something that is a bit different. Why? and How? The season is more funny compared to the previous one which is the Slip Arc (where Shinpachi is forced to shout in every scenes like it is being overused thus making the season unfunny). Moreover, the story started when the          
                              If you've got this far..... You just know that this final season is going to be epic!  Upon writing this, I do have to come to the realisation that this is the end of the road. The reality is that I'll never see another show that encapsulates so much energy and passion. People may call me out on that, but what Gintama has brought to many viewers is the hilarious, well- written comedy sketches as well as the painful, yet heartwrenching arcs throughout the years. ",23
25,"Even after having risen to the utmost rank of shun'ichi, Yotaro struggles to find his own identity in the world of rakugo. Caught between his master's teachings and the late Sukeroku's unique style, his performance lacks an important ingredient—ego. And while his popularity packs the theaters, he is but one of the few; rakugo is under threat of being eclipsed.

Meanwhile Yakumo, regarded by many as the last bastion of preserving the popularity of rakugo, struggles to cope with his elderly state. Even though his performances are still stellar, he fears that he is nearing his limits. His doubts grow stronger as an old friend creeps ever closer. Konatsu, for her part, attempts to raise her son as a single mother, which Yotaro is heavily opposed to. Instead, he seeks to persuade her to marry him and in turn raise her son as his own.

In Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu: Sukeroku Futatabi-hen, the curtains fall on Yotaro and Yakumo's story, tasked with restoring the near-obsolete art form as well as overcoming their internal conflicts.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.78,8,29,1059,141211,2639,"                              The second season of Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu cemented the series as an undeniable masterpiece for me is what I wish I would be saying right now. However the second season lost a lot of the aspects that made the first season of Rakugo great for me.
                              Not only is this show not up to par in comparison to it's predecessor, but simply wouldn't be worth your time or consideration without it's lineage. 
                              When something moves you to tears, it's daunting to explain why. How can I possibly put into words how much of an emotional impact a single piece of media had on me? All I can do is try and hope that you decide to give it a chance.
                              Nostalgia is a powerful thing. Happiness is essential, for when death comes, we want to look back fondly at our lives. It's only natural, really. It's only natural that we feel this way, and it's only natural that this is the conclusion to such a wonderful work of art. With that sentimental tangent, back on track, though expect that to be the tone of this review. Death, or rather, actually dying and no longer being able to experience anything for all of eternity is something that legitimately frightens me, and it has since childhood. Leaving a legacy that you won't see, possibly not even knowing          
                              Coming off the highly acclaimed and one of the best anime of 2016, Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu, comes it's second season and it's... I don't really know to describe how good this is, but that's just how good it is..If that makes sense. It's light, It's beautiful, It's haunting, It's deep, It's dramatic. It's one of the most masterfully made anime there is. 
                              I never thought will give this series 10/10 score at first, after read it sypno I tought it will become a mediocore anime, but it turnout I found a masterpiece instead. And that shock me to found one in ""New Generation"" anime which is I expected full of mediocore.
                              The first season of Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu was personally my favorite anime of 2016. It was such a breath of fresh air for the slice-of-life genre with its traditional period drama setting that inevitably clashes with the modernization of society. Who would have thought that something like rakugo can hold such power when it comes to crafting mesmerizing narratives? Personally, I would’ve found it boring when I get to see a performance live. However, the show executes this art of storytelling so well that it never fails to catch my attention. The way it shows the perspective of the audience and the storyteller in          
                              Holy shit this anime is a fucking masterpiece. I'm not trying to be a hypebeast right now when I say that this anime is truly superb. The characters are treated extremely well and given ample space and time to grow and develop, the plot it interesting and plays out effectively, and the storytelling combined with the soundtrack combine to suck you in episode after episode to care about performances of an esoteric art that most watchers won't know about at the beginning but will love by the end. Goddamn. I came into this show with high expectations after the first season (which I gave a          
                              The first season of Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu was the absolute best anime of Winter, 2016, and very possibly the best anime of that entire year. It was certainly the most moving, truly adult, drama I've seen in a long time. Appropriately enough, since rakugo is the art of storytelling, the first season took the form of a story within a story, telling an incredibly moving tale of a complicated friendship, tragic choices, and the repercussions of those actions for people living in the present day. It was haunting, memorable, and it's been a very, very long year waiting for the sequel.
                              I am going to take a risky side with this review: Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu: Sukeroku Futabi-hen was disappointing. The atmosphere and the seriousness vibe was completely shakened by the new main character, which I thought was actually for the worse.
                              This isn't Rakugo, or at least this isn't the Rakugo that I knew. Descending Stories is weird and different. It constantly pushes a new idea for a show that worked so flawlessly. There's no way that I wouldn't doubt it. I was careful with approaching each new episode, gave it a chance after chance until I realized that I'm just being ridiculous and that it's exactly how it's supposed to be.
                              I don’t like Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinju. Main reason being is that the main characters’ stupidity is what caused the conflicts within the show. Right off the bat, the main focus of both arcs, Yakumo, is so fickle-minded. Come to think of it, he’s the indirect cause of Miyokichi and Sukeroku death. Now I don’t know if what he and Sukeroku had was just bromance or if he actually had feelings for him. Or if he just wants to focus on doing rakugo. But if he just manned up and dumped Miyokichi, then she could’ve just moved on with her life. But nope, he just

                              Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu is the first anime that I have been passionate enough about to write a review on MAL. I am no good at reviewing things but here it is:",25

Monogatari Series: Second Season revolves around these individuals and their struggle to overcome the darkness that is rapidly approaching. A new semester has begun and with graduation looming over Araragi, he must quickly decide the paths he will walk, as well as the relationships and friends that he'll save. But as strange events begin to unfold, Araragi is nowhere to be found, and a vicious tiger apparition has appeared in his absence. Hanekawa has become its target, and she must fend for herself—or bow to the creature's perspective on the feebleness of humanity.

                              Since the release of Bakemonogatari, the first part of Monogatari series, this unique show has been splitting the community in two parts, one side being the Monogatari fans, like myself, who threat it like a rare philosophical gem of the anime universe, and the other side which sees it as just another harem show that tries to cover the fanservice with some 'random' philosophy.
                              Even though it’s been over half a year since I saw this anime, on impulse I decided that it was about time I said a few words about it, because I feel like I almost never see anyone ever talking about the “other” side of Monogatari and the quite clear problems the show has.
                              To live in a world with apparitions, what danger will Araragi face?
                              Shaft and Nisio Isin are like peanut butter and jelly. Both are good on their own, but together, they compliment each other with such perfect synergy to form something truly amazing. They both have their own unique quirks and styles that really come together in the best way. Isin's stories are character driven, and Monogatari is no exception. Shaft has a way of injecting so much life and personality into all his characters. You instantly fall in love with each character's personality, from Hachikuji's playful insults and Kaiki's snark and cynicism. This is especially important because of the focus on character and perspective in Season          
                              Sequels to any body of work have a reputation to uphold; a certain quality it must meet to please its viewers that are eager for the return of their favorite characters and stories. This is especially the case with this little nugget of a series here.
                              After watching Nisemonogatari and Nekomonogatari: Kuro, I really thought that the future Monogatari series will never live up to Bakemonogatari and will not be as good as Bake. That's not the case though because Monogatari Series: Second Season completely blew my expectations and it was miles better than Bakemonogatari.
                              Favorite Monogatari season by far. Deep and complex character interactions(Kaiki-Senjougahara, Nadeko-Kaiki, Hachikuji-Araragi etc),most interesting stories, strong feelings and heartwarming momments.  Nekomonogatari white, second and final part of nekomonogatari completes Hanekawa's arc in the best way. I find Hanekawa's personality kind of annoying and her gimmick doesnt help her so much but in this story she presented another aspect of her essence and i find it pretty interesting and loveable. In other hand her co-competitor, Senjougahara remains a character with a difficult personality who doesnt know how to comunicate and all her act seems fake 
                              Answers a lot of questions left from the first season...
                              Brilliant! Probably the most interesting Monogatari season to date! They made many references and built upon subtle clues from the original seasons that just fascinated me. There was a ton of dialogue as well as character development that made me question who was the real protagonist of the story. The ending was a masterpiece and completely unexpected. This season was long 26 episodes, but made me crave more nonetheless. I cannot wait for more Monogatari content to be released~
                              Monogatari Series: Second Season is the continuation of the series right after the events of Nisemonogatari. As a watcher of the previous seasons of Monogatari. I am happy to say that SHAFT continues to bring out its beautiful art style which is joined by its use of sound to create a strange but unique story in the anime.

                              This show is definitely one of the most unique out there, and luckily, really good. 
                              I've just finish watching this 26 episode anime, I ain't gonna fuck around and just present it the way it is. Oh and btw this an edited version.......3rd time co'z them ....you know who,  orders me to do it.
                                    Bakemonogatari is easily one of the best anime I have ever watched, that being said I expect great things from every new season. This season really let me down. I mean where was Araragi the whole season? Nadeko kind of just became the most pathetic type of yandere ever. The Hanekawa arc was such a bland and boring way to start the season.

While preparing to perform surgery on someone, he gets a call from the hospital director telling him to switch patients and instead perform life-saving brain surgery on a famous performer. His fellow doctors, fiancée, and the hospital director applaud his accomplishment; but because of the switch, a poor immigrant worker is dead, causing Dr. Tenma to have a crisis of conscience.

So when a similar situation arises, Dr. Tenma stands his ground and chooses to perform surgery on the young boy Johan Liebert instead of the town's mayor. Unfortunately, this choice leads to serious ramifications for Dr. Tenma—losing his social standing being one of them. However, with the mysterious death of the director and two other doctors, Dr. Tenma's position is restored. With no evidence to convict him, he is released and goes on to attain the position of hospital director. 

Nine years later when Dr. Tenma saves the life of a criminal, his past comes back to haunt him—once again, he comes face to face with the monster he operated on. He must now embark on a quest of pursuit to make amends for the havoc spread by the one he saved.

                              If you've heard of Monster, then odds are you've probably heard of the incredible hype surrounding it. For a while, Monster has been the absolute critic's darling of anime, being the poster-boy for lofty intellectual types. Because of this, it can be very easy to imagine Monster as being overhyped.
                              Monster is an anime that I used to scoff at every time I saw high ratings for it. I was never really into long plot driven anime and I couldn't understand how so many people loved it, but seeing the ratings, I couldn't help but be interested. I downloaded this anime over a year ago and burned it on to 3 DVDs, never really intending to watch it.

I'm going to say some harsh things in this review, but even if you think my word is the gospel, you should still watch the first few episodes of the show. And remember, a 6 is not a bad score. I did not dislike this anime at all. 
                              Monster is an anime that has lofty aspirations and does not come close to fulfilling them. It starts out fairly exciting, but it turns into an endless menagerie of typical psychological anime bullshitting that pretends to be meaningful and significant, yet ultimately says patently obvious things and never imparts any meaning at all. I cannot stress strongly enough that from about episode 40 on this anime is horrendously slow (it is probably a 7-8 level for the first 24-26 episodes, which is why I kept watching, hoping it could somehow salvage itself).
                              The writer Naoki Urasawa has a distinctive way of weaving stories, and he is one of the most capable writers when it comes to creating an element of mystery. His secret is that he knows exactly how much information is appropriate for each event, and when he should move from one event to another, so much so that he is able to take the viewer from an important and interesting event without showing it, to a completely shattered event without losing the viewer’s interest at following the story, and this is a difficult way of writing to achieve. Most writers only use it once in          
                              I never write reviews for anime that I watch, but given the ludicrously high weighted average score for Monster I feel obligated.
                              Note: Quick Review on bottom of this review
                              You know one thing that pisses me off? When something that takes itself super seriously is fucking stupid. Where to begin? Monster is already overlong as a comic, so for Madhouse to decide and stretch it even thinner boggles my mind. I thought they'd fix some blatant plot-holes and dumb shit, but for the worst of reasons they decided to remain faithful. A story that constantly tells you shit but shows you barely anything. A villain that is constantly augmented but whose supposed terrifying nature is never demonstrated. Suggestion only works if you don't shove it in people's faces. It also works better through visual          
                              ~Story~
                              Monster is a compelling Psychological, Mystery, Drama that is heavily driven by its thrilling story. Some who watch this may not be able to get into it but the rest will enjoy the experience.
                              ""Monster"" may not be the most popular of anime - unlike say, ""Death Note"" or ""Full Metal Alchemist"", there are still plenty of people who haven't seen it - but it has attained this almost mythical status as one of the anime that's come closest to being flawless. Could this really be the Holy Grail of anime? Now, being the opinionated jackass that I am, I've never shied away from obnoxiously airing my unwanted views loudly and with extreme prejudice, however controversial they may be, and a fair share of popular anime (""FLCL"", ""Elfen Lied"" and ""Clannad"" to name a few) have felt the wrath          
                              Monster is a good anime with a great story, but it had way to many little problems that just piled up, eventually destroying the actual enjoyability of the show.
                              Monster is a series that sets a very big standard for mystery anime. It was written by Naoki Urasawa and many praise it as the better Death note. I had the pleasure of watching this anime and here are my thoughts.
                              You lock eyes with a girl at a party. Soon, you're talking. A few hours later you find yourself in her room, making out with her. You start to reach for a boob when.... ""I don't want to take it any farther than this."" Just when you thought you were about to get something, you get shut down, cockteased. ",28
29,"Ghostly, primordial beings known as Mushi continue to cause mysterious changes in the lives of humans. The travelling Mushishi, Ginko, persists in trying to set right the strange and unsettling situations he encounters. Time loops, living shadows, and telepathy are among the overt effects of interference from Mushi, but more subtle symptoms that take years to be noticed also rouse Ginko's concern as he passes from village to village.

Through circumstance, Ginko has become an arbiter, determining which Mushi are blessings and which are curses. But the lines that he seeks to draw are subjective. Some of his patients would rather exercise their new powers until they are utterly consumed by them; others desperately strive to rid themselves of afflictions which are in fact protecting their lives from devastation. Those who cross paths with Mushi must learn to accept seemingly impossible consequences for their actions, and heal wounds they did not know they had. Otherwise, they risk meeting with fates beyond their comprehension.

                              It's a bit difficult to write about a series that has been hailed as one of the anime industry's greats. The first season was an atmospheric work of art, an enrapturing experience that sent chills down my spine with the end of every episode. But I'm not entirely sure that Mushishi's second season has necessarily lived up to those memories. It's still an excellent anime, and while it is better than almost anything that has come out in the past few years, there's this constant sense that something - just something - is missing. 
                              As understood by most sensible viewers that dissect the content they watch, anime, throughout the years, has become an expressive form of art in its own way. It's a medium that utilizes and relies heavily on audiovisuals in accompaniment with a script to bring a story to life; a story that takes on new impressions and interpretations depending on the creative choices taken up by those involved. Sometimes this art is used as a vehicle to service self-indulgent shows, and other times, it's used for something that's worth its salt. Regardless of the quality of the title, or the effort on the part of the          
                              ""Mushishi"" - perhaps one of the greatest anime I've ever seen. ""Masterpiece,"" as corny as it may sound, is the first word that comes to mind -- and not only regarding the second half of the second season, but regarding the entire franchise as a whole. There is, however, a catch: Mushishi is the kind of series that practically defines the phrase ""not for everyone.""
                              Ginko smokes it out while thinking about what to do.  Instead of making real choices he lets the creature in the forest come to him as he continues to smoke.  He smokes some more as he seems confident that he can smoke through just about anything.  As the never ending blunt between Ginko's mouth continues to burn, the story picks up through out the season.  You will get the urge to smoke throughout this anime.  I suggest smoking the entire you watch this good tale of how to smoke as you find whatever it is you are looking for.           
                              before you'll start reading this review i'll say that i've never written one before but i feel i need to write one because to many people overlook this hidden gem.
                              I'm gonna do my best to find new words to say about Mushishi in this review that I haven't gone over in the past, but let's just get into it and see what happens.
                              This is an example of a truly remarkable and artistic masterpiece for the anime, and perhaps entertainment world in general. 
                              Mushishi Zoku Shou season 2, or as it truly is, Mushishi season 3, steps in, giving us more of what has made so many love the Mushishi-universe.

It has its ups and downs, the ups being the final three episodes, and the downs being the rest of the season. Only the final three episodes provide any sense of progression, be it for the characters or for the plot. Ishigami’s long awaited character arc was freaking fantastic, but the same can’t be said about the other characters'.

                              Once upon a time, not that long ago, an old producer of Sunrise founded an animation studio. This studio made some decent anime and some people of the anime community adored this studio. The only sadness in this studio's lifespan was that its bosses wished for a hit but did not have one. One summer day, this studio started to air an anime called ""Sword Art Online"" and it became a great hit over all the world. After that, this studio made a lot of money thanks to Sword Art Online's success and started to make more and more anime with this great amount of

                              This show is like my migraines.
                              This season; the boy won't be raised; the cutes lack the hows; Chika doesn't dance.

                              Kaguya Sama s2 is everything that we got in season 1, but 100x better. Simply put, it’s one of the best adaptations I’ve ever seen. 
                              [SPOILER WARNING]
                              I wasn’t a big fan of Kaguya-sama in the first season. While I thought it was good, it had some flaws, probably because the author, Aka Akasaka was not on par with his writing, trying different things. He quickly dropped the rip-off Death Note way of thinking for a sweet classic rom-com, way more effective towards the end of season 1. 
                              The first season of Kaguya-sama: Love is War was a breakout success. With its over the top direction and comedy along with its cast of well-rounded characters with amazing chemistry, the show became easily one of A-1 Pictures’ best works. On top of that, it was helmed by an acclaimed director of Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu, Shinichi Omata. Not only did he return for a second season, but the show would be adapting material manga fans consider to generally be better than what the first 12 episodes covered. With such lofty expectations, it’s difficult to see how a show would really top itself, at least

Countless brave individuals, known as Divers, have sought to solve these mysteries of the Abyss, fearlessly descending into its darkest realms. The best and bravest of the Divers, the White Whistles, are hailed as legends by those who remain on the surface.

Riko, daughter of the missing White Whistle Lyza the Annihilator, aspires to become like her mother and explore the furthest reaches of the Abyss. However, just a novice Red Whistle herself, she is only permitted to roam its most upper layer. Even so, Riko has a chance encounter with a mysterious robot with the appearance of an ordinary young boy. She comes to name him Reg, and he has no recollection of the events preceding his discovery. Certain that the technology to create Reg must come from deep within the Abyss, the two decide to venture forth into the chasm to recover his memories and see the bottom of the great pit with their own eyes. However, they know not of the harsh reality that is the true existence of the Abyss.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.74,8,34,95,870251,30619,"                              Made in Abyss isn't at all what it appears to be. Though it may seem little more than an adventurous children's anime, chibi art and all, it gradually reveals itself as something much darker, as Riko's and Reg's hopeless ascent continues, stumbles along, no happy ending in sight, death— and worse— awaiting them for each step they fall.
                              I want to be honest. I was evading this anime and manga. My first impression was the picture of Riko, Regu, and Nanachi, I thought: An anime about children, with some strange plot, fanservice and maybe a big bunny. I was not expecting anything from this anime. I was preparing to skip and to ""bury"" it in a review, but now I can eat my own words. This anime is a jewel. The adaptation is incredible. It has a good narrative with an impressive artistic design, combined with the most beautiful soundtrack of the year and an acceptable character development.
                              It's been a long time since I saw an anime which manages to immediately get you captivated as much as Made in Abyss did. At first glance it might look like a kids' show of sorts, but you really couldn't be much further from the truth. This is a pretty dark anime past a certain point, but even before that it's still fantastic.
                              Welcome to the most overhyped show of 2017. Made in Abyss is a perfect example of an above average show that gets hyped up by every body which forces others into believing that the show is something it really isn't. I, for a change, am not blinded by ""hype"", and can see the flaws in Made in Abyss, which are quite numerous.
                              Made in Abyss aired in the Summer season of 2017 and ran for 13 episodes; the last occupying a double time slot. It's about children who delve into a great chasm called ""The Abyss"" in order to find treasures to sell in order for their village to profit. The protagonists embark on a quest to find information about the main girl's mother.
                              On a first sight Made in Abyss does not sound too bad. A girl named Riko is about to be killed by a giant beast when an amnesiac robot pops up and saves her. One thing leads to another and soon she is thrown into the mysterious hell pit. The setup is very interesting and very well done. The stakes and goals are immediately established, make sense, and make you want to know more. I got amazed by how well we were introduced to the main plot, and how good was writing in those episodes. Everything looked so fresh and different from any fantasy show          
                              I am only writing this review in light of the fact that other reviewers are giving the show 9 or 10 across the board. 
                              The Abyss is a true wonder. It is the curiosity that draws us in and leads us to our inevitable metamorphosis that comes from growing up.
                              Open up an endless world of possible settings. A Giant hole in the middle of civilization, in which lies a gigantic hole dangerous to mankind. What could it be? How does it work? What lies within it?
                              I think this series is incredibly overlooked and very overhyped at the same time.
                              I’ve always had a fascination for fictional stories about fantasy adventures that adds a bit of survival horror to the mix. The type that stick to my memories the most are those that follows a journey to the unknown. As such, Made in Abyss came as no exception when I discovered this adaptation. It’s a show bringing in mystique that captivated me from start to finish. An anime like Made in Abyss takes on an approach with dynamic emotions to heart and it’s really an anime that people shouldn’t miss out.
                              Lost destiny, power at a price, the tolls of exploration. That is what goes on to drive them, to lead destiny forward to a world behind comprehension. That is.... the Abyss. 
                              They actually tried.
                              You can't say shows featuring a combination of lolis, furries and traps are all shit anymore because of this amazing adaptation of an exceptional manga. Bummer, innit?

                              This series is overrated. It peaked my interest when I saw it on the front page at the highest rated anime on this site. I thought to myself this was worth a watch, I definitely won't be disappointed since the top rated anime here pretty much deserve to be there. How wrong was I.

                              TL;DR A not unenjoyable series with some fantastic musical performances, that unfortunately suffers from forced drama, shallow characters, a drawn out, surprisingly predictable story & a tendency to have characters talk at length about what the music being played expresses rather than let us listen & hear it for ourselves. If you're looking for a tearjerker that will do everything short of poke you in the eye to get those tears flowing, Your Lie in April (YliA) might be for you. If you're looking for something more, you might want tosearch elsewhere.

Beneath a full moon, a young boy witnesses the murder of the bandits who had enslaved him, and is then christened with a new name by the man who rescued him. This boy is Shinta, now known as Kenshin Himura, and he is destined to become a swordsman. The softness of his heart does not befit the occupation, but his desire to protect the innocent is absolute.

Rurouni Kenshin: Meiji Kenkaku Romantan - Tsuioku-hen details the origins of the man who would bear the name of Hitokiri Battousai long before he swore his oath not to kill and before he earned his reputation as an assassin. The young man's heart is divided between justice and corruption, while the fate of a nation rests on his actions.

                              Surprising though it may be, it’s really incredibly rare to find a samurai anime that is actually good. As far as the samurai genre goes, Akira Kurosawa pretty much closed the book with 1954’s “Seven Samurai” and since then, is seems as if whenever anyone attempts to tackle the genre, there exists a mysterious force that compels them to strip away any and all sense of authenticity and add in superpowers, vampires, aliens, or hip-hop (not that that is necessarily a bad thing but it certainly gets tiresome). That’s one of the reasons why Rurouni Kenshin: Tsuiokuhen is so refreshing, it daringly tackles the story          
                              Battle shonen has always been a genre that is mostly frowned upon by the Anime community. Many fans tend to disregard most of the shows in that particular genre as something that is both unrealistic and imitative of one another. Add in to the fact that samurai Anime in particular always miss the point when it comes to their narrative, from the unnecessary hip hop style found in Samurai Champloo, to the redundant, hit and miss comedy that is prevalent throughout Gintama’s long run – it fails to work most of the time and it’s not hard to see why it does so. That is          
                              The word masterpiece is used too much these days.. I haven't seen anything that deserves that title as much as Rurouni Kenshin: Tsuiokuhen. While the original Rurouni Kenshin is meant as a typical shounen (comedy, action, a bit of romance?), this is a serious historical drama. Those words might turn you off, but you'll be surprised how well it is done: never is Tsuiokuhen truly slowpaced, never will the action be disappointing, never will the animation cease to amaze you. And the music. Ah, the music. Taku Iwasaki at his best.
                              Throughout the past decades, japanese history and culture is often portrayed in various mediums, in particular that of movies which often take place in the last two centuries of Japan's history. This era is characterised by a slow shift from feudal traditions to the modernization brought from the west, being the transition from the Edo period to the Meiji period, also known as the japanese revolution in 1868, of importance in this case. Rurouni Kenshin: Meiji Kenkaku Romantan - Tsuiokuhen narrates the tale of Himura Kenshin's past and his struggle with his own beliefs against the harsh reality he faced. It is truly a masterpiece,          
                              There's a part of me that wonders if this review is even necessary. Whenever I have a discussion with someone about ""great"" anime--not the ""funniest"" anime, not the ""saddest"" anime, not the best ""action"" anime, but anime that breaks boundaries and defies classifications--this OVA is mentioned without fail. Being a little late to the party, I first saw this five or six years ago; having watched Rurouni Kenshin on English television as a child, and later rewatching a subbed release, my interest was piqued when I heard that there was an OVA in the franchise that was intelligently scripted and intended for more mature audiences.          
                              All I have to say is that this is a must see for fans of the series. Even though this serves as a prequel, I would not recommend this to people who have not yet seen the TV series because the tone and style is completely different and will probably give you the wrong set of expectations for the TV series which always implements humor. While in this OAV, it’s flat out drama and full of tragedy, and none of the comedic moments of what defined the TV series is present. But does it negate the quality of this OAV? Certainly not. The pacing is          
                              Rurouni Kenshin: Tsuiokuhen is a great film (which I will classify it as throughout this review, for all intensive purposes) because of the respect that it has for its audience. Throughout the work's two hour running length there are countless opportunities presented that could've allowed for the story to introduce twists and to attempt to shock the viewer, but instead, the turns that are taken in the final quarter of the production are foreshadowed early on, and are often revealed to the viewer before they are revealed to the protagonist, Kenshin Himura.
                              Overview:
                              This OVA restored my faith in RK animation. I hate the second set of OVAs and find the TV series just too childish for my liking, but this gem has it all. It's more serious than the anime, but isn't pointless emo tragicrap like the last OVA. 
                              I figured it was about time I posted a review on one of my favorite anime of all time. Samurai X: Tsuiokuhen (Trust and Betrayal) is a masterpiece of an OVA, and the prequel to the Rurouni Kenshin anime series.
                              Samurai X: Turst/Betrayal is not like a lot of other animes. It doesn't stress swift justice, and eye for an eye sort of justice, but rather a way to live one's life (and it tells what happened to Kenshin before the series). It deals with how war can affect someone's life and the realization (looking at the story close enough) that your inner peace is where you must start if you really want to create a better world for you and others. I don't remember who said this, but someone once said, &quot;Be the change you want to see,&quot; which is what Kenshin realized. Kenshin          
                              The story created by Nobuhiro Watsuki in 1997, about the repentant killer of his past, gains new features in Rurouni Kenshin's Roe, which tells his character's bloody trajectory before his life as a wanderer.
                              This was a great series (if you could call four OVA's a series).  If I could give it a 9.5, I would.  It was fantastic, only lacking something that made my jaw completely drop, which is why I just couldn't quite give it a 10.  Totally worth watching and I would recommend this to anyone, though be immediately warned, there is a ton of blood and it can get pretty graphic (the opening of the first episode is actually as bad as it gets in terms of gruesome violence, so if can get through that, you should be good).
                              I'll be honest here. I'm not a big fan of romanticized, revisionist historical animation. And when I mean romanticized; I mean to the fullest extent of the word and any other derivation of its definition. ",35
36,"Following their participation at the Inter-High, the Karasuno High School volleyball team attempts to refocus their efforts, aiming to conquer the Spring tournament instead. 

When they receive an invitation from long-standing rival Nekoma High, Karasuno agrees to take part in a large training camp alongside many notable volleyball teams in Tokyo and even some national level players. By playing with some of the toughest teams in Japan, they hope not only to sharpen their skills, but also come up with new attacks that would strengthen them. Moreover, Hinata and Kageyama attempt to devise a more powerful weapon, one that could possibly break the sturdiest of blocks. 

Facing what may be their last chance at victory before the senior players graduate, the members of Karasuno's volleyball team must learn to settle their differences and train harder than ever if they hope to overcome formidable opponents old and new—including their archrival Aoba Jousai and its world-class setter Tooru Oikawa.

Therefore, to truly differentiate one show from other similar shows, scriptwriters need to engage the audience in a remarkably new and refreshing way.
                              The sports genre..  if you're not a fan of it then it can't be helped but GODDAMN how much you're missing out. Most people don't start watching anime with the sports genre and even when they dive deeper into the vast sea of anime genres, it is one that usually is missed out.
                              This review comes from someone who actually plays volleyball, so my opinion is god ;)
                              “La semplicità è la suprema sofisticazione” or, in english, ""Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication"", one of my favorite quotes from Leonardo Da Vinci.
                              Just one more point. You take a deep breath in, trying to truncate the overwhelming anxiety infiltrating your own body. Your pulse quickens and your mouth feels like gritty sandpaper, all while trying to keep your body from collapsing out of sheer exhaustion. The raucous cheering from the crowd serves as nothing but a muffled backdrop to the sound of your intensifying heartbeat.
                              Haikyuu's second season continues with its excellent high-quality storytelling that made many fall in love with the first season. While Haikyuu is most certainly a sports anime at its core, it's also an extremely well-crafted tale of the trials and hard work that every player goes through. Most importantly, Haikyuu makes you actually care about what happens in the show. Whether it's a loss or a victory, Hinata or a player on the opposing school's volleyball team, the show manages to grasp us as viewers and force us to invest heavily in the fictional world of Haikyuu.
                              To Whom It May Concern: The following review will be an unbiased, honest & systematic review that's just to the point. I will refrain from spoilers to the best of my ability. This critical review is mainly intended for people wondering whether to watch the second season since they finished first or for newcomers who are for some odd reason wants to start this anime for second. Please don't be the latter. 
                              The second season of the Haikyuu!! surpasses the first one by having more creative “funny” moments, longer screen time for the secondary characters, and impressive plot/character development. I’m sure many of us watch anime out of enjoyment but having an anime that is motivating & inspirational will eventually leave a deeper impact — I’ve started running after watching Hinata and Kageyama run during practice, no jokes. 
                              To be honest at first i dont like volleyball that much but when i gave haikyuu!! a try it seriously made me want to watch it more. so here's my review. This is my opinion so you dont have to argue with me. XD
                              Story: After their bitter defeat against Aoba Johsai, the team carries on through training with the same determination. A summer camp filled with new and strong opponents becomes the catalyst for Karasuno's evolution. When the evolution is complete, Karasuno forges ahead to the Spring High with the same goal as always-to go to nationals. 
                              Before we begin, I'd like it to be known that this series of Haikyū! (ハイキュー!) has been highlighted as my favorite show for quite a long time. How exactly is this a big deal? Despite the ratings that I give to almost every anime being generous, I would have to say that this one is well worthy of the rating-scale at 10. There comes too of the saying that I am, in actuality, a very meticulous person when it comes down to watching a show; I'd prefer the shows that I've watched to be meaningful, containing some underlying message that may be served as a          
                              The “second season” for a lot of anime series tends to bring out amazing set-pieces, better story progression as well as the fact that, since the show was successful in the first place, the viewers would love to see more of it. Haikyuu: Second Season is a hidden gem that I loved for the first season, but this second season especially, for the first 13 episode and beyond held a special place in my heart because it was this show during Fall of 2015 that literally brought me back up to speed in terms of my education and just real life struggles. The mental impact

It was sold out in advance with huge waiting list and it was clearly visible by the TOHO Cinemas Roppogi Hills where I was pleased to see this movie. Every available seat was taken and queue was HUGE. 
                              Story isn't everything.
                              If you didn't like the anime series, won't like this either. 
                              I watched the movie in cinema yesterday.
                              There might be spoilers, 
                              To those who says the story is generic, they need to understand its not the whole story but a part of it. This anime is one of the greatest in the history of anime which is proven true by its success, those who still deny I would tell them to look at the milestones it has already crossed.
                              i watched the movie today. I feel it was one of the best shonen anime movie i have ever watched. 
                              This is my first review if i say any wrong i apologize, [This review contains spoilers]
                              Overrated, Overrated ,Overrated. I kept hearing this and tbh I had no expectations of demon slayer movie. But.. I was wronge.

                              I'm not a big fan of the Kimetsu no Yaiba, but my friends are.
                              Finally, this movie was released in my country (in Asia) since last weekend, and surprisingly, almost all the reaction/review for it are very positive from both fan and non-fan/just casual movie goers.
                              Let's start with the negative first. The film itself lasts almost 2 hours, and there are 2 villains. One of them is useless, and seriously because not only does that one villain have no role but the whole part with him is completely unnecessary and in no way contributes to the development of the story. In addition, too much time was wasted here to suggest that the things that happen to the main characters are used for their character development, which did not happen. There’s also the classic problem of many shonen stories, and that’s bad writing of villains and by that I mean both,          
                              When i first saw the news, saying this movie has surpassed Spirited Away and became the no 1 top grossing film in japan, i just couldn't believe it.
                              SO I just watched this anime yesterday with subtitles, and I must say this movie far exceeded my expectations by a big margin, and kudos to ufotable for making such a masterpiece, and Honestly in my opinion they took it to the next level on this one, most of you guys remember ep19 of the original anime series, but I swear they took it they the whole new level, where I can't imagine how will they make something more better than this, this is the pinnacle of the animtions style, quality, and good story execution, they literally made a simple arc in the manga a          ",38

Its the most powerful and thought provoking of all his films. It also communicates a message very differently since it has much darker overtones than his other lighthearted films. While they may be enjoyable and powerful in their own way they can never be compared to the stature of this film. I hold this one higher than the quality of Spirited Away. Which in my opinion is then most overrated Miyazaki/anime film. This is the one film that Miyazaki completed perfectly because it gave you that feeling that

                              For each new Studio Ghibli film I watch, I just get more and more convinced that they are the best animation movie studio out there. Princess Mononoke is by no means an exception.
                              Princess Mononoke was released in Japan on 1997. It is a Studio Ghibli film, written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki, and it is his seventh feature film. Having seen some of Miyazaki's best works, I can safely tell you, without any hesitation, that this is his second best movie. 
                              First off, I LOVE Hayao Miyazaki and a lot of his movies. I fell in love with Studio Ghibli’s artwork, music, and pretty much anything about them. This is one of my all time favorite movies in fact. Just the story line is so beautiful about how man and nature are supposed to live side by side but when one fights against the other, there can be both misunderstandings and consequences. The story is open to interpretation but it feels like a timeless tale. A lot of times, I found myself believing that he could have made the story in this time frame and it          
                              Ah, Princess Mononoke. It was one of the most earlier films, and anime in general, that I watched, and was captivated at first sight.

41,"Young Thorfinn grew up listening to the stories of old sailors that had traveled the ocean and reached the place of legend, Vinland. It's said to be warm and fertile, a place where there would be no need for fighting—not at all like the frozen village in Iceland where he was born, and certainly not like his current life as a mercenary. War is his home now. Though his father once told him, ""You have no enemies, nobody does. There is nobody who it's okay to hurt,"" as he grew, Thorfinn knew that nothing was further from the truth.

The war between England and the Danes grows worse with each passing year. Death has become commonplace, and the viking mercenaries are loving every moment of it. Allying with either side will cause a massive swing in the balance of power, and the vikings are happy to make names for themselves and take any spoils they earn along the way. Among the chaos, Thorfinn must take his revenge and kill Askeladd, the man who murdered his father. The only paradise for the vikings, it seems, is the era of war and death that rages on.

                              If Don LaFonaine narrated Vinland Saga from the start, he’d begin the show with “In a world….” In Vinland Saga, we are introduced to a Viking world, a world of historical fiction rich with culture and testing the limits of survival. Based on the manga of the same name, it’s a show that teaches more than about survival. If you’re ready to embark on this epic adventure, then be ready for a 24-episode saga like you’ve never experienced before.
                              There is a profound feeling to Vinland Saga. Whether or not the events depicted are entirely accurate, you are watching monumental history unfold. Although it is frustrating at times, it's gripping in the end. 
                              The following will be more of a critique, rather than a review, so expect a lot of spoilers.
                              Greetings ladies and gentlemen, I will cut straight to the point. 
                              The first arc of Vinland Saga has been touted as one of manga’s greatest prologues. As such, many were curious about how well the anime would fare. While it may seem like a mere revenge story at first, this 24-episode series acts as a GAR infused yet slow-burning meditation on vengeance and war, as well as the thrills and horrors that await. Moreover, it's a character study revolving around the arc's main protagonists: Thorfinn and Askeladd. They make up the tragic backbone of the show, and that backbone is powerful enough to cement this show as one of the best of the year.

42,"Twenty-two-year-old Eikichi Onizuka—ex-biker gang leader, conqueror of Shonan, and virgin—has a dream: to become the greatest high school teacher in all of Japan. This isn't because of a passion for teaching, but because he wants a loving teenage wife when he's old and gray. Still, for a perverted, greedy, and lazy delinquent, there is more to Onizuka than meets the eye. So when he lands a job as the homeroom teacher of the Class 3-4 at the prestigious Holy Forest Academy—despite suplexing the Vice Principal—all of his talents are put to the test, as this class is particularly infamous.

Due to their utter contempt for all teachers, the class' students use psychological warfare to mentally break any new homeroom teacher they get, forcing them to quit and leave school. However, Onizuka isn't your average teacher, and he's ready for any challenge in his way.

Bullying, suicide, and sexual harassment are just a few of the issues his students face daily. By tackling the roots of their problems, Onizuka supports them with his unpredictable and unconventional methods—even if it means jumping off a building to save a suicidal child. Thanks to his eccentric charm and fun-loving nature, Class 3-4 slowly learns just how enjoyable school can be when you're the pupils of the Great Teacher Onizuka.

It basically fails on both fronts. Plot points and devices are reused to the point where they become dull, and they get increasingly ridiculous as the series progresses. Not in a good way, of course. Holy melodrama, batman! This anime is chock full of bullshit backstories that are supposed to make us go “awwwwww, they’re not a bad guy/girl after all!” by the way. Yeah, it’s definitely as irritating and ineffective as it sounds. 
                              Eikichi Onizuka. 22 years old. Even as Japan keeps turning out more new anime, there’s still perfectly good series out there from the past, and that’s especially true for people who might have been introduced to anime just recently. It’s hard to believe that GTO will be 10 years old this June, but age has nothing to do with a good anime. So I’ve devoted the last few days of my life to this series.
                              I finished this series a while back but i was bored so i decided to write this..
                              Great Teacher Onizuka... heheh and what a great teacher he is. A really original and good anime filled with comedy, action, and a few serious moments, an animation that has given life to one of the most memorable characters i've seen, Onizuka Eichi.

                              Animation - 7
                              While I usually steer away from ecchi anime, this an anime I will ALWAYS  make an exception for. Yeah, the art is dated, and the dubbing is so bad it's good. It's the story and the characters that shine though. the jokes are spot on, the running gags are spot on, and the lessons  he teaches his students are just amazing! I love the idea of student and teacher relationships (I mean the idea of being trapped in a room with a stranger that you don't know on the first day and gradually either love or hate them yet either way you're forced          
                              If I had a teacher like Onizuka I would actually have enjoyed school and looked forward to attending every day. The show itself is good but he makes it great. For those of you who have yet to watch it, please let me try and convince you with a short review to give it a try. This is my review.
                              Great Teacher Onizuka is a pretty cool dude. Sure he might be a bit of an idiot and has an unnatural perversion towards high school girls, but there is one thing he excels at and that’s knowing how to help his students. The lengths at which he goes to save some of them with disregard of his own safety is something rarely seen.
                              Let me start off by saying I'm a huge fan of GTO's manga, the source of all its zany, raunchy material. It's easily my favorite manga of all time, and because it is such, I have high expectations for the anime. Perhaps my expectations were unreasonably high, but regardless, I wasn't nearly as happy with the anime as I was with the manga.

                              Great Teacher Onizuka is a very popular title. Let us see why. The series focuses on the life of Onizuka Eikichi, who is an ex-bike gang leader. The man has only one goal now-- to become the greatest teacher in Japan. While doing his teaching internship as part of his studies to become a qualified teacher, he ends up not in an all-girls class as he has been dreaming for awhile, but in a delinquent class. There Onizuka learns the importance of the power and respect gained from one's students. Thanks to pure luck, or Onizuka’s shining charisma, after internship he gets a job at          
                              Great Teacher Onizuka is a heart-warming show, it's one of my personal favorites, but I will sincerely try not to be a biased reviewer.  That being said, Great Teacher Onizuka is a hilarious, laughable roller-coaster ride centering around a perverse ex-motor-bike gang-leader gone teacher who teaches life-lessons to his students.  
                              This is my first review. 
                              For the past few decades, schools have been plagued with higher student dropout rates, increased juvenile delinquency, and child disobedience. Increasing numbers of students care less for their future and education, resorting to violence, gangs, drugs, and sex. Things that degrade society. ",42
43,"""Mushi"": the most basic forms of life in the world. They exist without any goals or purposes aside from simply ""being."" They are beyond the shackles of the words ""good"" and ""evil."" Mushi can exist in countless forms and are capable of mimicking things from the natural world such as plants, diseases, and even phenomena like rainbows.

This is, however, just a vague definition of these entities that inhabit the vibrant world of Mushishi, as to even call them a form of life would be an oversimplification. Detailed information on Mushi is scarce because the majority of humans are unaware of their existence.

So what are Mushi and why do they exist? This is the question that a ""Mushishi,"" Ginko, ponders constantly. Mushishi are those who research Mushi in hopes of understanding their place in the world's hierarchy of life.

Ginko chases rumors of occurrences that could be tied to Mushi, all for the sake of finding an answer.

It could, after all, lead to the meaning of life itself.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.69,8,45,169,622616,23098,"                              In spirit, at least, each episode of Mushishi strongly reminds me of one thing: A cave painting. A depiction of man and the outside world, brief and primal but perfectly expressive, radiating mysticism, possessed of more meaning than it first appears to have.
                              Some people will tell you Mushishi is great because it doesn’t contain action and fanservice. These must be the same people who praise a film for not including Adam Sandler. They also make Mushishi look more pretentious than it is. It’s far from it. The problem is, even though Mushishi has a worthwhile aim and the right methods, it doesn’t know how to use them.
                              It's pretty rare to see a purely episodic anime that isn't a comedy, and that's just another reason Mushishi was such a treat.
                              Worshipping triviality and being unimaginative to a certain degree, are things that a solid narrative should always strive to avoid in order to culminate fans everywhere. When a fantasy narrative fails in painting an addictive universe for the viewer to grab onto, then it has certainly failed it’s job when it comes to being a well thought out story. However, even though the case is true with most Anime and other works, some prosaic Anime manage to escape the route of obscurity by chance, and end up receiving a ton of praise and gratitude from fans everywhere, simply because of certain factors that went into          
                              This anime was a very  unique experience. The show introduces a very interesting concept called the mushi. It'd be very difficult to describe what the mushi are precisely. In a nutshell , they're essentially spiritual beings, but at the same time they inhabit the physical world ( Yeah I know what your thinking, you just completely contradicted yourself. I know, I know just go with it) and they use humans as a host ( very similar to a parasite). One aspect in particular that struck me about the show was how it was devoid of any western influences whatsoever. Many anime fans don't realize          
                              This review contains no major spoilers. I was beyond thrilled when I had finally got my hands on Mushishi in its entirety. I have to shamelessly admit that I'm pretty dang easily entertained. So typically when there is a show that EVERYONE seems to love, I tend to enjoy it just as much. Unfortunately, once I got around to getting into the series I found a number of issues that others just didn't seem to have. I was entertained on a number of episodes, and definitely compelled to complete it. However, this certainly wasn't the masterpiece I thought I was about to watch.
                              So what reason could there be to praise a show that's been reviewed four times already, receiving highest marks? The answer is simple enough: it's been a long time since an anime has impressed me as much as Mushishi did. Going beyond the boundaries of the entertainment-based pop culture, this deserves the term 'art' in every aspect.
                               A compelling, mysterious and thought-provoking anime on being's known as Mushi. This unique show proves that an anime doesn't need to have romance, action, comedy or something thrilling to be interesting to watch.
                              Mushishi is, to tell the truth, nothing very special. It doesn't try to stand out, nor does it feed us with anime standards, like moe, or fanservice. it doesn't have flashy action - hardly any at all in fact - nor has it excessive amounts of blood. In fact this in itself is what makes it stand up. Its tranquility and taking things at a calm pace is what makes Mushishi so great, yet in a way it is also what makes it a bit offputting to some.
                              Many struggle with wrapping their heads around specific folklore that is entirely different from the cultural roots of their own country. It can be an arduous task for the ill-prepared minds that nevertheless want to explore all facets of any country’s folklore that captures the entirety of how it’s culture evolved from its roots to the present. There haven’t been many shows, or anime for that manner, that have handled folklore with the level of atmosphere and creativity that the show Mushishi has to offer and for this, we have to be thankful for its existence. A beautiful existence to be more specific.
                              I heard about this anime a while ago, but the synopsis didn't seem that appealing to me.  So I basically forgot about it until recently and decided to watch a few episodes to see why it was so well regarded...

                              Overview:
                              It’s very nice that Mushishi had showed a great way of enjoying such scenery, environment, and culture of each passing scene as you might find yourself exploring its wonders and deeper meaning of it, which the series proves when you’re into this world. Starting with its bunch of supernatural and mystery that engulfs the whole series, it never crossed to my mind that it is dull, boring, typical, and all used up theme just like the others, thus, it has shown such different mixture of drama, tension, and unusual phenomenon that will surely be a factor why this show is worthy to be watched",43

On his travels he comes across the likes of Wolf Kanagushi and Goromaki Gondo, men who unintentionally fan the dying embers inside him, leading him to putting his wanderings to an end.

In attempt to quell those issues, Carlos Rivera, a world renowned boxer is invited from Venezuela to help Joe recover.",8.67,8,48,2961,30574,1574,"                              The story of the heroic story of a wonderful atmosphere of a very mixed boxing and drama, at one time , Joe is also a personal hero will not be repeated in the world of Animes ever ! 
                              Joe Yabuki is a young man from the slums who recently came out of juvy where he met his rival Toru Rikkishi. Sadly, this season spoils the conclusion of said rivalry as the events are featured in its 1970's 1st season which should be watch first. This sequel continues where the original anime left off giving a slight recap of events as it moves forward with the themes of the story. The many challenges Joe faces are the consequences for boxing & the permanent damage he delivers to his opponents along with Joe's own torment. Joe's life is full of grief, hope, & commitment to          
                              Warning there are spoilers in the series, so I recommend that you finish the second season before reading this review. 
                              The original Ashita no Joe is often regarded as the anime medium's first true masterpiece - in spite of some key flaws that prevent it from truly being one. As such, it is exceptional more for its time than anything else. The same cannot be said, however, of Ashita no Joe 2, which is an improvement in almost every regard.
                              Ashita no Joe 2 started out a little bit lacking, but quickly became so addictive that I made time to watch all 47 episodes within 1 week. I found it to be slightly less appealing than the original Ashita no Joe series, though it's still amazing. 
                              I know that people think  i'm Exaggerating by giving this old work 10 as an overall,but to be honest,i've seen so many anime in my life and non of those ever reach to the depth of my heart like Ashita no Joe did!

                              story: 10/10
                              WOW.... I can't believe this show is over from the very first season and episode I was trapped . first it starts off kinda of slow and boring but it's usually the ones that start out that way that equal an amazing anime Anyway excuse my grammar but this show is fudging exceptional you learn the story of a young man and his conquest to achieve his happiness and bring about change in his local area as well as in himself . This season (being the last) shows just how far he's came and evolved into a mature and grateful young man . I urge          
                              The real Rocky if you ask me, in fact the manga is older than the Rocky films. By far the best sports anime of all time that tells the story of Joe, a troubled teen that has been dealt a bad hand by fate for most of his life but as a result of being homeless with no family or friends to go to he's learned to survive and fight as well. For most of his life he has drifted as a juvenile trouble making vagabond, but one day an old washed out boxer that has nothing in life but booze comes across Joe fighting

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.67,8,49,734,202941,1604,"                              To start things off, I can say is that it’s about damn time that a new anime installment of Hajime no Ippo came under way. Even though the first anime series was 70 plus episodes, I felt I didn’t get enough by the time I finished watching it. To me, Ippo vs Sendo 2 was actually the beginning!!! Since then, I decided to read the manga and currently up to date on it which is now nearly 90 volumes, and I’ll say I still haven’t gotten enough!!! But moving on, to a certain extent, New Challenger for what it covers is faithful to the manga          
                              Overview:
                              Intro: 
                              Story: 9/10
                              It's heartbreaking to see one of your favorite anime series end, so you can guess why I was so happy to hear that there was a sequel to Hajime no Ippo. I wasn't disappointed. New Challenger lived up, and passed, everything it should be. From the side splitting comedy, to the heartwarming matches; you'll never be let down. What New Challenger lacks in length, it makes up in perfection. You'll laugh, you'll cry, and then you'll laugh until you cry. You won't be able to pull away until the end. Yes, I was sad when I realized that New Challenger was only 26 episodes, but          
                              Hajime no Ippo: New Challenger, ah this brings me back. Even though most people are probably reading this review after watching the first season, I still must address this note anyways. Yes this is about boxing, but it is about so much more than that. A love of boxing, or any sport for that matter, is not needed to enjoy this show. The Ippo anime will give you an entirely new view of boxing as a whole. I'm writing this review to try and convince at least someone to look past their anti-sport anime list to watch this. 
                              When I wrote a review on the first season I was very glad to be able to write so many good things about it . All the expectations I had heading into the show were met . The 2nd season however didn't live up to my expectations at all .The show took away most of the things I loved about the first animated season . Let's take a look at the story first .While the first season had an amazing structure with builds and progress , this had little of that . I will deal with the progress issue in characters section but however lets          
                              After a few years in the wilderness, I had suspicions of the anime losing steam or having different voice actors taking roles from the originals. However this was not the case!
                              Story: 7/10
                              Hajime no Ippo: New Challenger Review
                              For me Hajime no Ippo: New Challenger picks up pretty well from where it left off. I myself didn't feel like there was any hitches. It still had a lot of the important things the first series had for me.
                              Okay if you are reading this it must mean you are watching or interested in watching this masterpiece. Hajime no ippo is truly the BEST SPORT ANIME EVER and i can say that for certain.The first season of hajime no ippo came out in 2000 and its still rank top 5 overall so the new season will be just as good or even better with almost every member of the previous season will be working in this anime so it will truly be something else. I can pretty much say for certain that this anime will blow every other anime away cuz you can't be

That castle is home to the magnificent wizard Howl, infamous for both his magical prowess and for being a womanizer—or so the rumor goes in Sophie Hatter's small town. Sophie, as the plain daughter of a hatmaker, does not expect much from her future and is content with working hard in the shop. 

However, Sophie's simple life takes a turn for the exciting when she is ensnared in a disturbing situation, and the mysterious wizard appears to rescue her. Unfortunately, this encounter, brief as it may be, spurs the vain and vengeful Witch of the Waste—in a fit of jealousy caused by a past discord with Howl—to put a curse on the maiden, turning her into an old woman.

In an endeavor to return to normal, Sophie must accompany Howl and a myriad of eccentric companions—ranging from a powerful fire demon to a hopping scarecrow—in his living castle, on a dangerous adventure as a raging war tears their kingdom apart.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.67,8,50,99,857933,18157,"                              I'd figured that waiting so long to see this made me a bad Miyazaki fan, but after seeing it, I wasn't much bothered by my long delay anymore.
                              TITLE: How's Moving Castle
                              Based on the book by Diana Wynne Jones, I approached Howl's Moving Castle after seeing Spirited Away (another Miyazaki film). Watching the opening scene we are introduced to a massive walking metal shack, the ""moving castle"" of the title. I honestly didn't know what to make of the film initially, but just that scene demonstrated to me the film's animation was going to be as good as, if not better than Spirited Away.
                              I love the Studio Ghibli films. So far I think it is safe to say that Miyazaki is my favourite anime author, and I doubt anyone will ever take his place because I have grown so attached to the work of this man and his ideals reflected on the way he conceives animation, that I can't think of a deeper connection with one's style in any way.
                              It’s never a good sign when I finish a film and the first thought that pops into my head is, “What the hell was that?” Unfortunately, that’s the situation I found myself in upon completing Howl’s Moving Castle, a film which started out promising enough before proceeding to baffle and confuse me at pretty much every turn. I’m almost convinced there was some critical plot element or thematic undercurrent that I somehow missed, to the point where I wonder if I should really be writing this review without first having a second watch to make sure that my aggravated confusion is genuinely on the film’s          
                              Howl's Moving Castle has to be the most overrated of all Miyazaki's films. While it produces legendary animation and a wonderful soundtrack, the story is dull with characters that are difficult to get attached to at all. There is very little character development and many of the characters seem absolutely useless to the plot. The relationships between the characters are also sloppily done with a rushed feeling to them, making them feel like nothing special. Also, not enough is learned about ANY of the characters' pasts and many of their actions seem inconsistent with the personalities you previously thought you knew, making it unpredictable in          
                              Howl's Moving Castle is, ultimately, just one example in the ever-growing pile of evidence as to why the word &quot;miss&quot; is never associated with Myazaki.
                              Howl's Moving Castle is a movie which is greatly acclaimed and loved. I wanted to see what I was missing out on so I watched it. 
                              Overview:
                              First off this is another great film from Hayao Miyazaki I personally loved this film the characters are bright, and vibrant with great personalities which is one of the things that makes me whatch this film over and over again.The film is also good because it can be watched by an entire family and be enjoyed on many diffrent levels,the enviroment in the film are beautifuly rendered and the range from beautiful fantasy, to early modern war periods I would reccomend this anime for anyone first off who is a Hayao Miyazaki but most importantly who is intrested in seeing a masterpiece of its own          
                              Howl's moving castle, the creator seems to enjoy making his movie have many slice of life elements such as a family atmosphere. While that is nice when it gets too prolonged, it starts to become unnecessary filler and ruins pacing, which I believe you need a good in a film. There was no exciting moments, especially with a film like this we could see more glimpses of the world, rather than focusing too much on the characters.
                              Hayao Miyazaki is rightfully considered one of the great artists working in the anime form. Eschewing the hard-edged violence that many American viewers (rightly or wrongly) associate with the form, Miyazaki creates painterly, pastoral visions filled with beauty and eccentric charm. And unlike much of anime, his characters are really animated: they live and breathe and move; they don’t just stand there filling up the composition while the extreme camera angles, moody lighting and striking character design strive to compensate for minimal movement. Moreover, the writer-director is not just a painter of pretty pictures; he fills his films with deeply felt themes (environment, war, etc)          
                              I got the book this move was based off of randomly at the library one day, and really enjoyed it. When I heard this move existed I was quite happy, that is until I actually watched it. It seemed to me that a lot of the plot was cut out, and that the characters just weren't the characters I had come to love. 
                              Previously, I've reviewed another Ghibli movie where I did explain that although it was a 5/10 and that it was mostly gonna overview the fact that I didn't like it because I was the wrong audience and give some information for some likeminded individuals. It is absolutely not the same situation here because there's plenty of things wrong and to criticize.
                              I really can't say I enjoyed this film. For me, story points and character play a large role in my investment into a film, with the art and sound playing supporting roles. ",48

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.66,8,51,45,1223917,68285,"                              Perhaps no other show I have viewed have I gone into with higher expectations and hype than with Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann.  Practically everyone I know has told me about how awesome it is, how its epic ending is the best thing since the invention of the internal combustion engine.  Looking back I suppose that made it inevitable for me to be let down and disappointed.
                              The show that turns boys into men.
                              Only on the rarest of occasions does an anime come along that truly grabs me and elevates itself above mere entertainment and into the realms of gripping television. Gurren Lagann did this with frightening ease, not with complexity or depth of its storyline, nor with its technical excellence, or innovation, but with its boldness, energy, sense of humour, and heart. Some people may be put off with the degree of silliness the show never ceases to deliver, or at least be deterred from becoming deeply invested in the plot or its characters, but being the sucker for just this kind of shameless splendour and over-the-top          
                              Gainax is easily one of the most well known anime studio, especially with titles like, Neon Genesis Evangelion, KareKano, and Wings of Honneamise.  However, as of late many fans claim that the quality of Gainax has dropped down significantly and that their golden age is over, well that was until Gurren Lagann.  Without a doubt Gurren Lagann took both Japanese and western fandom by storm.  This coupled with the fact that there was very little hype before hand thus, making the extreme popularity even more impressive.  For me what was more impressive was the fact that people that normally don&rsquo;t like          
                              ""The story of a man who fights to forge his own destiny.""
                              I just finished watching TTGL about a few days ago, and let me tell you all, this anime isn't rated #1 for nothing.
                              Your review is the review that will pierce the public opinion!
                              I was basically forced into watching TTGL by my brother, and I'm ever so grateful because I, like many others, had not experienced true epicness until I saw this series.
                              &quot;Who the hell do you think I am?!&quot;
                              	First of all, I'd like to point out that I do not normally watch anime about mecha. That being said, I found Gurren Lagann to be a fresh look at the genre, and one that was quite entertaining as well. Unfortunately, I do think the show has been slightly overrated (being ranked #1 on this site at the time of writing) and for this reason my expectations upon starting Gurren Lagann were somewhat higher than they should have been. I'd have probably enjoyed the show more if I'd gone in with my usual attitude toward anime of this genre and been pleasantly surprised rather than          
                              Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is a fast paced, no-holds-barred Shounen, Sci-fi, Mecha, Adventure anime that takes many of the elements that worked well, to form something that is bursting with entertainment. ^_^
                              When I hear about a company making a mecha anime, there are only two things that spring to mind: either they are brilliant, or they are goddamn blind and living under a rock. Thankfully for fans of anime worldwide, the boys and gals at Gainax are neither blind, nor living under a rock. The simple fact is that Gainax has proven one universal truth: no matter how saturated the genre may appear at any given time, there is always room for improvement. All you need is a robot with two heads, arguably the most elusive quality in a mecha.
                              Every once in a while a series comes along that, for lack of a better word, owns the competition. Ladies and gentlemen that series is Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, do not let the lengthy name intimidate you or the seemingly cartoonish style put you off  because this show is worth it and you'd sorely regret not experiencing this gem of a series. In a world where the majority considers mediocre shows such as Naruto to be masterpieces, we often overlook shows that so sorely deserve our attention and they end up just passing us by. I'm writing this review in hopes it will divert          
                              When reading some of the reviews for Gurren Lagann, I realized very quickly that a lot of people are transposing their enjoyment of the series onto their opinion of its story and characterization quality.

50,"Takashi Natsume has grown accustomed to his encounters with youkai through the Book of Friends, which contains the names of youkai whom his grandmother, Reiko Natsume, has sealed in contracts. These encounters allow Natsume to better understand the youkai, Reiko, and himself. 

The Book of Friends is a powerful tool that can be used to control youkai; it is sought after by both youkai and exorcists alike. Natsume just wants to live out his daily life in peace but is constantly disrupted by these experiences. If he is to end this torment, Natsume must explore more about the book and the world of exorcism, as well as begin to open his heart to those who can help him.

                              The 6th Season of Natsume's book of friends, First of all I'm proud of how far this series has come and just how consistent it is with it's quality. It's an anime that has never disappointed me, And I hope it gets a lot more seasons.
                              My first impressions for this show after watching the first two episodes, I felt that the season would focus on motifs of Natsume growing up with unique capabilities and what life was like for him during these difficult times. It turns out that I wasn’t too far off on my hypothesis! Woot.Very much like the previous season, this new addition has been quite reflective in regards to Natsume’s past, mostly in relation to the obstacles that he faced as a child. We get to experience more concrete glimpses into the core facets via contemplative thoughts that our protagonist has about the person he used to          
                              If you've made it as far as the sixth season you're probably well aware of the charm and appeal of Natsume. What I'm here to call everyone's attention to however is this season has PEAK Nyanko-sensei animation. You will be treated to love, bounciness, cuteness, care and attention put into each frame of art that is the upmost joy to watch out of this calico cat. The likes of which you didn't realized would be topped from before. Okay, thank you for coming to my TED talk
                              So, I've made it to the sixth season of Natsume's Book of Friends. Each season, I feel like this story gets better and better and closer and closer to what I want to see from it. 
                              I wanted my first review to be about Natsume's book of friends because..MY GOD IT'S SOOO BEAUTIFUL.
                              So far among all the anime series I have watched, this one is the best. I loved all the 11 episodes of this season, especially the first 3. 
                              *Spoiler Free Review*
                              Natsume yuujinchou is one of the few shows which calms the soul. Throughout watching it, since season 1, it made me feel extremely calm and happy about the world around me. That in itself is one of it's biggest successes. Amongst all the gore, action and fast paced anime, natsume yuujinchou gives us the opportunity to look around at the world around us and appreciate beauty. It has beautiful messages in each episode about kindness and empathy, which teaches one alot.
                              Natsume Yuujinchou Roku: Another smashing success for the Natsume Yuujinchou series! Finally, Natsume has some friends...
                              It's a consistently well-done anime, each season has different things for Natsume to learn, from dealing with being honest with others, choosing to help Youkai, to even moving on from his past traumas, he moves forward and enjoys life. 
                              I'm here one more time to make a review of the best anime. Well, Natsume Yuujinchou is the most heartwarming anime I've ever watched. I've just finished watching the anime and I can really say it now: Natsume Yuujinchou NEVER disappoints me. 
                              To be honest, in just 4 days, I finished watching all the 5 seasons of this anime, oh boy no regrets. Probably the only anime I binge-watched all of its seasons religiously, even though I'm a pretty busy person because of work, I HAVE to find time to binge-watch this show because it's just amazing and heartwarming. 
                              The story line of Natsume Yuujinchou is impeccable and it left me with an incredibly warm feeling after watching every single episode. The opening and ending songs really tie in well together with the plot, and it is one of the few animes where i do not skip through the ops and eds. I followed this series for a long time already, but there is still the unwavering anticipation for the next episode/ season to come out.
                              If you are here reading the review for the sixth season then you must have already watched the previous seasons, I presume. ",50
51,"One cold Christmas day, Kyon heads over to school and the SOS Brigade's holiday celebration, only to realize that Haruhi Suzumiya seems to have disappeared. Moreover, no one even remembers her or the SOS Brigade; Mikuru Asahina knows nothing and is now afraid of him, and Itsuki Koizumi has also gone missing. The Literature Club, formed only by an uncharacteristically shy Yuki Nagato, now occupies the old SOS club room.

Suzumiya Haruhi no Shoushitsu is based on the fourth light novel of the acclaimed Haruhi series and is set after the events of the anime series. Not uncultured in the supernatural, Kyon will have to deal with his whole life turned upside down like a bad joke, and maybe it's better that way.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.65,8,53,245,489182,11622,"                              Assuming that a standard episode is about 20 minutes long, many would ask, “Couldn’t they just have taken out some “Endless Eight” episodes and add this movie into the 2009 Haruhi season?” However, with The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya being 2 hours and 40 minutes, it would not be possible to fit it into a 14 episode season without condensing the majority of the plot and the monologues of Kyon.
                              I’ve always had mixed feelings about the show where the esper, the alien, the time traveler, and the normal highschool student all gathered together to entertain that certain ecstatic girl. However, as time passed by, it ended up being one of my favourite guilty pleasures. How could I forget the super fun misadventures of the SOS Brigade? Kyon’s snarky attitude? Haruhi’s one of a kind personality? And, most of all, Mikuru’s tea?
                              First off i would like to start this review by saying that I found this movie very enjoyable. It was good just like the original series but possessed a different tone and threw in different elements that helped me see what was going on in the world a little deeper.
                              In a time when originality is something rare to find in animes, it is the way the content is delivered that defines whether a show becomes great or not, and in this aspect the Haruhi Suzumiya series is when it shines the most. Everyone that knows the series knows that this franchise has always been the ""odd guy"" that stands out when it comes to the way things are presented or given to the fans, with jumbled chronological airing, or slipping new episodes into what would be otherwise a ""re-run"" of the old series, or repeating the same events for 8 different episodes. While the

                              Hmmm writing a review for the Haruhi Movie is a bit tough, as its not something you'd want to screw up, so lets take a quick look back as to why that is. Haruhi started off as an original an innovative series that captured the heart of many portraying the life of a girl with God like powers as seen through the eyes of a sarcastic yet very relatable boy. The series was a huge success and even to this day you can walk into any internet forum, type something about aliens, espers, and time travelers, and at least somebody will understand what your talking          
                              Perhaps the best 2 hours of my life today re-watching this film. I absolutely enjoyed watching Suzumiya Haruhi no Shoushitsu again! It was  a major upgrade in terms of story and character relationships from the anime. Few things I loved about the movie was the outstanding story and relationships between the SOS brigade. When you watch the anime (not the movie) it can be quite the chore actually trying to get through it. However the movie adds to the story that interesting ""But what if"" factor and it just completely re-write everything into..dare I say ""Greatness!""
                              So after the debacle which was the endless eight I came into The Disappearance of Hrauhi Suzumiya with just as much scepticism as when I first entered the franchise. This time, however, I was overwhelmed with surprises.
                              *Spoilers for Suzumiya Haruhi no Shoushitsu*
                              **SPOILER FREE REVIEW**
                              Let me be blunt: The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya was, unquestionably, mediocre, nearly pointless drivel. I will never understand how the anime garnered the popularity it did with those two seasons.
                              I was never a really big fan of Haruhi to begin with. I watched the first season because of recommendations and word of mouth. The premise itself was interesting to say the least, perhaps a little dumb. High school girl has deity-esque powers and controls the world around her with her emotions without actually knowing that? Not to mention that it was again up to a bunch of high school kids to save the world from her mood swings...yeah it sounds pretty dumb on paper. What made it work so well for me was the main character nobody ever thought would make a good main          
                              The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya was never a series I liked a lot. I watch the latest anime craze go by and I never watch the 'trendy' anime until months even years after it's completion. Due to this, I believe I lose the extra 'oomph' that makes everyone love the new 'trendy' anime so much.
                              I'll be blunt right up front and to the point. Suzumiya Haruhi no Shoushitsu is a fine movie, great even depending on how you view it but it has a few overwhelming flaws that keep it from being all that I could be. But before I get too far into that I will put this up since, this review is not going to garner much sympathy. I liked the original series and that in no way holds sway over the opinion I'm about to state. So no more stalling on to the review.
                              Until I saw this movie, I was rather unimpressed with the Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya anime.  I had seen the first season and really liked it, but the second season severely disillusioned me.  I got it into my head that the things that drew me into the original 14 episodes were the art, the humor, the variety, and the novelty.  With Season 2, it seemed that once you took those away and focused on the plot, the anime was mediocre at best.",51
53,"Hana, a hard-working college student, falls in love with a mysterious man who attends one of her classes though he is not an actual student. As it turns out, he is not truly human either. On a full moon night, he transforms, revealing that he is the last werewolf alive. Despite this, Hana's love remains strong, and the two ultimately decide to start a family.

Hana gives birth to two healthy children—Ame, born during rainfall, and Yuki, born during snowfall—both possessing the ability to turn into wolves, a trait inherited from their father. All too soon, however, the sudden death of her lover devastates Hana's life, leaving her to raise a peculiar family completely on her own. The stress of raising her wild-natured children in a densely populated city, all while keeping their identity a secret, culminates in a decision to move to the countryside, where she hopes Ame and Yuki can live a life free from the judgments of society. Wolf Children is the heartwarming story about the challenges of being a single mother in an unforgiving modern world.

What the film's title promises is accurate, but this is secondary to what the film is actually about. This is a movie entirely about the enduring and triumphant nature of maternal love. 
                              I saw this film yesterday and, having enjoyed it immensely, was pleased to read that it has won the award for Best Animated Feature Film at the 45th annual Sitges International Fantastic Film Festival (a Spanish film festival). This perhaps comes as little surprise given that it is the work of Mamoru Hosoda, acclaimed director of ""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"" and ""Summer Wars"" (both of which also won the same award at previous Sitges festivals). I dare say that Mamoru has exceeded himself with this film, taking observations and musings from his own life - the film supposedly being based on thoughts he

                              The story starts with a rather plain looking college girl and her romantic adventures with this dashingly attractive young man. It turns out that he’s a wolf-man, but the lady doesn’t care because golly, he really is quite a catch. Besides, wolves are cool, so it could be worse. He could be an uncool animal like a sea-cucumber man. They have kids together but raising them in the big city is a bit of a pain, especially since they keep turning into wolves when they get annoyed. So they move to the countryside and start a new life there. It is one half about the          
                              You know sometimes being the fans that we are of all sorts of media, you think to yourself, there's no way ""this"" could be better than ""that"", well this is one of those times you'd be wrong. I'll just start literally by saying ""Ookami Kodomo no Ame to Yuki"" is amazing 10/10 and must be watched by all. 
                              A girl meets a guy, falls in love, finds out that he's a werewolf, but doesn't mind (loving him and having his kids). Sounds familiar? Thankfully, the focus of this story is not the relationship between the couple, but between the mother and her children. Although this makes for an interesting approach to the overused concept of the relationship between humans and their wolf relatives, it falls short in producing a convincing account of their fight to overcome the odds that such a family would be up against.
                              Just a fair heads up to whoever may be reading this, this IS my very first review so bear with me.
                              Wolf Children is a good choice for you if you'd enjoy a mellow movie about a widow raising her two kids. However note that it isn't a particularly exciting or eventful movie, and it mostly focuses on how the mother attempts to raise her children and how these children develop and mature. So it becomes a bad choice if you expect anything beyond the simple lives of these people, even with the supernatural element of werewolf children, it doesn't have narrative hooks and the incentive it tries to give you from the very beginning isn't a particularly strong one to continue watching the movie, since          
                              This is my first review on this website, and I thought I'd create an account just to review this movie. Ookami Kodomo no Ame to Yuki, or Wolf Children has been recommended to me endlessly, as it was regarded (by them) to be Miyazaki material, if not better. 
                              Ookami Kodomo no Ame to Yuki, or Wolf Children, as it is called in English, is a two hour animated film directed by Hosoda Mamoru of Studio Chizu. Hosoda formerly worked at Toei Animation and Madhouse before establishing his own studio.

                              Wolf children, a story about a single mother Hana who is tasked with the mission of raising her children Ame and Yuki on her own after her boyfriend had died. But these are not ordinary children as there farther was part wolf and so are the kids. 
                              ""I'm your average college student, life is normal but everything changed when I met him. I fell in love and had kids."" 
                              Review in brief: While Wolf Children is soothing and has some interesting ideas, putting more than a little thought into what's happening on-screen can easily throw your mind out of the aesthetic cradle the movie builds as you realize just how silly and simple the whole thing is. Considering the clear effort to make this movie a poignant fantasy about a struggling family, it can safely be said that it’s not trying to be either of those things.

                              So far this continuation of Re:Zero keeps delivering, just business as usual. No OP or ED so far either, with almost 30 min long episodes. More content and love to the people!
                              So after a very great part one of season two. How is part 2 of this season fairing compared to the previous part and Re:Zero as a whole? Let me tell you!
                              Everybody loves Re:Zero. At the time of writing this, the first season sits at #21 on MAL’s popularity chart. The first half of the second season is ranked within the top 100 anime of all time by user ratings. And season 2 part 2 is currently sitting at #40 in those same ratings. So I guess it’s up to me to be the lone dissenting voice in the crowd: while I liked the original show, I do not like this sequel.
                              Re:zero will be a zero no matter how it resume.
                              Nobody I know understands the story now. The sanctuary arc has taken so long and has so much exposition that there is no room for enjoyment.
                              The Re:Zero anime inspires an incredible amount of zealousness in its fans, but otherwise lacks remarkable qualities. It has its entertaining moments, decent shots for art, and a reasonably solid sound track. The plot is convoluted and can drag quite a bit, but if you manage to follow it, has substance. The characters, however, are a weak point for me. The show's protagonist seems to have an inescapable gravitational pull which ultimately pulls every character and plot point in until he is the focus of everyone's world. I imagine this isn't a problem for those who are big fans of Subaru or are self-inserting as          
                              -CAUTION: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS-
                              I never understood why Re Zero is considered as a great show. Re Zero started off strong with S1 and used the MC's powers as a proper way to tell the story, but going forward it was just used a tool for lazy story writing. S2 Part 1 was a dragged out mess and S2 Part 1 is basically flashbacks the show. People complain about how anime often uses simply flashbacks as a mean of making people care about the characters, so the master writing of Re Zero decided to call it 'trials' and decided it was the best thing ever. Apparently Re Zero's MC          
                              The best parts of season 2 have been the character backstories and in part 2 we get to learn about the more mysterious characters (including Otto) which sets up the plot to become more interesting as it goes along. Subaru's relationship (situationship?) with Emilia also progresses (kinda) and stops being an awkward hot mess (finally).
                              Oh boy, the story on how to turn a okay-ish anime with potential into complete garbage with later seasons.
                              The second part of the second seasons seems to be the conclusion of all the mysteries which unfolded upon us in the first part.

57,"""The hero comes. The hero comes. The hero comes. Chant these words in your mind, and I'll surely come to you..."" This mantra is what Makoto Tsukimoto repeats as a source of motivation when he fights through the stress of not only grueling ping pong matches, but also in situations of his life. Makoto doesn't fight alone; he and his friend, Yutaka Hoshino, nicknamed Smile and Peco respectively, are two boys who have grown up playing ping pong together nearly every day. Peco, brimming with confidence, aims to be the best table tennis player in the world; Smile, on the other hand, shows little ambition. Nevertheless, the two have always stuck together, with a bond built upon their mutual love for this sport.

Every year, students from all across Japan gather for the inter-high table tennis competition to achieve national and international stardom. Through intense training and competition, only the very best persevere.

From the avant-garde director of Tatami Galaxy, Masaaki Yuasa, Ping Pong the Animation serves a tale of ambition with its fair share of bumps along the way. Whatever the odds, Peco and Smile will face them together.

Much of the anime industry has taken to fan-service oriented pandering and it's left me craving for something new. Something that can blow me away with it's creativity and unorthodox presentation. Utilizing its unconventional style, fantastic character development, symbolism, and occasional moments of witty dry humor, Ping Pong The Animation is that something.
                              ""Chant these words three times in your mind!"" 
                              I recently reviewed something and gave it praise for the narrative it was able to achieve in 13 episodes. I can’t help but share that sentiment in regards to what Ping Pong is able to accomplish with its 11 episodes. A transformation story from angsty adolescence to enlightened and matured adults, Ping Pong goes well and truly beyond the generic confines of the sports genre illustrating a beautiful narrative of complex emotional growth and maturation, truly cementing its place as a modern classic. 
                              Oh yeah, Ping Pong: The Animation.
                              Ping Pong The Animation is my one hundredth completed Anime up until this point in my Anime watching hobby/career, and I would feel bad about myself if I did not review this amazing Anime, and let this opportunity all go to waste. So why did I choose Ping Pong The Animation, in particular, to be my one hundredth Anime to be completed? Why not choose any other Anime out of the thousands of Anime on the site? Why Ping Pong in particular? Well, there are many good reasons for that. First of all, I wanted my one hundredth Anime to be something of great quality,          
                              ""He's got to have a hole in his defense! He's reading me—he's predicting my moves. Show me your weak point! I just can't afford to end here!"" Think these lines are from the latest battle shounen? Wrong: they're from none other than Ping Pong: The Animation! If the theme of table tennis doesn't pique your interest, looking at the show's creators certainly should. Masaaki Yuasa, known for making great creative anime, teams up with Taiyou Matsumoto, a mangaka with similar experimental tendencies: the harmless fun-filled game of table tennis suddenly got a whole lot more interesting.
                              Ping Pong won the all exciting adventure this spring season of anime was and became anime of the season. Spring 2014 winner, woohoo.

                              THIS IS THE GREATEST...................................DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!!
                              An anime about sports? An anime about ping pong? I would have never thought to ever give a show like this a try, while I do like the occasional play of table tennis in my freetime and during sports at school the idea of watching others playing it in the animated form was somewhat dull but interesting. Having heard from other sources that it is actually quite good and among the best series of this season I decided to check Ping Pong: The Animation out.
                              Ping Pong The Animation, originally created by Matsumoto Taiyou, is more than what one would call unique, even more so if you just look at sports Anime.
                              To dismiss, or to even think of Ping Pong: The Animation as another sports anime would be a gross error of judgement. Ping Pong: The Animation is not about sports. It is not about Ping Pong. Not really. It is a profoundly human story; a look at the lives, passions, and motivations of characters that sound and act so real that you can’t help think of them as real flesh and blood, people with feelings, emotions and souls of their own.
                              Ping Pong: The Animation is one of the most astonishing anime I’ve ever seen. It’s something that could only come out of passion and devotion from an eccentric auteur who prides himself in the unique and extraordinary. Only masters and madmen could produce works as tight and uniquely crafted as this. It’s easy to see why this show is regarded as a masterpiece. Frankly, this anime deserves all the praise it gets.
                              The anime industry is plagued with generic harems and bad writing. But occasionally a series will appear that stands out. A diamond in the rough. Ping Pong is one of these series.

58,"A shinigami, as a god of death, can kill any person—provided they see their victim's face and write their victim's name in a notebook called a Death Note. One day, Ryuk, bored by the shinigami lifestyle and interested in seeing how a human would use a Death Note, drops one into the human realm.

High school student and prodigy Light Yagami stumbles upon the Death Note and—since he deplores the state of the world—tests the deadly notebook by writing a criminal's name in it. When the criminal dies immediately following his experiment with the Death Note, Light is greatly surprised and quickly recognizes how devastating the power that has fallen into his hands could be.            

With this divine capability, Light decides to extinguish all criminals in order to build a new world where crime does not exist and people worship him as a god. Police, however, quickly discover that a serial killer is targeting criminals and, consequently, try to apprehend the culprit. To do this, the Japanese investigators count on the assistance of the best detective in the world: a young and eccentric man known only by the name of L.

In fact, there are lots of good reasons but they can be summed up in one thing: this anime is amazing. Want to know why? Then just keep on reading.
                              Allow me to explain my love of ""the pay off"" in entertainment:

                              Q: What happens when an unstoppable Mary Sue meets an immovable Mary Sue? 
                              This has to be one of the most ingenious shows ever!
                              There's something fundamentally contrived about Death Note which takes what would normally be its best quality, the story/plot, and makes it difficult for a viewer to enjoy it once they start questioning the plot points and devices.  For different people, these are things that can either be overlooked or overtake the show absolutely, and it really depends on both how critically one wants to watch Death Note and how far they're willing to suspend their disbelief.  The major problem Death Note faces is how seriously it takes the threat of a killer notebook being dropped into the world, and how realistic a stance          
                              Death Note will forever be the best suspense anime for me..... and millions of fans.
                              Adapted by Madhouse in 2006 from the popular Shonen Jump manga written by Ohba Tsugumi and drawn by Obata Takeshi, Death Note is an entertaining ride if an ultimately shallow work.  Unless you just got into the fandom, I’ll assume you are already familiar with the basic plot.
                              The #1 popular anime on this site, and perhaps in the world. But does Death Note deserve all that popularity and praise? People are entitled to their own opinions based off of how they perceived (if there were any) the themes in Death Note, and how much people individually enjoyed the anime. But this anime is definitely one that EVERYONE should watch and decide for themselves how much they like/dislike it. If you haven't seen Death Note yet, then I'd definitely recommend you to watch it, because in my own opinion, Death Note is the greatest anime made. Of course, I may have over-thought the          
                              Death Note is probably one of the best series I&rsquo;ve ever seen. What I really like about it is that I feel the need to pay attention &ndash; that rarely happens with the other series I&rsquo;ve watched. If you blink too much you might miss what&rsquo;s happening.
                              Death Note is original, awesome, and a great anime to watch. The only reason it isn't perfect is because of Near who has to be the lamest enemy ever. Also, the ending was a total cop-out. DUMB, DUMB, DUMB. 
                              This is one of the most engaging thriller anime i have ever seen EVER. How could that be? Let me count the ways...
                              I might be the only living anime fan that hasn&rsquo;t enjoyed Death Note.  The reason really is because it seemed to be gimmicky to me.  It doesn&rsquo;t mean this series is in any way bad, no not at all, it just isn&rsquo;t my cup of tea as they say.  After about half the series I began to feel less and less like finishing, counting the number of episodes I had left to watch.  To be honest it is a quality series with many and more good features, themes, characters and ideas, but it just didn&rsquo;t mesh with me.

Several years later in that same mountain, the mushishi Ginko encounters a strange girl with weeds growing out of her body. Soon after, Ginko coincidentally runs into the now grown-up boy Yoshiro on his way off the mountain. With Yoshiro’s help, Ginko soon begins to uncover who this mysterious girl is and what happened to her.

                              It's the end of an era, and this story couldn't have gone out any better than it did in this film. Mushishi is filled with wonderful stories, tragic truths, and beautiful scenery that's all topped off with a hell of a main character. This film is no different.

And once again, I happened to see another anime movie that same day for half the price (Miss Hokusai), and yet was structured way more like a movie than how Shaft has been handling this ""totally not worth the wait"" prequel, which still baffles me.

                              No spoilers.
                              In anime, there are plenty of cases where the sequel is better than the first season, but does the same hold true with anime movies? In the case of Kizumonogatari, YES!
                              Story:
                              Story-1
                              (7.0/10) 
                              Oh my, yes! I will attempt to make that my only embellishing statement, but no promises. 
                              This... was actually more garbage than the first movie. Wow. 
                              TL;DR: the problem with Kizumonogatari is that it was never a good story to adapt in the first place, and the studio's efforts to turn it into an interesting tale proved fruitless.
                              Part II documents the descent of Araragi into a vampire, since for a long time he is teetering on the edge between humanity. However, it took a rather tedious device involving Hanekawa to bring about this change. Indicative of the Monogatari series, the whole conflict and interest stems from the unlikelihood and contrivance of characteristics. Hanekawa sticks around despite the risk -- perhaps because of the risk. In one scene, she confesses being someone of self-satisfaction instead of self-sacrifice, although it's unclear whether she's being honest. Regardless, the situation could have only occurred due to how perverse both Araragi and Hanekawa actually are, such that          
                              Well what do you have to say about that movie? Holy fucking shit. That was just great, just fucking amazingly great. The cinematography was interesting and on point. The cinematic techniques of choice were critically creative and different. They put animation over intricate art design, or simply using a very interesting choice of art style from mediocre to substantially alluring artwork. And we finally get to see some semantic puns dude lmao. We finally get to see some witty dialogue from the original serie's style of attracting people to watch the anime, for its essence of a great dialogic attraction and ornate philosophical writing. And          
                              As someone who has read through the Kizumonogatari novel multiple times, this film is to me personally is a damn near perfect adaptation.
                              As you enter Nekketsu-hen, the point in the story finally building upon the concepts of humanity and selflessness, where we finally get to the real fight scenes of the movies, it's a little bit hard to shake the feeling that it's constantly, if subtly, off. It's easy to miss the first watch, and if you can brush this feeling aside and enjoy it you'll totally and fully love it anyway. But it feels a bit barebones and skimping on key moments that result in a wobbly progression throughout.",62

After being rescued from the Colossal and Armored Titans, Eren Yaeger devotes himself to improving his Titan form. Krista Lenz struggles to accept the loss of her friend, Captain Levi chooses Eren and his friends to form his new personal squad, and Commander Erwin Smith recovers from his injuries.

The Survey Corps' recent successes have drawn attention, and a familiar face from Levi's past is sent to collect the wanted soldiers. Sought after by the government, Levi and his new squad must evade their adversaries in hopes of keeping Eren and Krista safe.

In Shingeki no Kyojin Season 3, Eren and his fellow soldiers are not only fighting for their survival against the terrifying Titans, but also against the terror of a far more conniving foe: humans.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.6,8,66,43,1247353,15486,"                              In a desolate world where corruption, power, and control rules all, Attack on Titan feels like a story that goes far deeper than just survival. As someone who has been following the series for several years, this franchise has really made a reputation. I’m not even talking about the commercial sales revenue or fan base. I’m talking about how this show evolved from a war between Humans and Titans.
                              Other than the male x male shipping, I am not finding many reasons to like this show anymore.
                              *Minimum Spoiler Review*
                              So, they decided to make a second cour apart. To be honest this is very annoying, we have to wait, but it's okay. It's better than wait for four years.
                              As always this incredible anime has overcome any expectations that people have set for it. The first part of season 3 was amazing, well executed, the sped up pacing (compared to the manga), the visuals and the music were top notch.
                              There are few anime these years that are as bloody and brutal as Attack on Titan is, yet don’t use gore in an overly immature way. Although the series itself has generated much hate and criticism, I still believe it has more depth than most people give credit for. From the very first season, we get to see gruesome events of shock and horror, as well as the point of views of numerous soldiers who had to make sacrifices. It sends a message that shows humanity’s determination and resilience even in hopeless situations. It shows that, even though humans have the capacity for selfishness and

                              5s Across the board.... For F--k Sake...
                              Since it is a split cour, time to make a review. I really looked forward for this season of Shingeki no Kyojin. In the trailer, they showed us that Levi is the main focus of this arc. Then on Ep.1, they introduced us (with the best way possible) to Kenny, the ""main villain"" of this arc/season and the one who took care of Levi when he was a kid. The first 2 eps delivered the hype. At that point my rating is a 7/10. They showed what I came for. A Levi centered arc. 
                              I went back and forth on what I should rate this anime and I think I actually gave it a little bit too much credit. Let me start by saying that this is the most overrated anime of all time. Season one was good, season 2 was ok, but season 3 was just...words can't even describe how bad it was. Because of all the hype I decided to watch Attack on Titan, after watching season 1 I really liked the show but it eventually started to feel like your average everyday anime. Mc has some awesome power, gets mad and exposes it to everyone, and          
                               Given the nature of today's media consumption, rarely does anything 'stick' unless constant updates are provided to keep out attention.  Wit Studio's faltering in releasing the second season of AoT has resulted in the series's current lack of attention, which is a shame because it's only gotten better since its first season.  
                              From the mysteries of the second season, now the third season takes the reins with political upheaval along with all those mysteries uncovered and still withstanding in the first and second seasons...with varying degrees of success.
                              By the time this season premiered, I had read and been keeping up with the Attack on Titan manga, so I knew already what to expect while going into this season. Season 3 covers the ""Uprising Arc,"" which is an extremely different turn from what we have normally been seeing in Attack on Titan so far--humans vs. titans. This arc takes on a more political stance and looks at the relationships between humans living in the walls.
                              So, this is the season where everything starts to make sense. All the flaming questions we all had are starting to come together, finally, after more than 30 episodes. Can I just take a moment to appreciate the wonderful suspense this anime has? It wouldn't be the same if they just straight up got into it in the first seasons. And they're even letting space for more - actually, WAY more. The only thing I missed about this part was the fights - but as someone that is now starting the second part, I can tell: there are plenty.",65

Naturally, a new anime installment of Hajime no Ippo did excite me. I mean, with New Challenger ending, the animators have nearly 60 volumes to catch up on as opposed to being 60 volumes ahead unlike a certain Studio Pierrot series which you can easily conclude is. 
                              Intro:
                              First of all a big thanks to George Morikawa because he did something nearly impossible with Hajime no Ippo. He managed to keep his story interesting and his comedy fresh even after all these years. Sure it has it’s weaknesses(for example some short chapters in the manga plus some repeated stuff in the story etc) but it is still a great accomplishment that only a few are capable of.
                              I think I just wrote review for this season in a panel made for Hajime No Ippo: new Challenger 
                              I'm a huge Hajime no Ippo fan, I love the anime and manga, so when I heard of this latest season coming out I was excited because some of my favourite fights from the manga were going to be animated. 
                              I watched this straight after New Challenger, and it blew me away just as much.
                              This anime is by far my #1 favorite. In this review I will not just be reviewing Rising, but the entirety of the anime seasons (Hajime No Ippo, New Challenger, and Rising). The movies themselves are good, but will not be included here.
                              Please note before continuing I reference my reviews on the previous installments of Hajime no Ippo a little bit in this review so you might be a little lost if you haven't read the first two.",67

                              Once again Ufotable x Type-Moon did not disappoint. Watching it in the cinema (in Japan) with proper loudspeakers can enable me to experience the thrill of this fantastic display of animation choreography. The amount of time and effort by Ufotable once again demonstrates its class in perfecting high-quality animation and its visual arts. The unlimited budget work studio took time off from anime series and dedicate all their resources into this project and came out in fruition, and I could not be prouder for them. 
                              ""I'm not a virgin. My first time was quite a long time ago. That's not all. Ever since that first time, my body has been touched by unnatural things. I don't deserve to be protected by you!""
                              Lost Butterfly is a nightmare. A violent, corrosive nightmare. Gone is the dread that Presage Flower bathed in, as terror strikes in its place. The Holy Grail War is no longer just contaminated, it's corrupted. All that's left to do is watch the fireworks as everything goes to hell.
                                   Heaven's Feel: Lost Butterfly does a great deal to improve upon Presage Flower and feels like a breathe of fresh air for the Fate/Stay Night franchise. While Presage Flower had to retread some of the ground Unlimited Blade Works and Fate laid, this new film does a lot to show you what is new this time around and the much more intense and dark direction the series takes.

It seems like the greatness of Fate/Zero and the entertaining Fate UBW has forever faded in the shadow of doubts. But fortunately, this time, ufotable has learnt their lessons.

Seeds of doubt are sown between Kiritsugu Emiya and Saber, his Servant, as their conflicting ideologies on heroism and chivalry clash. Meanwhile, an ominous bond forms between Kirei Kotomine, who still seeks to find his purpose in life, and one of the remaining Servants.

Of course, anyone who has read or watched Fate/Stay Night knows the outcome of the fourth Holy Grail War, but only half the fun of a journey is the destination. Gen Urobuchi and studio Ufotable guide us through a magnificent world saturated with dynamic characters, a beautiful score, jaw-dropping visuals and fluctuating idealistic views, which all congeal into a compelling narrative. Mistakes are made by Ufotable, but compared to the grandiose story and execution they only serve

                              The Holy Grail War: A war fought between seven selected masters and their servants to determine a sole victor, who will then bless one miracle upon the world. The Holy Grail War can either bring about an ideal wish that saves innocent lives or lead to chaotic destruction in the process. Or both. The Fate Zero series' plot circles around the Holy Grail War, its history and its future. The previous season focused on the characters' backgrounds, and in this season it is now all-out war. 
                              For a show that heavily relies on dialogue, it sure was lacking in the quality of dialogue. I often found myself bored with whatever they were talking about, mainly because the plot was boring and all the characters had many unappealing traits which made me not care about them. 
                              This review considers the anime adaptation of Fate Zero (F/Z) Season 2 entirely on its own merit.
                              For the love of Holy Grail, if you have never watched anything from Fate/Stay Night franchise under any circumstances DO NOT watch Fate/Zero first! I'll hold an even stronger statement - don't watch it at all. I've just made this grievous mistake, because I had listened to advice given on youtube by several self-proclaimed anime gurus. And now how pissed I am! Sheesh! Firstly, it ruined much of the experience of Fate/Stay Night. And secondly, I strongly believe Fate/Zero is crap.
                              Fate Zero 2nd Season review:
                              This review analyzes the entirety of Fate/Zero, not secluded to one seasoned release. Firstly, Fate/Zero is a prequel to the stories of ""Fate/stay night"". ""Fate/stay night"" originated as a visual novel and later was released as an anime in 2006. That anime, while it does succeed in some ways to its own right, is something that should be taken as its own entity as it can be considered a failure of being an accurate adaptation of the source material. The visual novel itself comprised of three stories that all are tied to this one. Two of those are currently being brought up in anime-form by          
                              Fate/Zero was entertaining at times, with several very good fight sequences and the nice animation, but it doesn't make up for the real lack of any sort of coherent story or character development. Fate/Zero has simple plot hiding behind rhetoric and long-winded speeches from rooftops just to look cool. The dialogue was uninspired at best and often times so dull that I felt that I could walk away to make a cup of coffee and come back knowing I missed absolutely nothing that contributed to the story.
                              Tyrannical power and glory are two things that define a sovereign ruler with an iron fist. Many mythologies have been interpreted to fit these notions into their stories to create a different understanding of them. A series that has been long regarded with acclaim by many die-hard enthusiasts is the Fate series. Starting as a visual novel series, it eventually shifted its form to animation with Fate Stay Night to mediocre reception from fans. It was then that a man named Gen Urobuchi decided to make a prequel light novel series called Fate Zero, and thus a legendary phenomenon was born in animation form four

After all, Hori has a perfect combination of beauty and brains, while Miyamura appears meek and distant to his fellow classmates. However, a fateful meeting between the two lays both of their hidden selves bare. Even though she is popular at school, Hori has little time to socialize with her friends due to housework. On the other hand, Miyamura lives under the noses of his peers, his body bearing secret tattoos and piercings that make him look like a gentle delinquent.

Having opposite personalities yet sharing odd similarities, the two quickly become friends and often spend time together in Hori's home. As they both emerge from their shells, they share with each other a side of themselves concealed from the outside world.

                              Anime touting a gimmick always worry me. They throw in these attention grabbers in an attempt to say ""Hey look! I boast something different than those other shows of the same genre and concept as me, come and watch!"" But they often end up being entirely one dimensional because they solely revovolve around that one singular idea. Then the author realizes that they actually need more than a unique shtick to write a story and fail to craft an engaging narrative filled with expressive characters to support it. Whoops!

                              A show containing the typical elements you would find in most Shoujo: the bishounen tropes where guys are drawn prettier than girls, colorful sparkling backgrounds for short scenes that are supposed to be cute and a school romance atmosphere intended to make the heart of teen girls go dokidoki depicting the usual (unrealistic) fantasies girls have around that age:
                              Normally don't watch a lot of romance animes, or don't have a major interest in them. But this show is far different for me. To the point I'm for sure am gonna read the manga afterwards because of how great I find it. It's one of the best of the season, and let me explain why.
                              This show is the definition of mid.
                              My review contains spoilers, so read at your own risk.
                              Overall: 7/10
                              I’ve been hearing about Horimiya manga for a while, yet it hasn’t caught my attention at all, then the anime aired, so I watched a couple of episodes out of pure curiosity, and it managed to totally and completely catch my attention.
                              Reducing my rating from 5 to 3 after the last episode.
                              When watching Horimiya one question constantly grazes through my head; if only. If only they had given ANY time for character development and backstory before making the relationship progress rapidly in minutes, maybe then I could actually care about the characters. It's laughable that the premise is *oh my god this girl and boy who look a certain way at school actually have completely different personalities!* - why is it laughable? The premise is done and explored within the first 4 minutes of episode one. It doesn't even give the viewer time to fully grasp the preconceived self of the mc's, no it does not.          
                              WARNING!! this contains some references to the manga but no spoilers pass episode 4, i only reference chapters that were skipped in the 4 episodes.
                              Every so often there comes a story that is truly groundbreaking, it goes a direction no one had ever thought to go before and changes the anime landscape forever. Horimiya...isn't that, the premise is extremely basic; the loner guy and the popular girl find out they have more in common than they thought. He was a boy, she was a girl, can I make it any more obvious? How about if I literally name the story after their ship name?
                              I loved the manga so I'm glad that the anime is keeping up with the expectations! I'm really happy with the casting, all the voices fit the characters so well!",70

Some episode manage to make me touched with every single character they have and made me care for them like what happend to them after that? how are they doing now? is Natsume going to be straight or gay? Taki or someone?
                              It's Natsume Yuujinchou. If you aren't following this series, you've either not tried it or slice of life anime is just not for you. That's okay if you don't like slower shows. Otherwise... Join us in the iyashikei world, where the world is good and pureness reigns and smiles are protected! Go! We'll see you at Roku!
                              The fifth season of Natsume Yuujinchou was a true pleasure to watch. In this season, we see Natsume's friendships develop and grow. We learn more about his troubled past and the backstory behind the Fujiwaras. 
                              It is more of the same thing that was in previous seasons: A somewhat melancholic, calm slice of life kind of show that deals with supernatural elements. If you watched and liked previous seasons, you'll like this one as well.
                              I almost went into labor when I knew that Natsume Yuujinchou got a new season. And ooommmggg, it were four long years of waiting, goddammit! I thought they had canceled the animation projects, but then this came out and I became extremely happy to continue watching the adaptation of one of the best Shoujo manga (if not THE best) that exists in the manga market. Geez, I don't know if I'm able to tell in this review how much excited and sincerely pleased I'm right now. Finally!
                              Alright, so the longer I watch this anime, the harder it is to review. Here's the thing about this anime: it grows on you. The things that I would've wanted to be changed before, I don't want them to be changed anymore. 
                              I'm so happy to see a new season of Natsume Yuujinchou, I thought it would not going to happen. It is, no doubt, my favorite anime. Good story, great characters, with a calm e heartwarming atmosphere. Some episodes will make you laugh, some episodes will make you cry, but most of them will make you calm. My heart  fills with happiness everytime I watch Natsume Yuujinchou.",72

However, the real challenge is only just beginning: if they are unable to compete with the artist Eiji Niizuma in the rankings within the span of six months, they will be canceled. To top it off, numerous rivals are close behind and declaring war. They don't even have enough time to spare thinking about an anime!

In Bakuman. 3rd Season, Muto Ashirogi must find a way to stay atop the colossal mountain known as the Shounen Jack rankings. With new problems and new assistants, the pair continue to strive for their dream.

Whether it's getting securing your ideal job, marrying someone you always admired, or becoming a superstar, dreams require many ingredients to make it come true. It requires hard work, determination, motivation, creativity, and even a little luck. Yet, when people follows these dreams, it can be surprising on how much they realize about their goal and about themselves. In Bakuman 3, the series follows two best friends who hopes to achieve their dreams and become professional manga artists.
                              Bakuman 3 is a great continuation of the series. I enjoyed watching it and I can definitely say that it will be worth your time as well. Here's the review.
                              Let's get things straight - this series is amazingly good. I want you to have that in mind as you read on since I would like to write about all 3 seasons and not just this one - I would like to sum up my experiences with the entire package. 
                              *This review Covers the Third Season of Bakuman and Spoilers are included
                              What a great anime ! I think  it was the best season of all 3 , the quality of the art was a little better , the drama and the romance was more intense than the other 2 seasons , but what I really enjoyed in this one was the work of "" Ashirogi Moto "" and the great challenges between theme and Niizuma , it was both exciting and enjoyable to watch . I definitely think the serie of bakuman was one of best series I've watched so far , simply because of the unique story and the nice touch of comedy that

                              This is a *Spoiler* Free review. So you don't have pay me. Just kidding.
                              This is not a review only of Bakuman 3 but of all seasons so far.
                              Bakuman was originally a manga which got turned into an anime which is about the main characters trying to get it big in the manga industry in order to get an anime to fulfill their dreams.
                              This anime is about the love story of Mashiro and Azuki in a unique way, even though they work apart in a very far place to each other, they still got in contact  and will married after Mashiro gets an anime and Azuki was able to voice act in Mashiro's anime. Mashiro works together with Takagi, Takagi being the writer and Mashiro being the drawer. Mahiro has an uncle who died of working too hard, his uncle had teaches Mashiro so many things about being a Mangaka. Both Takagi and Mashiro work together in the title of Ashirogi Muto, Ashirogi Muto had a really          
                              Bakuman is all about following your dream in life, how you should never give up and instead continue to strife to reach your goal no matter what. 
                              To find a friend who shares the same passion, to be able to marry your crush when the dream that you share with her becomes true, to have supporting family, rivals with same goal that keep motivating each other, ones that guide you to your path and to chase the dream of life. Bakuman has been one hell of a ride.
                              It's been a long journey since the first season of Bakuman. It is such an amazing story, everyone has to watch it! 
                              BAKUMAN IN GENERAL: a perfect anime does not need to be explained in so many words said that this masterpiece showing pure reality of the life of a mangaka , I recommend it for those who have time in the world of anime , and can appreciate art and reality in this anime , someone who is not totally immersed in the world of anime could not give full appreciation of this anime and see him leaving would end before finding that this anime is considered a work of art",73
77,"The entire countryside comes to a halt midday to witness a rare solar eclipse that is rumored to allow the average person to see Mushi. Unable to avert their gaze, the air is full of awe and wonder—but those who know the Mushi are preparing for the eclipse's aftermath.

Based on a prediction from Tanyuu Karibusa, the cursed recorder, Mushishi Ginko finds himself in a very unlucky farming village. Immediately following the solar eclipse, a strange black cloud begins to gather in the sky and blocks the sun once more. Suspecting it to be the work of a Mushi known as Hihami, Ginko seeks to liberate the village from perpetual darkness. However, it seems that not all of the villagers are eager to return to the light.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.57,8,79,1343,106062,173,"                              Do not take anything for granted, not even life itself. This simple yet profound message is splendidly conveyed by another episode of the calming drug called ""Mushishi"". What an adventure this series has been; watching Ginko investigating various mushi species in a clever but always comprehensible way, not only curing every human in need of help whatever their origin, but also depicting the essence of life.
                              2006 marks the last airing of Mushishi, a small journey within a rural Shinto-inspired Japan. It is, in essence, about harmony—emanating the struggle for humans to find balance in their lives and to attain kiyome (""purity"") among the cycles of nature. Prospects of a sequel have been teased for a while now, and as time passed, hopeful fans were beginning to lose faith. Now, 8 years later, studio Artland and director Hiroshi Nagahama relaunch the series with a one hour-long Mushishi episode, entitled ""Hihamukage"" (""Sun-Eating Shade"").
                              Watching Mushishi is not just a mystifying experience but one that you will remember by for its atmosphere of exquisite presentation. Through understanding, Mushishi presents problems but also solutions in which main protagonist Ginko solves throughout his journey. As a journeyman, Ginko takes on the road once again in this special OVA that chronicles his expedition.
                              There's a perpetual sense of wisdom that can be attributed to the series called Mushishi. Each story is unique and offers a diverse spectrum of intricate stories. These stories often portray something similar to life lessons and are beautiful representations of teaching tolerance through a creative medium of animation. Despite this feeling of attaining an essence of enlightenment and understanding, it's also quite difficult to express what the actual lessons are that you've learned. That's the beauty of Mushishi.
                              Let me first remind you what I thought of the TV series. I adored it. The subtle storyline, the calming feeling, the idea of small creatures that are mostly misunderstood taking roles in peoples lives. I love everything about it. It doesn’t go as surprising then that I really love this special then, right? It just felt like a long episode from the TV series. The storyline and soft music was a perfect match to it.
                              The new special was a shock to us all. Mushishi is, well let’s be blunt, an older series – and being “old” (returning after almost nine years have passed) it has all the charms of seeing an old friend after a long time. Or falling into your bed after being away from home a long time. The world is nebulous, the time frame uncertain, but it is unquestionable blend of Japanese folktales, pre-industrialization Japan and modern world technology. Like the word itself, viewers can suspend belief when it comes to the supernatural mushi. And that belief has a kind of subtle magic. For fans, the          
                              Alright, here we go. This'll be a short one, but let's talk about this special episode of Mushishi. 
                              Now I loved mushishi.I thought it was clever,emotional,beautiful and philosophical all at the same time. This series came out in 2005 and now that in 2014 a special and a second season were announced I was very excited. It took me a while to get to but I am finally starting my crusade to watch all of the fairly new mushishi content we have been presented with.But enough of my rambling now onto the review.Mushishi Special: Hihamukage is a 45 minute special and is the kickstart to the slew of mushishi content to grace us in 2014. So what makes this special so amazing? Well          
                              Mushishi Special: Hihamukage is the continuation of the the original series of Mushishi, serving as an interlude between the original and later seasons. ",77
78,"The seemingly ordinary and unimpressive Saitama has a rather unique hobby: being a hero. In order to pursue his childhood dream, he trained relentlessly for three years—and lost all of his hair in the process. Now, Saitama is incredibly powerful, so much so that no enemy is able to defeat him in battle. In fact, all it takes to defeat evildoers with just one punch has led to an unexpected problem—he is no longer able to enjoy the thrill of battling and has become quite bored.

This all changes with the arrival of Genos, a 19-year-old cyborg, who wishes to be Saitama's disciple after seeing what he is capable of. Genos proposes that the two join the Hero Association in order to become certified heroes that will be recognized for their positive contributions to society, and Saitama, shocked that no one knows who he is, quickly agrees. And thus begins the story of One Punch Man, an action-comedy that follows an eccentric individual who longs to fight strong enemies that can hopefully give him the excitement he once felt and just maybe, he'll become popular in the process.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.57,8,80,5,2144141,54772,"                              This is a complete review after watching all 12 episodes of One Punch Man.
                              There are only two types of people in the world: one who absolutely love One Punch Man, and other who strongly dislike it for being too predictable. Now finally that the anime is over, I can review it properly. 
                              When it comes to satires and parodies alike, there really isn't any sort of arithmetic equation or analytical evaluation needed to determine its value. To put it as simply, it all boils down to a rudimentary question: were you kept amused and were you entertained? 
                              One-Punch Man is pretty much exactly like what it sounds. We got a bald guy named Saitama who literally beats his opponents with a single punch. He is so powerful that throughout his life, he gets bored with the opponent he fights with. Because when a guy like him can beat up opponents with just one punch, it doesn’t get very fun right? Regardless, Saitama has a heart of gold and in this series, we follow his daily adventures as a hero, as the man who one punches his enemies.
                              After finishing this show I have concluded that it certainly lives up to its name. Oh no no, not the majority opinion of it, silly goose, I mean the actual show title, “One Punch Man,” because this show genuinely does only have ONE joke, and it gets old very, very fast.
                              One Punch Man is a comedy/parody shounen anime. Unfortunately it fails as a parody and it fails as a shounen.
                              Story: 5 (so-so only)
                              Goddamn, last season was heavy on the shonen/superhero stuff, wasn't it? Seraph of the End: Battle in Nagoya. Ushio and Tora. Noragami Aragoto. And of course, the most popular one of them all, One Punch Man. It's going to be difficult to find something new to say about each of them, but lord knows I'm going to try my damndest to do so. Might as well start with the one that got everyone's attention, even if not for all the right reasons. I mean it's a giant understatement to say that I wasn't the only one who watched One Punch Man, but it's also a          
                              With One-Punch Man finished airing, there is one thing anyone can agree on, and that is how split the community is about the show: there are people who absolutely love it, considering it the pinnacle of their experience, and others that consider it to be very bland and boring, with terrible humour. Now the question is whether these opinions on the show are justified or not, and naturally it is, on both sides. Is One-Punch Man overrated? Yes, it is. But is it mediocre, bad? No, in my opinion it is not, it's an enjoyable anime with fantastic animation and action.
                              Every year there is at least one particular show that receives massive coverage for whatever reason.In 2015, without a question was One Punch Man's year in the spotlight and for good reason; the initial premise of One Punch seemed to be a goldmine, for it was thought to be a clever,satiristic view of the shonen and action anime that has been dominate since the last decade. 
                              Jesus christ, calm the fuck down. It's a pretty good anime. It is neither the greatest nor the worst thing to ever be produced, contrary to how most people seem to be treating it.
                              One Punch Man was a fairly popular anime from the tail end of last year. It was based off of a webcomic by One, which has also been adapted into a manga. The anime came from Madhouse, which could be good or bad and there's no real way to ascertain which it is just because it has a lot of fans. After all, some of the worst anime I've seen have had pretty substantive fan bases. Then again, just last week I reviewed Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex: 2nd Gig, which was both popular and really good. So, let's take a look and          
                              “Saitama”, I guess that name often heard by all of the anime fans out there including me this lately. Well, that makes sense because this anime One Punch Man that adapted from a manga remake by Yusuke Murata and originally written by ONE has caught a large attention through it series. As most people knew, there’s pro and contra that shows up among anime fans out there about this show and because of that, I feel that I have to watch this no matter what. And now I finally did it so I’m gonna present this review of me for this anime. For more 20          
                              One Punch Man is an action comedy anime. If you expect deep meening, you're done. If you expect horror or something meaningfull, you're watching the wrong anime.
                              One Punch Man is a highly accurate parody of the shonen and superhero genres. It mimics them with stunning precision.",78

                              Youth.
                              I was hoping Sora yori mo Tooi Basho be an anime where cute girls wear ridiculously puffy winter coats against winter scenery, an adventure approached with the comfy manner. Instead this series focused too much on the serious side and contained loads of drama. 
                              This year—that is 2018, to warm up your Winter with an adventurous slice of life, Madhouse has brought close to you A Place Further Than The Universe.
                              Have you ever thought that life is meaningless? 
                              Journey. This one word has a heap of meanings behind its back. Why do we travel? The reasons range from being a collective success of mankind to discover a new plateau to just the sheer joy and curiosity that is obtained from setting foot in a new land. The air, the atmosphere, the scent... these things feel so different and anew and there is a kind of refreshment that you can only find in yourself after the exploration of an unknown place.
                              How would I describe this anime in 5 words? Realistic. Hilarious. Dramatic. Journey. Incredible.
                              This is not only the best anime of Winter 2018, which already imo was a really strong season, but it's one of my favorite anime series ever now. This series is not only an argument for the best things anime can do as a medium, but a full refutation of the idea that ""cute girls doing cute things"" is somehow a lesser form of the medium. This series is as inspiring, as heart-wrenching, as memorable, and as affecting as any of the most beloved anime series, and the team behind it deserve true kudos for indeed going on their own Impossible Journey and risking so

                              Adventuring is a unique experience that only a select few have enjoyed in their lives.
                              This is an anime that I'm sure many of you have heard about. Maybe hearing about it through various anime reviews with many people praising it for it's writing and called the anime of the winter 2018 season. But for me, I watch this long after the season has ended so I didn't get hyped and enjoyed to the fullest in my opinion. 
                              this ain't a slice of life moeshit that takes place in antarctica. in fact, most of this damn show doesn't even take PLACE in antarctica. ",79

However, the boon of this lifestyle leaves them unprepared when an unknown, hostile threat arises due to the ever-growing human population. This calamity is the Anti-Spiral—a fearsome enemy with unparalleled power. 

As the Spiral King's prognosis postulating the destruction of ""The Spiral's World"" begins to come true, the pieces are in place, and Team Dai-Gurren is ready. With his late brother's hope to see a better future for mankind, Simon—along with Nia Teppelin and the rest of the team—is determined to overthrow the mighty Anti-Spiral in order to revive humanity's lost hope.

The second recap movie that introduces loads of new mechs to the Gurren Lagann multiverse is just as stunning as the original series was. Be warned as this review contains spoilers to the original Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann and the first movie. *The reason I purposely left out individual scores is because I can safely say that I was biased during watching this film, and I will thus be biased towards writing this review. Note: I am pro-Gurren Lagann and all for manly          
                              Lagann-hen is an exhilarating production with a setting of monumental proportions, though not without its flaws, which - in some cases - are unfortunately more apparent than in the first installment.
                              To write a spoiler-free review of lagann-hen is difficult, especially since there is quite some variation from the show. However, I will write this review on the basis that I don't want to spoil TTGL or Lagann-hen. 
                              Lagann hen  was a huge dissapointment for me.
                              This movie wasn&#039;t that great at some parts but I must say the ending was more epic then it needed to be then in the anime. They went over epically insane that I thought it would never end. The story wasn&#039;t that bad unlike the 1st movie and the music was still great and I wasn&#039;t as disappointed as I was the first.          
                              Oh my god. This might just be the best thing I've ever seen. When you thought you couldn't see anything not even close as epic as Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann's anime, the only thing that can top Gurren Lagann... is Gurren Lagann itself. 
                              *I'm writing this review for people mainly who have already seen Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, and will hopefully be worded in such a way that there aren't spoilers for the show for those who haven't seen TTGL.  I HIGHLY encourage those who haven't seen TTGL, to see it FIRST.*  
                              I'm not the type of person to watch anime films that re-cap an already completed series. However, being the huge Gurren Lagann fan that I am, I had to make an exception for this. By the time I finished these two films, I thought it was well worth it.
                              ""Listen, Simon. Don't Believe in yourself, Believe in ME! Believe in the Kamina who believes in you!""
                              I didn't think it could get better than episode 25 and 26 of Gurren Lagann. My God, was I wrong. Not only is TTGL a worthy conclusion to the series, it completely blows the anime away. The redone animation, updated visuals, fightscenes and new scenes are just perfect. In the anime, I didn't really feel any connection to NIa nor sad when she died. This time around, I was legit crying. I'm glad they changed a few other character deaths around too. My one complaint is the Kamina scene from episode 26 is not quite as sad here.  The music was perfect and I          
                                     When you thought you couldn't see anything not even close as epic as TTGL series, when you wonder how the hell could enough Spiral energy could be reunited in order to create such a brilliant masterpiece of a series, is when you notice that only one thing can beat TTGL: TTGL itself.
                              In order to watch this film one must first complete the series. As the movie would become very confusing. 
                              ""Get going, Simon. Don't let the what-ifs, maybes, and if-onlys distract you. The one thing that you choose yourself, that is the truth of your universe.""
                              The 2nd TTGL movie is a big improvement over the first one. More than half of the movie is based on new materials, making the story flows much better than the first movie. 
                              A great movie, for those that saw Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann anime, I have to reccomend it, most of the scenes of the are re-used were, it a couple of new ones for the final battle and others... I gave this a 9,because most of the stuff I have already experienced on the anime, even though, this movie made me relive everything I liked about the anime, which I finished a couple of weeks ago so I M was already aware of what I was going to get, it had impact, but not as much as the 27 episodes, what is perfectly fine. It consists          ",80
81,"As with its prequel, Zoku Natsume Yuujinchou is about Takashi Natsume, a boy who has had the ability to see youkai since he was young, and his bodyguard youkai Madara, nicknamed Nyanko-sensei. Natsume attempts to return names written in his ""Book of Friends"" (which he inherited from his grandmother Reiko) to youkai in his village. Throughout these adventures, he meets some youkai that are friendly, some that want to steal the Book, and some that want to kill him, as Natsume learns about himself and his relationship with these mysterious beings along the way.

                              Ahahaha~ I rated everything a ten. No. I'm not some mindless idiot who thought this series was the best thing since sliced bread. I'm a fellow reviewer who KNOWS this series is the best thing since sliced bread. Anyway, on with the review!
                              ""Continuing the path that must be done""
                              NOTE: Since the content in all three seasons is similar enough that they don't warrant separate reviews, they will all be covered here. The fourth will be edited in when it finishes, unless it differs heavily from the first three by the end of its run.
                              What makes an anime great?  Is it purely a mix of great story, well made animation and soundtrack and engaging characters?  Or does an anime need something extra to be regarded as truly great?  Some kind of x-factor that makes you feel like you’re watching something special?  I believe that a great anime needs both; that the x-factor that separates those shows you give 9 or 10 out of 10 from the others is created by having the great story, animation and so on.  I used to believe that this mix could only be obtained through complexity, with unexpected twists          
                              This series is a sequel to ""Natsume Yuujinchou"" which tells the story of a high school boy with the ability to see yokai. The plot revolves around his growing involvement with both the yokai and the people around him.

                              Loneliness, they are so overrated.
                              In the first moments of the series, what I automatically enjoyed was the altruistic view of the main character, Natsume Takashi. I had not the feeling of an overwhelming strong, stubborned or desperate human, just a cheerful guy who wants to help any person in danger.
                              Zoku Natsume is an example of a sequel done right. Like the first season, this show has all of the aesthetically pleasing things you cherished. The tone is still light-hearted, and often peaceful and mellow. Many times throughout this season you will feel a sort of familiar peace, and even melancholy. Finishing the season will without a doubt, leave you lonely, which is certainly ironic, considering the entire season, and show for that matter, has the idea of loneliness, and even to an extent, romanticizes it. 
                              Allow me to create a sub-genre of anime in which this particular one fits right in. I'd like to put this anime into the Zoo genre of anime. The Zoo genre is an anime which has some special monster or some unique creature within the show. Each episode introduces and focuses on one particular type of that creature. Shows like Mushishi, Fruits Basket, and Panty and Stocking all qualify for this genre of anime. In Natsume Yuujinchou's case, the monster is the Youkai, the demon-like beings which only Natsume, the main hero, can see. 
                              Im going to try to keep this as simple as possible for all you out there wondering what it's all about! 
                              I find this season so hard to review because it's literally the exact same as the first season. At least where it counts.
                              It’s already bad that the first season was very short, so when it ended I was genuinely sad yet irritated. Why can’t they make this amazing series longer! So I am so much grateful that it continues.
                              In this season, we see the seasons change from Winter to Spring as it continues to bring us this feel-good, warm fuzzy feeling that leaves you smiling. The change of seasons as if to reflect the shift in character in Natsume as well. It continues to tell us the story of the characters and Natsume fighting their everyday battles, loneliness and trying to gain acceptance from the people around them. ",81

                              Overall: 9
                              The 5th chapter of Kara no Kyoukai brings a new level of epicness to the series. Chapter 5 is arguably the most exciting chapter of the movie series, it surely lived up to its expectations!
                              Given that I haven't rated any of the other Kara no Kyoukai movies below an 8, the harsh drop here certainly disturbs the graph. Indeed, a 6 might seem incongruous—and for the acclaimed fifth movie of all things! Rather than waste everyone's time by ill-advisedly trying to compress this movie's problems into a pithy introductory hook, I'll simply quote the antagonist, Souren Araya, as he expounds upon his villainous motivations in a dying speech near the end of this movie, the second-lengthiest in the Kara no Kyoukai franchise. Read aloud in sonorous tones for full impact.
                              idk man i watched that movie now and i feel weirdly depressed after that. i dont know what it is about those movies but they just leave me confused and unsatisfied. when i watched the first 3 movies i still had hope, educated myself on the storyline, tried to see through all this mess and understand the plot better. but now after the 5th movie where you would expect some kind of satisfaction and knowledge, it still feels unfamiliar and strange to me.

                              I watched this movie two times. The first time I thought it was very impressive, from the animation to the story itself. After the second time, however, I have a very different opinion.
                              This is part 5 of the KnK series
                              Welcome, My Friends to film festival week. For those of you who don't remember, I did this in February of last year looking at Kara no Kyoukai 2 & 3, Ghost in the Shell, Animal Crossing, Blood the last Vampire, Night on the Galactic Railroad & End of Evangelion. This year I'm going to start out the same way I did last year, with another look at Kara no Kyoukai. To give a brief recap of how the series has scored so far, the first film was slow and incredibly stupid. The second film was suspenseful and good. The third film was okay but could          
                              If you are looking for something that could blow your mind away, this is what you WANT to check out. First thing that sticks out a mile is blood. Blood and gore. But unlike previous Kara no Kyoukai movies Mujun Rasen is a little bit less bloody and is more focused on action and story, which as I dare to think, makes it a lot more attractive. But it definetly kept that dark ambience of predecessors, and it is still Kara no Kyoukai. So It seems like after four inconsequent movies which made a sort of introduction, we finally got a perfect complete movie. 
                              Kara no Kyoukai 5: Mujun Rasen (Paradox Paradigm) review
                              Out of the 7 movies of the ""Garden of Sinners"" series, this is my personal favorite. It combines all the best aspects of the series in one complete package in terms of a well-scripted plot, art direction and atmosphere. The editing and visual imagery consist of some of the most imaginative and compelling of this series, or of any other.
                              The fifth installment of the Kara no Kyoukai of the movies but in chronological its a continues of the first movies kara no kyoukai 1:fukan fukei......at his movies,viewer will facing a really confusing while watching it,some scene will suddenly appeared that not follow the route of the whole story,that really make the viewer think ''what happens''.''how that happens'' and ''when that happens'',the unique about this movies is that 2 story but with different scene being combine to 1 story that really answered whole the story of it....at this movies,viewer will be introduce with the mastermind whose responsibility for whole the tragedy and and why he          ",82

                              Sksks, this is my first review so apologies if its wordy and stupid sounding lol! 
                              Quick Thoughts:
                              Tohru Honda literally changed me as a person. 
                              Fruits Basket: Sisterhood
                              You know, I remember coming out of the last season of this and thinking I had no idea what the overarching story was. Thankfully, this season finally told me. I more or less only want to talk about story in this review as I feel like most of my thoughts about this season come from that, so here it goes.
                              This show is way too highly rated. The first season was honestly very good, it brought up a good story and developed an interesting main cast. But the second season fell apart in my opinion. From my understanding the manga came before the first release of the anime at the turn of the century, but that doesn't help the fact that the cast of characters in S2 is just too big. There is no reason a show so driven on emotional attachment to the characters should try to stretch itself so thin. When I watched S1, I fell in love with all the main cast,          
                              It really surpirsed how this season was able to put out great episodes week-in and week-out. 
                              What does it mean to change? What is the name of that feeling of fear that comes with the thought of wanting to stretch out your hand and go beyond of the bubble that you’ve trapped yourself in? And truly, what does it mean to be happy and form genuine bonds in this twisted game we call Life?
                              For me,Fruits basket it’s the best of its genre.
                              Season 2: 25 Episodes (about 20 minutes each)
                              So, anime is usually the only medium in which I go for romance stories, and this one hit me right in the feels at just the right time.  This season is significantly better if only for the fact that Tohru is not a literal conveyor belt for all the boys feelings anymore.  There's some degree of initiative finally, which is nice.  Additionally, I fell for Hatsuharu so damn hard (as evidenced by my new profile pic), and getting to explore his (and the other Zodiacs) story more was really nice.

85,"Idly indulging in baseless paranormal activities with the Occult Club, high schooler Yuuji Itadori spends his days at either the clubroom or the hospital, where he visits his bedridden grandfather. However, this leisurely lifestyle soon takes a turn for the strange when he unknowingly encounters a cursed item. Triggering a chain of supernatural occurrences, Yuuji finds himself suddenly thrust into the world of Curses—dreadful beings formed from human malice and negativity—after swallowing the said item, revealed to be a finger belonging to the demon Sukuna Ryoumen, the ""King of Curses.""

Yuuji experiences first-hand the threat these Curses pose to society as he discovers his own newfound powers. Introduced to the Tokyo Metropolitan Jujutsu Technical High School, he begins to walk down a path from which he cannot return—the path of a Jujutsu sorcerer.

To the Top! Part 2). Of course everyone is praising this anime left and right. There are barely any negative reviews about this wherever I try to check, except for very few. To be very honest, I personally definitely am not the biggest fan of Jujutsu Kaisen.
                              [The following review was written right after episode 8 where I put the anime on-hold, but when episode 15 was out I picked it up again. See my UPDATED view down bellow]
                              *Contains minor spoilers*
                              Very good anime. The story is pretty interesting and leaves me wanting to watch. The art style is insane which I expected from the studio who did god of highschool. Seriously, the animation rivals mob psycho 100. This anime easily has the best OP and ED of the fall season too. The characters are likeable and I love Satorou and I also like how Yuuji and Kugisaki have funny moments together and aren't like sakura and naruto where sakura just punches him and stuff. Overall I give this a 10/10, good animation, good soundtrack, pretty good comedy, good job MAPPA          
                              This seems to be another of those run-of-the-mill power shonens. It has basically the same story as Chainsaw Man up till at least chap. 91 of that series manga, and i think Chainsaw Man will give us a much better experience. I don't expect the plot give us anything special tbh.
                              I rate shit on enjoyment because that is what's important. Shit's lit, so watch it if you like high quality action scenes with moments of light heartedness but with a general dark theme. Mixes really well in my opinion and I suggest highly. 
                              MC is very bad... Yuji's entire personality is based around a grandpa we knew for 1 episode with a screen time of less than a minute. and said like 7 words. yet his 7 words will dictate how the main character will act for possibly the rest of this series. very unfortunate that the author thinks we should care about someone that had less screen time than a no name curse. For the other characters, I see a lot of potential and hope they carry the load. Villains are mediocre at best except for one who's extensive backstory and connections to current characters is pretty          
                              Jujutsu Kaisen doesn't wanted to redeem the shounen genre with something new. Rather the ""better"" one or the complete enjoyment package which Jujutsu Kaisen are really made for. Or made of.
                              Jujutsu Kaisen is unlike any other anime I have seen before. When I first saw the trailer for it I thought that it was not really my style; seeming like a horror anime with obscure powers and weird monsters. Although Jujutsu Kaisen is this to a point it is so much more. As it does focus on the premise of curses, you can expect a horror aspect to this anime, which may not be your cup of tea, but trust me there is so much to offer in this anime. 
                              I'll give this review straight to the point! (10/10)
                              Pretty Neat
                              Ah yes, rating an anime even when only 1/4 of the whole series have dropped are we?
                              Its just an anime with bad/average story and no depth with masterful animation. 
                              Okay, i get the hype its pretty cool shonen and its been 8 episodes out now. But its add nothing new to the genre. You can see the series got influenced a LOT by other shonen anime. For example :
                              I'm not too far along in this series, but I can say that I am excited to see what this series brings. Jujutsu Kaisen is a refreshing take on Shonen anime, and it's didn't take long for me to get fully invested. If you like your battle Shonen, I feel you will like this anime. Jujutsu Kaisen is quirky and has a great story idea. I don't believe this anime ventures into a darker territory (at least from what I see), but it definitely dips its toes in it. It's as mature as any other Shonen anime.",85

A group calling themselves ""The Individual Eleven"" has begun committing acts of terror across Japan. While Motoko Kusanagi, Daisuke Aramaki, Batou, and the other members of Section 9 investigate this new menace, the Japanese government faces a separate crisis, as foreign refugees displaced by the Third World War seek asylum in Japan. But as the members of the special-ops team continually encounter Gouda Kazundo—a leading member of the Cabinet Intelligence Service—in their hunt, they begin to suspect that he may be involved, and that the events of the refugee crisis and The Individual Eleven may be more connected than they realize...

                              A couple years back I reviewed Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex, and it was fantastic with complex characters and compelling writing. It's one of the few things I've given a “10” rating. There's a sequel to the series, 2nd GIG, that came out not long after the first. So, will it be up to the same standard? Let's delve in and see.
                              It’s hard for me not to lavish praise upon the altar that is Ghost in the Shell, as I’ve always found the entire franchise to be among the pillars of great anime science fiction.  Each movie and show has delved deep into psychology, spirituality and even to some degree religion.  The question is how would Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex 2nd GIG stand up to the incredible first season and movies.  The answer is: it continued to raise that bar of excellence in this franchise.
                              The 2nd gig is a real disappointment compared to the first season of Ghost in the Shell.  There are two interconnected storylines (Gouda and the Cabinet of Intelligence; The Particularist Eleven) that run side by side and eventually are tied together.  It's an interesting storytelling approach but wasn't executed particularly well.  They should have taken a more conventional approach by having the storylines run more in parallel within each episode, and not have episodes dedicated mainly to one or the other.  I can't help but feel some coherence was sacrificed for this interesting innovation.  
                              After watching the fantastic first series of SAC I could not wait to get sunk into the 2nd Gig, however I was only met with disappointment. What made the first series so compelling and original was totally missing in 2nd Gig. 
                              Overall: This is actually one of my favorite anime series, when you watch it right after GitS:SAC, it flows pretty well. If you like a pretty deep sci-fi psychological action thriller, then GitS:SAC 2nd G will do well in pleasing you.
                              I love the complex story telling. Even though there are a lot of twists in the plot, in the ends it easily merges and effortlessly tells the story.
                              Continuing off from the first season, Ghost in the Shell 2nd GIG effectively makes itself into a political thriller series where what comes across at first sight as Section 9 trying to halt terrorist activity turns into an elaborate political conspiracy that once again pushes Section 9 to its limit in trying to halt. Much like the first season, 2nd GIG explores what appears to be a typical case for Section 9 to get involved in. But as they uncover more holes in facts being shown on the surface with said case, they become entangled in something much bigger than originally anticipated. In this case,          
                              Ghost in the Shell 2nd gig, second part of the Stand Alone Complex story-line of the Ghost in the shell franchise, is one of those anime which aren't usually talked about much, but of course, you might have heard about it but not too many discussions around. Now does it deserve more recognition or it just wasn't worth noting? Oh who am I kidding, I gave it a 9, of course it does, its not perfect though, but still close. 
                              The GIG is up! The 2nd GIG! 
                              In my previous review (on Eden of the East, please read it :D), I provided a long explanation and list of arguments that detail why director Kenji Kamiyama is a hack writer. I have nothing against the man on a personal level, I have never interacted with him, I currently have no reason to believe that he is not a kind person, and I have quite a bit of respect for his directorial style, but I do not find his writing very appreciable. So far, the only work of his that I thought was actually good was the first season of Stand Alone Complex (I          
                              (This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site)
                              2nd Gig is a continuation of Ghost in the Shell: Standalone Complex. They're so similar I'd rather just talk about their differences here. The atmosphere, execution, and characters are all the same. The only thing that changes is the story. The story in 2nd Gig is simply worse, which is weird. It feels just as epic and dense, but it's not. The music, the directing, the monologues, they're all there. But, the substance is missing. It feels like a Shell of its predecessor, missing its Ghost. I know I said earlier that the characters were the same, but that's the missing factor. The Laughing Man          
                              Masterpiece. Again. And just gotta love the last episode, like ep6 of Star Wars: when all the pieces of a brilliant 3D-puzzle fall into place. Quite overwhelming really, having to arrive to understand what everything's been about, even the details that made no sense earlier...but that's just like the first series, too. Same with how they close all the plotlines at the end, no open questions, no events left hanging in the air. Same with the complexity as well, woven together from many abstract layers, a feast for thought.
                              Stand Alone Complex was based on Yoshiki Sakurai’s 2001 Media Ecology dissertation “The Whereabouts of the Other in the Future of Human-Robot Interaction” (「他我を宿す条件 ～人間・ロボット間コミュニケーションの行方～」).",86

                              This is my first review; and what better series to review than the glorious Aria the Origination. 
                              Before watching Aria the Origination, you have to have watched the prequels - The Animation, The Natural and The OVA: Arietta - otherwise you will be doing yourself - but more importantly this series - a great disservice. Because Origination, being the grand finale of the franchise, demands that you as a viewer has formed bonds to the setting and characters of the Aria universe; if you haven't, you will automatically disarm the bomb of emotion that is this third and last season of Aria.
                              All things eventually have to come to an end, especially with series that have left a mark on many people. One series that has cemented itself as the king of accomplishing this for many is the Aria series. What many consider to be the series’s magnum opus, Aria the Origination is the last chapter in the anime adaptation of the beloved manga. As you might figure out, it is just about as glamoured with gorgeous music, cheerful characters, and melodramatic optimism as one can handle. Despite all of the beautiful aspects of this show, and the series as a whole, there’s still that one question          
                              The last voyage to Neo-Venezia? 
                              *This is my first review
                              The third season of Aria, Aria the Origination is a stunning and satisfying conclusion to the Aria story. With 2 seasons and a few OVAs behind it, I would say Aria the Origination has perfected the slice of life formula, hence its very well deserved high scores. I did analyze this alot, but at the end concluded that a review of this series would only be effective if it came from the heart :)
                              I had to mark down other anime's score because they couldn't come even close to Aria.
                              Aria the Origination is the marvelous conclusion of Akari, Alice, and Aika’s journey as undines in training while retaining all of the charm and glorious pace of its predecessors.
                              This is the final season of Aria, and what a bittersweet one it is. I’m so glad to have discovered this wonderful series, meeting characters and settings I won’t ever forget.
                              Aria the Origination has achieved something remarkable to which anyone who's familiar with the slice of live genre knows to be an extremely rare phenomenon; it manages to end satisfactory.    
                              ""Wonderful...""
                              Aria is a calm, cheerful series that seeks to find simple meaning in ordinary things. However, what meaning is found is usually of a trite nature, such as the love of one’s art being the most important thing in said art. Not only are such messages common and forgettable, but they even occasionally range close to the absurd. Several of the episodes don’t even have applicable morals, and these merely depict the characters enjoying their everyday lives and appreciating simple pleasures. The series seems more preoccupied with wondering at the workings of a nonexistent city than anything else.
                              [DISCLAIMER] As I want to get all my points across, as well as bring this show the justice it deserves, the following review is a lengthily-detailed breakdown of every factor ranging from the story to the overall experience. You may look for other reviews to find a more concise criticism of the show.

You’re probably invested in the characters, not to mention the buildup to the finale that has gradually been revealed through the last two arcs. 
                              Introduction:
                              This review of Gintama is about the whole series from 2006-2017 including the Slip Arc. It's my tribute for these years that I spent together with Gintama. Enjoy!
                              I'll keep it short because Porori-hen is for me like OVA for me rather than another season as it's between serious Gintama arcs, so I'll rate it subjectively.
                              For those of you wondering what this season is about, it's a season of comedy episodes that are adapted from manga chapters released before the content from episode 300 onwards. For those of you wondering if it's a nice break before the final arc of Gintama... not really.
                              Why am I even writing this review?  I'm two years late, and this is 330 episodes in. Does it even matter?  Of course it doesn't matter.  But, I'm addicted to leaving reviews so here is a pointless one for people who've already invested literally a decade of their lives getting this far into the series.
                              (This review applies to the entire Gintama series.)
                              The concept of time in the universe of Gintama is by far its most fascinating meta subject. For as much as the show likes to mock itself for its seemingly unchanging sitcom status quo, the fact is that Edo has never been frozen in time. The world has evolved with the show, with new characters, new relationships, old relationships developing and deepening, new playing fields of possibility being opened, and an increasingly changing understanding of the foundation fabric of the story itself., whether in massive game-changing arcs or the nuances of the ever-evolving sitcom antics themselves. Like its central character, Gintama is a show that          
                              Gintama has been going strong for a reasonable amount of time now and still proves to be the best of the best!
                              Its really amazing how Gintama doesn't care about randomly getting into slip arcs and still jokes about it, ""...stuff happened, and now we're here""
                              After focusing on the central plot, Gintama returns to its essence with the focus on comedy, parodies and presentation of new characters, except for the more dramatic tone of the Ikumatsu bow that had the closing of the development of this character.
                              As an show on its own, this season was decent. However, it somewhat falls short as a gintama season. It is not that this season was bad, but gintama has raised the bar so high that if it is a disappointment if it is anything less than amazing.
                              I am really big fan of Gintama I have watched every episode and I was really exited when new season started airing. ",88

                              THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS
                              Review In short, 
                              In my personal opinion, One Piece is one of those animes that is easy to love and is just as easy to hate. Funnily enough, those who love One Piece love it for exactly the same reasons that others hate it; the extreme characters, zany abilities, and classic artstyle all contribute to both sides. This review's goal is neither to covince you to love One Piece, nor is it the opposite. The review merely expresses my own personal views of the series.
                              Lets start with the story. 
                              One Piece recounts the story of Monkey D Luffy, a young man who wishes to become the Pirate King; and the rest of the crew of the Mugiwara ('Straw Hat') Pirate crew, each of whom join the crew to realise lifelong dreams of their own.
                              One Piece has been running for 15 years now and shows zero signs of slowing down. It is true that there are several anime and manga series that have run for MUCH longer, but that doesn't honestly excuse One Piece for how long it has overstayed it's welcome! One Piece has a diehard fandom and it is by far the highest in average rating out of the big 4 shonens. However, it is actually my LEAST favorite of the big 4. I'm dead serious, I really don't like One Piece and I will explain why.

                              I never write reviews but I think this series deserves it.
                              Ah, One Piece. The anime adaptation of the best selling manga in the world. I used to like this show when I first started watching it, but sadly I don't feel the same way about it anymore.",91

The first two seasons have gained a cult following since the franchise introduced us to the world of its karuta and wonderful cast of characters. Now more than six years later, we are back in this franchise as if it’s almost yesterday.

                              First things first - karuta isn't a sport. It's just a game that that some folks took way too seriously. Well, not like that has any impact on the anime, I just wanted to get this out of my chest. But it also means that you might enjoy this even if you don't like sport anime in general.
                              Chihayafuru is a manga series written and illustrated by Yuki Suetsugu; Chihayafuru is her first animated work, but not the first manga. The manga has been serialized in Be Love(Kodansha) since December 2007. Third season of the series aired in 2019, which is 6 years later after the second season. The manga, as well as the TV series, have won many awards; the manga also has more than 16 million copies in print.
                              After a seven year long break, Chihayafuru is finally back and it’s better than ever before. Fans, rejoice, because this is by far the best season of Chihayafuru and with some small exceptions this season has otherwise improved on every aspect compared to prior seasons. This review will outline the exact places where this series has improved, and why I believe this show deserves the highest rating of any sports anime around.
                              *Disclaimer*
                              This anime definitely is not for everyone. I don't know why is it rated so high, by so many people. I'll explain just 7 points why you can watch it and why you can't. 
                              ちはやふる 3  -  Chihayafuru 3 is an endearing sequel to the past seasons with the same distinctive charm and a lot of heart. It is a really beautiful series that appeals to a wide audience with excitement, fun and emotions and entertains them great. The third season, my third review of the series, and I still recommend the series as much as I did at the beginning.
                              Though we are parted,
                              Before starting Chihayafuru, I'm sure most people wondered how interesting a Japanese card game based Anime could be. Much to our delight, Chihayafuru 1 and 2 made us fall in love with Karuta and the Hyakunin Isshu, along with all the characters. While they both were pretty good Anime themselves, Chihayafuru 3 is better than the previous seasons by a huge margin, in every department - the Karuta, the romance, the character development, and the overall feel of Chihayafuru in general.
                              Chihayafuru the 1 and 2 season were great and fun but 3rd is more dark and sad. 
                              I write this review in a vain attempt to get even a single extra person to watch this. Even though this is a season 3 review, perhaps in some small way this tiny blip will contribute a fraction of a fraction of a percent to increasing its popularity. I truly believe this is one of those hallmark shows, one that every anime viewer should see.
                              i absolutely love the payoff for all the events of the previous two seasons. all of the things happen, all of the story development, all of the character developments.... it all goes down here

                              Once again, the 3rd season picks up exactly where the 2nd season left off. Most of the season takes place during the second half of the second year of Ayase and Mashima in their high school Karuta club, except for the last couple of episodes, which take place during the beginning of the third year.",93

When they meet, Joutarou realizes that he may have more in common with Jousuke than just a blood relation.

                              David Production was hardly a household name in the otaku community a few years ago. However everything changed when the fire nation attacked...I mean when they released their JoJo's Bizarre Adventure adaptation in 2012! While the budget was pretty low, David Production blew the community away with their attention to detail and loyalty to the source material and JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Part 4: Diamond is Unbreakable is no exception to this.
                              To anime and manga fans, Jojo is a classic that many may have heard of. Even if you’re not familiar with the franchise, you’ll bound to hear something related to Jojo somewhere whether it’d be a joke, meme, or reference. Diamond is Unbreakable chronicles the fourth expansion of the franchise and it’s among one of the most celebrated. As a personal favorite, Diamond is Unbreakable sets up for an adventure that is far more than bizarre.
                              JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken Part 4: Diamond wa Kudakenai, the 4th part of Hirohiko Araki's iconic manga series. After the most iconic manga series of all-time, stardust crusaders, what can you do? Well, you make the greatest bit of media to even scrape the heavens.
                              I'd like to preface this review by saying I totally understand why you might enjoy this show. Don't just look at this review, see its rating then click off. This review is a thorough dissection of Araki's Manga and DP's adaption of DiU. It's more of a fun than deep experience but I'm going to explain why DiU's critical flaws make the show very VERY difficult for me to enjoy. 
                              You though Stardust Crusaders would be the last of the JoJo adaptations, but it was me, Diamond is Unbreakable! Jokes aside, the adaptation of the next part is finally over after a 39-episode run. David Production has proven to be a very loyal studio when it comes to adaptations. For the last couple of years, David Production have been working on adapting the JoJo's Bizarre Adventure manga series written by Araki Hirohiko into an anime format. After doing an adaptation for the first three JoJo parts, David Production has adapted the fourth Part of the series, Diamond wa Kudakenai also known as Diamond is Unbreakable          
                              I have come to the conclusion the mangaka behind JoJo, after Phantom Blood and Battle Tendency, simply don't care about creating a world anymore and blinded fans simply take this series as it is the ultimate Shounen adventure.
                              Jojo: Diamond (PT 4).
                              Holy shit, this was a masterpiece.

                              JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken: Diamond wa Kudakenai Review
                              Jojo's Bizarre Adventure in general is an interesting show because I don't like it for a very specific reason. I dislike Jojo because I cannot ignore the fact people explain the plot or fight moves while standing by spectating. Yes, sometimes the show will poke fun at itself with Jojo saying ""Why are you just standing there"" (or something to that effect) but I just can't. It reminds me of shows where suddenly the hero gains some ridiculous power or strength because love, friendship, or intense emotional states. Bleh. 
                              The JoJo franchise is one I have some fondness for. It has an absurd naming scheme, over the top machismo & action, but I've still found it pretty endearing. I've talked about JoJo, Stardust Crusaders series 1 & 2. This time around, I'll be discussing Diamond is Unbreakable. Like the others, this is brought to us by David Production. It aired from April to December of 2016. I look forward to seeing a bunch of characters named after musicians & bands fighting in an absurdly over the top fashion. Let's get right to it.
                              DORARARARA!
                              Having been binging JoJo for the past few weeks, part 4 was the show I really wanted to write a review for. Until I saw it from myself I couldn’t believe that the growth in writing between seasons would be so significant. And with part 4, I feel like this is more apparent than ever. ",94

                              Story
                              End of Evangelion is truly a masterpiece of an anime movie. 
                              When a film starts with the main character giving himself a wank over an unconscious girl after he reveals her breasts by accident, you know you're in for a treat.

                              Do NOT watch this movie. It is the single most soul-crushingly depressing thing ever spawned from the depths of human imagination. It takes all of the closure, hopes, and expectations you had for the end of the series and blasts them into the sun. It is the single worst possible ending to anything EVER.
                              It's here, the one I really am not looking forward to. Yeah, I'm familiar with Neon Genesis Evangelion. I watched a good amount of it before deciding to just read the synopses for the remaining episodes to see if the characters ever stopped being unbearable only to immediately drop it when I learned that not only were the characters never going to improve but the plot was going to get really stupid really fast. To this day the popularity of the franchise baffles me. My best guess is that a lot of people can't tell the difference between depth and pretension so anything like Evangelion          
                              The ending to the popular Anime series, Neon Genesis Evangelion, left many questions as to the fate of NERV, the children, the Angels, and many other plot factors unanswered or otherwise hanging.

                              Overview:
                              End of Evangelion is a two-hour movie that consists of two hour-long episodes (Episodes 25 and 26) that was released on July 19th, 1997, has been licensed Stateside by Manga Entertainment, and was originally released over here on September 24th, 2002.  Episode 25 incorporates and expands upon footage from the Rebirth segment from the Death and Rebirth movie (released on March 15th of that same year), and is based off the original script for Episode 25.  It was produced by Production IG (famous for their work on the Ghost in the Shell series and xxxHOLIC) and Gainax (famous for their work on His          
                              After watching the final two episodes of the TV series, I couldn't help but feel a bit short-changed. Where was the action-packed finale I had hoped for? Most of all where was the result of the Human Instrumentality Project, it was all a bit too ambiguous and all played out within Shinji's mind - quite simply I didn't get it. Anno's attempt at a clever and deeply meaningful ending frankly falls short of its goal and leaves us frustrated (at least me anyhow).

With a group of samurai now incessantly harassing her, Fuu desperately calls upon another samurai in the shop, Mugen, who quickly defeats them with his wild fighting technique, utilizing movements reminiscent to that of breakdancing. Unfortunately, Mugen decides to pick a fight with the unwilling ronin Jin, who wields a more precise and traditional style of swordfighting, and the latter proves to be a formidable opponent. The only problem is, they end up destroying the entire shop as well as accidentally killing the local magistrate's son.

For their crime, the two samurai are captured and set to be executed. However, they are rescued by Fuu, who hires the duo as her bodyguards. Though she no longer has a place to return to, the former waitress wishes to find a certain samurai who smells of sunflowers and enlists the help of the now exonerated pair to do so. Despite initially disapproving of this idea, the two eventually agree to assist the girl in her quest; thus, the trio embark upon an adventure to find this mysterious warrior—that is, if Fuu can keep Mugen and Jin from killing each other.

Set in an alternate Edo Period of Japan, Samurai Champloo follows the journey of these three eccentric individuals in an epic quest full of action, comedy, and dynamic sword fighting, all set to the beat of a unique hip-hop infused soundtrack.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.5,8,105,87,901204,29714,"                              I caught Samurai Champloo as it aired back in 2004, and though I liked it enough, it didn’t impact me as much as I hoped it would. Though maybe that’s not entirely true, as the soundtrack did indirectly change my life, thanks to the composer Nujabes introducing me to instrumental hip hop and providing a soundtrack to my life for the next few years.
                                       Samurai Champloo is the latest work from Writer/Director Shinichiro Watanabe, who is most recognized for his work on Cowboy Bebop. One of the very few things Champloo and Bebop have in common is their great scores. Champloo mixes two subjects which would never be put in one sentence together, western hip-hop and eastern samurai swordplay. Yet the mixture comes out with a brilliant result. The fights scenes are hyped up with the speed and flow from the music and come out magnificent. But Champloo isn't all about fighting. Many things happen along the road for the          
                              Historical anime don't usually interest me, but when it's as tongue-in-cheek and as full of anachronisms as this, I'm not sure it really counts as a historical anime anymore.
                              For anyone who has watched Cowboy Bebop, they know that director Shinichiro Watanabe loves blending completely disparate elements together, be it science fiction, physical comedy, spaghetti Western, bebop jazz, or space epic, all into the same story.

                              The premise is simple, three complete strangers drawn together by fate to embark on a long, very parlous journey across unfamiliar territory. However, it's not the plot which makes Samurai Champloo note worthy, but rather the characters themselves. There is a very strong relate-ability present in the main characters Jin, Mugen and Fuu; no matter who the viewer happens to be it's a more than safe bet they will instantly find common ground with at least one if not all three. This element within it's self is the very one which drives the series forward, it offers added interest and added suspense as each of

                              Samurai Champloo is frequently compared to Cowboy Bebop, but there's one thing that really sets it apart: the action. There wasn't anything bad about Bebop's action, but Champloo's action is among the best of any anime out there, especially among TV series. Though the main characters both use swords, they fight with wildly different styles (Mugen's use of shoes is particularly brilliant), and the fights against enemies with various weapons throughout the series all manage to make themselves interesting and different. Even if the rest of the series were terrible, it would be worth watching simply for the action.

                              This show could have been something special on the same page as such classics like Ninja Scroll(NOT THE TV SERIES), Samurai X OVAs, Rurouni Kenshin, or Basilisk.
                              Fuu is a young orphaned girl doing her best to survive while working in a teashop. But her world as she knows it begins to unravel the minute a wandering Okinawan swordsman by the name of Mugen slouches into the shop while the daikon's abusive son and his rude cronies are also having some fun. When Fuu becomes the victim of their nasty games, she immediately offers Mugen fifty dango if he saves her from them. At the same time, a masterless samurai named Jin bears witness to the daikon's cruelty and quickly intervenes, easily dispatching the daikon's &quot;best of the best&quot; guards.

                              Let me say this from the start that I like the opening and ending of this movie so much. Studio Shaft has done a phenomenal job once again , specially now because it was theatrical release, our man Akiyuki Shinbo has done a great job, I will say even that overall its an improvement on the previous seasons. I liked those numbers that showed that how many cuts have been shown from the movie but this time the cuts were reversed because that right Araragi was in the mirror world (by the way this not a spoiler, its right there in the description). It was          
                              Perplexing has been the word to describe the world of the Monogatari series, and perplexing is how this final story of the series is gonna be.
                              So the only part I actually enjoyed where the last 5-10 minutes with Senjougahara. The problem is that:
                              I was more than happy with the ending of Owarimonogatari, so why continue the ending?  I feel as though it wrapped Araragi's story near perfectly and is the clear endpoint for his character. Well, it's Monogatari, so the answer is always fanservice. 
                              Realizing the fact that the main story has ended feels really weird because i didnt feel fulfilled (in the first place).
                              The Monogatari Series is a wild ride that I recommend to anyone who is looking for a series to really get invested in. It is full of deep character development and  fantastic dialogue that makes you really attached to each an every character and their stories and problems. Sure, the series has its slow points, but it always seems to pull me back in when I am starting to feel bored. Each character has an extremely unique story to tell, making them all enjoyable characters to watch. Throughout the story Araragi goes through a massive amount of problems and issues that he must solve,

The plot is outstanding and it doesn't get tiring at all. Although it is a bit confusing at first it's not hard to understand and follow it. All the characters are very well drawn and portrayed. The animation is beautiful too, their movements are so smooth and it's almost hypnotizing to watch. The voice actors have done an amazing work showing the characters feelings (especially in the last episode). The music is truly magnificent as well. I really liked the fact that          
                              Hi, I'll make it short for you guys, put some headphones, and dive into it, the music, art and plot will do the rest.
                              This review won't go too much in depth with the points presented because I am trying to forget I ever watched this show. Seeing how there are no critical opinions available like anywhere on the interwebs, I thought I should do at least this much.
                              Where do I begin with? I was doing a search on pinterest for some traditional media pictures and some fanart of chinese illustrations and some pictures with long haired guys that looked like anime images would pop up again and again. So I finally decided to do a reverse image search. And I can't believe what a gold mine I stumbled across!! 
                              I was amazed to my ""Golden Core"" ! [SPOILER-FREE]
                              I cannot imagine going back to Japanese anime after this show. It has obliterated all current standards. The worldbuilding, storytelling, music, ART, plot....everything has surpassed my expectations. 
                              Now, I have never written any reviews on any anime whatsoever. However, Mo Dao Zu Shi has me sister stoked in such a good way that I cannot hold myself back from writing a review on this masterpiece.
                              so i watched this chinese ONA because one of my friends recommended it :D
                              The art is realistic but not to a point where it's annoying or far-fetched. The story is extraordinary with its tearful moments that brings jabs to the heart and overjoyed moments that make you want to jump off your seat. Mo Dao Zu Shi contains plenty action, some BL, comedy, drama, and heart-felt scenes that brought myself to tears. The sound is even greater than any anime i've ever watched in the past years with its exquisite music. Not just the music, the sound effects as well. The characters were my favorite of course due to the development of Wei Wuxian's character and the relationship          
                              I personally really enjoyed this show. The art was amazing the soundtrack was amazing and not only that but the story telling was extremely well done. Although most people will tend to avoid this show because it contains BL. I really think that people who usually avoid BL, can actually watch this because the story is so amazing and you can somewhat ignore the aspect of it being BL and pass it more as bromance. So whether you are into BL or not I think this donghua was very well made and I really enjoyed it(literally got me obsessed lol).           
                              Mo Dao Zu Shi is absolutely awesome! The story is very interesting with amazing plot structures. The setting of fiction ancient China creates a tons of charming experiences to the audience. 
                              Im going to start off by saying, this is the first review i've ever written, you'll surely find grammar mistakes along the way and maybe silly reasonings, but bear with me!
                              Long ago, the cultivation clans lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when the Wen clan attacked. Only the Yiling Patriarch, master of harnessing negative energy, could stop them. But when the world needed him most, he went kinda batshit crazy, killed a bunch of his friends and exploded. Now, my brother and I have found the new Grandmaster of Demonic Cultivation, a lunatic named Mo Xuanyu. And while his fluting skills are great, he's got a long way to go before he's ready to save anyone.
                              Boy oh boy oh boy
                              I can't decide if  I like or hate this anime. The plot is intriguing/interesting and so is the world, there is also some gay or hinted at gay I think?(which is always nice).",100
102,"Eighth-grader Shigeo ""Mob"" Kageyama has tapped into his inner wellspring of psychic prowess at a young age. But the power quickly proves to be a liability when he realizes the potential danger in his skills. Choosing to suppress his power, Mob's only present use for his ability is to impress his longtime crush, Tsubomi, who soon grows bored of the same tricks.

In order to effectuate control on his skills, Mob enlists himself under the wing of Arataka Reigen, a con artist claiming to be a psychic, who exploits Mob's powers for pocket change. Now, exorcising evil spirits on command has become a part of Mob's daily, monotonous life. However, the psychic energy he exerts is barely the tip of the iceberg; if his vast potential and unrestrained emotions run berserk, a cataclysmic event that would render him completely unrecognizable will be triggered. The progression toward Mob's explosion is rising and attempting to stop it is futile.

                              Have you ever watched an anime that had 12 episodes that had very interesting visuals, great characters (and development) and story that was charming in its own nature? No? Well Mob Psycho 100 is right here for you to watch! 
                              Funny, whimsical, charming, and oddly enough, thoughtful. 
                              Last year, One Punch Man rose to popularity and became of the most mainstream and popular anime of the current decade. However, the mangaka of One Punch Man also had another really good series that not many have heard about, Mob Psycho 100. With an adaptation for ONE’s other series, Mob Psycho 100 was also able to generate a good amount of popularity, due to it living off of One Punch Man’s brand. Though there might be some similarities between the two series, Mob Psycho 100 is quite different One Punch Man in a lot of ways. And it manages to create its own name,          
                              (spoiler-free review)
                              Hype has always been a double-edged sword, Mob Psycho 100 (I’ll use the abbreviation MP100 for the following) and One Punch Man (OPM) being an almost perfect example of that exact statement. MP100 never got that much attention since it started airing in the Summer Season 2016, being outclassed in popularity by shows like Orange, Shokugeki no Souma S2 and the ongoing Re:Zero in that respect, at least at the start of Summer season. It was never hyped as ‘the best thing evar’, nor did it receive much negative backlash because of that. Unlike MP100’s relative lack of popularity, the author's other work One Punch          
                                When I went into Mob Psycho 100, the only thing I tried to expect was that I'd be watching a good comedy series paired with good action. We all know that One is a competent writer, but I decided that comparing this series' quality to One Punch Man would most likely be unfair. Little did I realize that this series would not only match the quality of One Punch Man, but add the things I felt were missing in it. Now even though I didn't want to compare this series to One Punch Man, I'll be doing a fair bit of that in          
                              Living by the shadow of One Punch Man, Mob Psycho 100 is probably the best anime that aired this season.  People are always complaining about how anime is always the same: boys that can travel back in time, tsundere protagonists or MMORPG worlds.
                              Mob Psycho 100 is based off of a manga by ONE. Yes, the same manga artist behind One Punch Man. The anime came out last year and was brought to us by Bones. Yes, the Soul Eater, Heroman, Wolf's Rain, etc... Studio. So, is this one okay like One Punch Man, better or worse? 
                              Mob Psycho 100 was LA's favourite anime of Summer 2016 and really it pulled it off, bringing in a two for two for ONE, the creator of One Punch Man, so what made Mob Psycho 100 another great like One Punch Man?, well it's a bit complicated to say the least...let's find out.
                              Wow... trying to come up with a compelling first sentence sure is hard... I'll just take a moment to myself before I start.
                              First thing is first, don't compare this to One Punch Man, in my opinion the first 2-3 episodes is kinda like a bad copy of OPM truth be told, but afterwards you see what Mob Psycho is all about and that is where you start to love it. 
                              This show is an absolute treat. As many already know, Mob Psycho 100, based on the web manga by ONE, shares many aspects with his One Punch Man series and the subsequent adaptation. However, while OPM is immensely entertaining due to the overwhelming strength of its protagonist, Mob Psycho 100 takes a more refined look at its characters and produces a show that not only reaches but surpasses the heights of its sister series.
                              For the people that expect another OPM from this. Don't get your hopes up. This is totally different.

103,"Nichijou primarily focuses on the daily antics of a trio of childhood friends—high school girls Mio Naganohara, Yuuko Aioi and Mai Minakami—whose stories soon intertwine with the young genius Hakase Shinonome, her robot caretaker Nano, and their talking cat Sakamoto. With every passing day, the lives of these six, as well as of the many people around them, experience both the calms of normal life and the insanity of the absurd. Walking to school, being bitten by a talking crow, spending time with friends, and watching the principal suplex a deer: they are all in a day's work in the extraordinary everyday lives of those in Nichijou. 

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.48,8,111,153,651311,18480,"                              Overview:
                              If I had to sum up all of Nichijou in one word, it would be ""beautiful."" As a slice of life, this anime can't be for everyone, as most people like to have a story that is actually driven by the plot. But even if you aren't into slice of life anime, there is something in Nichijou for everyone to enjoy.
                              Nichijou is to me, one of a kind. It emphasizes what seems to be the essence of slapstick comedy, but induces your favorite lighthearted scenario all within the same episode. If you were keen of Lucky Star, Azumanga Daioh, Hidamari Sketch, or Pani Poni Dash, then you would definitely know what I'm talking about. Except, Nichijou, or ""EveryDay"", takes a twist and turn every now and then to let you know this is not so ordinary, and from there, you're on a wonderful ride to a pure fun and blownout comedy. 
                              Great animation won't save this slice of life comedy from absolute failure.
                              Nichijou is a perfect example of a show that tries too hard to ride off the success of other shows. It's not that anything it does is bad, it's just that other shows do what Nichijou does much better.
                              How does one describe ordinary. Any dictionary will probably describe ordinary as ""Something that is commonly encountered, usual"" or something to that effect. So how does a show like Nichijou (which roughly translates to Regular Life) get a title like... well Nichijou. A show with robots, wigs, deer, and all manner of unusal things is anything but... ordinary right? Perhaps they titled it like this as a bit of a joke, to bounce off all the crazy stuff that is to come. But I think there is a little bit more behind the title than first meets the eye. Lets find out shall we?
                              Before I start with this review, I want to say: this is my first review. Maybe it'll be short for some of you people and probably, the only one I'm going to write. So please bear with me and with my lack of experience when it comes to review things. If there's something you'd like to tell me about the review itself or how wrong I am for not liking such “funny and original piece of art”, then you're free to do it, leaving the comments in my profile.

                              New generation anime sitcom has arrived…
                              ""A beautiful disaster-piece"" is what I use to describe Nichijou. While watching, I couldn't help but find myself to be so engaged, eyes literally almost glued to my screen. That's how great it was. There are many things I loved about Nichijou which makes it one of my personally favorites.. 
                              When your entire show relies on gag comedy, and the majority of that gag comedy relies on subverting expectations, and most of those subverted expectations end with something random rather than clever, you've taken comedy and beat it down to its worst form.  The lolrandom form, which is the form that Nichijou loves best.  It's a sketch show, and all sketch shows are bound to be hit-or-miss.  Nichijou is just a lot of misses with maybe a hit or two sprinkled in every five episodes.  Maybe it's just my sense of humor, but a lot of the humor relies too heavily          
                              Nichijou is a comedic manga/anime/PSP game written by Keiichi Arawi. It's had very limited releases outside of Japan with the North American versions even being canceled for reasons I don't know. The question is, were audiences thankfully spared or are they missing out on something? I'm going to examine the anime to find out.
                              Nichijou means ""Everyday Normal (Life)"", and this anime is nothing close to that.
                              Being a KyoAni project, the first thought that came into my mind when I saw the cover art for Nichijou was that it is going to be a comedy/slice of life filled with cute girls doing cute things. Luckily, there's much more to this anime. Nichijou is a sketch comedy, with a sprinkle of slice of life, set in a junior high school. While the title in English is ""My Ordinary Life"", Nichijou is full of the extraordinary.

                              You can say I have bad taste in anime or that I'm simply following another persons preference. To be honest, I really don't care. This movie was great and that's all I have to say. 
                              This is a movie, which means it can only holds one plot. And that's may disappoints some people, but the hardcore Otaku fans will enjoy this regardless the fact the main subject isn't about comicet. 
                              This is the best as I really expected, because the TV series is also very guaranteed

                              First I want to say a big thank you to the producers, development studio, and narrators who created this story, Saekano Movie. I was very happily surprised and my feeling somehow felt that this was a masterpiece that I had been waiting for, yeah, maybe about 3 to 4 years I waited until Saekano Fine finally aired on the screen or maybe your favorite cinema.
                              SHORT SUMMARY: MAINSTREAM, CRINGEY, ANKWARD BUT I LOVE IT. 
                              for the animation, it's so cool. I think the opening was used motion graphic or 3d movement that the first time i see that thing in anime. I love the sound design, left and right is very pronounced. 
                              I absolutely despised every single minute of this film.
                              First of all: my main language isn't english, so be kind to me.

                              And that's it, the end of a journey that lasted 7+ years is finally here and as a lot of anime end, it ended in a disappointment. 
                              I will preface this by saying that I'm not a fan of dramas but I do find one occasionally that is written so well that I actually enjoy it, so take that how you will.
                              To me Oregairu has always been the Rick and Morty of anime. It's pretentious, it's pseudo deep, it wants to be so intelligent and clever yet fails to do so. For the life of me I have tried to understand what people see in this series besides waifus and I really can't. Oregairu Kan offers no real change in that regard, other than more Yui, which for me is the only reason I didn't give this a 1/10. 
                              Now that the journey for the genuine article has ended, the progress from the previous season was severed. For the plot have went off the rails, and devolved to it's weaknesses, dragged to death, the substance has abandoned ship. For what value has left? When it's was already spent. What words could have been said, was tainted, it's pretentious already. A social commentary, as everyone perceived, but rarely seen for what it really is, a mirror hidden in plain sight, a work of self reflection for it's own audience. It should have ended earlier already, nothing else is left to said, the melodrama has made          
                              This review covers the entirety of oregairu series (this means that there may be spoilers for those unfamiliar with the series)	

                              Oregairu finishing its final season was certainly something else. Brain’s Base and feel. both did a phenomenal job when it came to adapting their seasons, and I hope that most of the people reading this can agree with that. While I haven’t been with the Service Club for their 7-year animated run, the 5 years wait between the two feel. seasons was certainly worth it in the end. Well, for the most part.
                              A rather disappointing season which didn't live up to its predecessors. Climax is no climax, and is lacking and left me unsatisfied.
                              All good things must come to an end and here we are, the final season of My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU Climax. You know that feeling when you finally move away from your closest friend since childhood? That’s the kind of feeling I got after this final season concluded.
                              Well I finally finished watching Oregairu today and i gotta say... I HATED IT!!! 
                              As someone who had their fair share of drama and romance during my high school days, I’ll provide my two cents on this finale season. 
                              TLDR: A very poor buildup to what is a generally good ending to an outstanding anime series. Sprinkled with some emotional moments supported by the amazing production done by Studio feel. I will miss this series for the experience for the foreseeable future.
                              Look I am going to keep this short and simple. This season, didn't live upto my expectations, that doesn't mean its a bad anime. I still consider the season 1 and 2 are far superior and interesting. Season 1 has the car accident issue, season 2 has predominant Hachiman way of solving things and moreover season 2 made me cry at a point but season 3 has no major story (which is even worse since it is very predictable) to keep me interested and I didn't even feel anything from the characters.

                              Banana Fish is a 2018 anime based off of a manga that ran from the mid 80s to mid 90s. The original manga was written by Yoshida Akimi. Who I am not even slightly familiar with. The anime version was handled by MAPPA. The same studio behind rubbish like Kakegurui and Sakamichi no Apollon. But they also worked on Dororo. So, we have to give them some credit. 
                              I haven’t cried actual tears over fictional characters in a while but damn. I’m a mess.
                              I stumbled upon this anime not expecting what I was about to watch. Truthfully, it does not appeal very much to the majority of the audience. I also had a hard time getting hooked in the first episode since the complexity was too much for me- but, that's just what makes this a good anime. The foundation is very organized, stories connect well, different factors add up and it balances everything.

                              This is not your basic, instant satisfaction, mainstream anime. Looking for fanservice? Fast paced episode stories? Your modern formulaic anime? No? Then this isn't the place to be.",112

Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure Stardust Crusaders: Second Season (or Egypt Arc) provokes the question of what the audience wants to see next. The first half of the adaptation already showed plenty of Stands ranging from one that can attack via reflective surfaces, a parasitic being that can enter a victim’s brain, or even a Stand that can attack in dreams with Freddy Krueger style. The answer is simple really. It continuously deliver a source of imaginative and entertainment that almost anyone will find entrancing.
                              When you're in the world of anime and manga, there are these popular and trending materials that are too long and big to take up and follow. No matter how hard you try to ignore these trends, they keep popping up, and it almost feels like it is impossible to stay up to date in the anime world without watching/reading them. At least for me, not staying up to date is like being dead in this world of anime.

                              The second season of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders is the when all the real stuff of the 3rd part of JoJo manga happens. 
                              The JoJo series is a very peculiar beast, one ridden with overly muscular super humans, flamboyantly stunning poses, and over-the-top battles that are sure to fill your battle shounen needs. All of these elements are turned up to 11 for Part 3, also known as Stardust Crusaders. While the first season of Stardust Crusaders helped get the ball rolling, the second season had me fully invested, excitedly awaiting my dose of weekly JoJo tomfoolery and badassery.
                              Jojo Bizarre Adventure Part 3: Second Season is pretty much the same thing that you experienced in the first season, however unlike the first season where practically every episode the group had a new enemy to fight, on this season they basically put 2 episodes for each new enemy, which makes the pace of the episodes much better than the first season.

                              ***SPOILER WARNING***
                              The 2D animation is mediocre. The 3D animation is awful.
                              This is one of the most awesome anime ever created. 
                              Now I'm going to let you know in advance that Stardust Crusaders is my favorite manga of all time. So I'm a little biased toward it and it's anime adaptation but I am going to write a review to the best of my abilities taking this into consideration.
                              The story
                              TL;DR: The second season to Stardust Crusaders fails to keep one interested as the creativity of the end of Part 3 plummets, and makes the viewer both lethargic and bored. I would physically only recommend this season to people who desire to finish up Stardust Crusaders, but one could skip to the last 6 episodes to save the trouble of wasting a great deal of time. 
                              Another part/season of Jojo completed and added to the books! Let's get right into the anime basics.
                              Jojo's bizarre adventure stardust crusaders climactic finale, we went to Hong Kong, Singapore, India, Pakistan, Arabia, crossed the Red Sea and finally made it to the place were we wanted to go from the start of our journey, Egypt. The second season to part 3 stardust crusaders is the most satisfying conclusion to any Jojo part and many shonen series out there, we continue following our fellow crusaders across the Nile and finally arrive at Cairo in Egypt, stardust crusaders 2nd season is one of the best jojo parts around and is a greatly satisfying conclusion to the Brando and Joestar rivalry, but does it          ",113

Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru (also known as Run With the Wind) is an actual book adaptation and features competitive running as part of its plot. Like most competitive sports, the show delivers storytelling to feature the journey of characters to accomplish their goals. Thankfully, this show delivers a promise that won’t leave you disappointed.
                              Anyone who has ever run knows that it sucks. Why waterboarding is a thing when treadmills exist is a complete mystery to me. I guess even the KGB had its limit on how fucked up their torture methods were. Anyhoo, Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru --  Run with the Wind -- is a story about people who are literally the epitome of masochism and, as weird as it may sound, actually enjoy running. I was expecting a psychological series going in depth with this pain = pleasure thing, but turns out our series relies on fujobaiting instead.
                              This show is underrated and a true gem.
                              We, humans, are always an interesting bunch of creatures. The difference between us humans from animals is that we have dreams. Dreams we set as our goals with. We chase down our dreams in the road of life, hoping to reach self-satisfaction and eternal happiness. Sadly, not everybody has a solid resolve to chase down their dreams, while some don’t have an end goal in their life, making the destination of life confusing and frustrating. But even with those odds, we still continue to move and keep on running in different directions. We still chase down the unknown answer we seek. This is what Kaze          
                              There are various aspects which have to be considered and come into play if we are talking about how a good anime should generally be like. That said, values and priorities in regards to a story and technical features may differ dependent on whom you ask. Well thought out plot, compelling characters or perhaps a focus on visual storytelling-you name it, all of us have preferences whose omnipresence ultimatively dictates our viewing habits and the enjoyment we receive out of something. There's still one attribute I view  as vital in order to appeal to the audience, namely heart and even more so when it          
                              Do you like running? So let's run together!

                              ""Haiji... this isn’t just your dream anymore... it’s our dream. 
                              I never really enjoyed any sports anime ever before watching this anime. The reason I never liked any sports show was simple, you see all any sports anime ever did was just putting so much effort on the sports itself that they forget to develop the characters who are the essential part of the anime(looking at Haikyuu, yuri on ice and free).
                              *Insert Stupid Quote"" Reviews nowadays are either filled with people having unpopular opinions and people liking them a lot, or some guy who writes an entire essay on why the show is a ""masterpiece."" Personally, I try and watch for enjoyment instead of picking apart every little thing within an anime. Anime, in my opinion should be watched with enjoyment rather than be slammed down by little tiny flaws that lowers the overall ""score.""
                              I'm not gonna lie to you guys okay? The ending was a bit rushed. Like, they could've pumped it to 25 episodes instead of 23. But maybe I'm only saying that because THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST ANIME I'VE EVER SEEN, AND I WANT MORE OF IT.
                              I don't like running,
                              Truly a masterpiece!
                              I've heard some positive murmurs about this anime and, after re-watching 'Haikyuu!!' for the tenth time, I decided to check out another Production I.G. anime. Maybe it wasn't such a great idea to watch a new sports anime right after watching one of my all time favorites, but my opinion would probably remain the same regardless: it was underwhelming. 
                              Running with the Wind will convince you that Japanese animation is indeed an artform, and is able to deliver unique experiences that could not have been replicated in any other artform. The writing is phenomenal, and is beautifully told with the help of choreography, cinematography, great voice acting and beautiful art.",114

It’s a subject matter that fully intrigues and it's not hard to deduce why: it parallels heavily with our own society. The unwavering quench to advance collective technologies and the relative dependency on machines has drastically grown with the ages. Authors, artists, social critics, and scholars from all walks of life have adopted this framework and produced some of the most imaginative works that not only entertain, but step beyond the fictional realm to perhaps foreshadow a similar tomorrow not too far away…
                              Science Fiction has come a long way from stories involving the unknown reaches of space by the works of Jules Verne and H.G. Wells to stories that draw social implications of our society from famed authors George Orwell and Phillip K. Dick. There is little doubt that anime productions have tackled a lot beneath the limits of the genre ranging from Space Opera to Cyberpunk. One series that is often considered one of the most popular in the anime Sci-fi genre is Ghost in the Shell. After the success of the movie, directed by celebrated director Mamoru Oshii, we now have Ghost in the Shell:          
                              The 'Ghost in the Shell' movie was already a ground-breaking anime, inspiring such works as 'The Matrix' and 'Animatrix'; the TV series just takes it one step further.  
                              I haven't written any reviews for any anime so this may be a bit rocky. -.-
                              My view of anime, broadly speaking, might be called hopeless. I don't expect great things from the medium, and I am rarely given any reason to. Despite the insistence of the Anime News Network types, I don't think anime is particularly exceptional in the scope of its content, thematically or otherwise, and so the notion that these abstract forces (""moe,"" ""loli,"" ""otaku pandering,"" etc.) could ruin the entire medium borders on the absurd. Much of anime is very much genre fiction, and replacing one set of generic conventions and tropes with another is progress, if anything. With that said, I have no problem with good          
                              Previous to watching this, I had seen the famous Ghost in the Shell film from the 90s, as well as its sequel, several times. Not because I liked them though. Rather, due to my lack of willingness to accept that I truly did not like a lauded combination of philosophy, anime and cyberpunk; three things which I'm very fond of. It didn't make any sense. Despite some interesting, and obviously influential visuals, as well as some nice actions scenes, it seemed to me too much like the worst of European art films. It was unnecessarily slowly paced, and constantly making meaningless references to literature and          
                              The first season of Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex is absolutely brilliant.  For those who are not familiar with this series, it's a spinoff of the 1995 movie Ghost in the Shell, which has influenced many directors, not least of which are the Wachowski brothers who later created The Matrix.
                              There are several things I don't appreciate in Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex.
                              There is an abundance of American procedural cop shows nowadays in which most basically develop, or proceed, in the same manner with no real change either structural-wise or its characters, which may leave some viewers with no real impact. Then there is Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, which manages to create a much more intriguing story by having its setting in a cyberpunk future where complete mechanization of the human body has become a reality, and associated with it, crimes. Furthermore, world building is done magnificently through the numerous stand alone episodes. However, as I am no fan of this type of show,          
                              I've talked about Ghost in the Shell before. Both the first and second films. Now, it's time to look at the television installments, or at least one of them. Stand Alone Complex ran for a full year, from October 2002 to October 2003. So, it was released after the first film but before the second. Like the films, it was handled by Production I.G. It was written and directed by Kamiyama Kenji, who was not involved with either the first film or Innocence. What's his take on the material? Let's take a look and find out.
                              Everyone has their choice which are to be respected but to critique or review means to consider from an unbiased and logical point of view. Thus, due to my affiliation with the original movies and the characters, I would give it a 10  but if considered technically, there are things to be mentioned. Slight as they are, they will be mentioned. This review contains some spoilers.
                              Being myself a fan of this masterpiece made by Shirow Masamune, I can't find the words to tell you how much I enjoyed watching this wonderful series.
                              I once read that war is supposedly the most efficient way of pushing technology on a higher level. This doesn't seem to be too untrue in the universe of Ghost in the Shell since it already has four world wars in total behind itself - one being a nuclear one; hence the technology within itself has sky-rocketed to incredible dimensions.

I wondered if we had even seen the same movie. I, and seemly many who left the theatre did not leave angry; but we certainly were not raving about it being a masterpiece either. And in the whole theatre, only a single person cried. I overheard many conversations after the movie of it being ""okay"" and ""a lot of stuff didn't make sense"" and a few more criticisms. And I agree with them, this movie is no masterpiece. However, it is not bad either. So, here is my review
                              I saw this movie already few weeks ago, but I am posting my review for it delayed because for the first time in several years, I was lost in what to say.
                              To start, I watched this in theaters in Japan.
                              [Spoiler Warning]
                              I haven’t watched anime in over a year and I wanted to revisit its form through a good entry point. There was a lot of social media buzz surrounding this movie. People on this site were giving it 9’s and 10’s and even one of my favorite musicians, Porter Robinson, tweeted about this movie and how good it was. And so, I selected this movie on a cozy Friday night with a bowl of soup and high expectations. 
                              This is the single-handed, worst anime movie I've ever watched. It would've done a whole lot better as a 12 episode anime vs. a 2 hour movie. 3? 4? Time skips? In two hours? I don't even think One Piece has had that many time skips and it's at 900+ episodes.
                              This will be a very in-depth review.

                                Maybe I  wrote for you obviously thing - but crisis of ideas was come. 
                              [Warming Spoilers]
                              I'll keep this short -- this movie was a huge let-down. The first quarter/half or so was at least fairly interesting and quickly took a downturn in the second act. If you want, you can stop reading here. 
                              Back when the first trailers dropped, I was pumped to watch this movie. The artwork looked so stunning, the premise felt original and full of potential. After waiting for half a year until it finally became available to watch, I have to say it didn’t live up to my hopes.
                              It's world building is done very well and very naturally and feels so legit and lived in. It's done in a way that's very show and don't tell which makes it so easy to fall into. It's a light fantasy setting, which is neat since you don't see that in anime very often. The CG is sparse but does kind of stand out, but still isn't the worst I've seen. There's some very nice animation on display here at times. The premise and some of the ideas I think that hey were going for are interesting, but the way it's presented is disjointed and some          
                              Maquia is a disappointment. If you enjoyed the movie, by all means go ahead and enjoy it - but to me it lacks the space to really drive its narrative and themes home, and as a result characters who should be interesting and compelling come off one dimensional and occasionally annoying as the thematic resolution falls flat. First things foremost, though: I have absolutely nothing against Mari Okada or her work on this project. She has her fair share of haters and her style is not always my thing, but she does a fantastic job with what she is given on this project. Thanks to          
                              this story is about the real meaning of the ""hebeol"" its the connector between the humans and its more than love it self if i see amazing thing in this movie its how he show the feelings between humans , in every death we know how they feel and after watching this movie it's feel like being reborn in another life with clear soul and lets start :)   ",117

That peace, however, was shattered when the Colossus Titan and Armored Titan appeared and destroyed the outermost wall, Wall Maria. Forced to retreat behind Wall Rose, humanity waited with bated breath for the Titans to reappear and destroy their safe haven once more.

Shows that are so addicting that you just can’t seem to stop watching them. Shows that combine many pivotal elements of storytelling together to create something that is genuinely incredibly well produced. Anime that make you wholeheartedly pleased to have become a part of the anime community.
                              Attack on Titan's first season never really sat right with me. A series more interested in cinematics (orchestrals, screaming aplenty) than it did in conveying a message or allowing its audience to care for the characters beyond whatever grisly death they inevitably succumb to. It was loud, its presence ever more so, and so I distanced myself from what seemed standard action movie cuisine.
                              Attack on titan needs no further introductions, we all know about it… there are some people who put it on a pedestal, and there are some people who denigrate it. I choose to be honest and interpret the facts as fairly as I possibly can, and not write a verbose review.
                              Season 2 has come and gone and this three month was really enjoyable, but do not fear, season 3 is already announced for 2018! Now on to the review.
                              Another fantastic anime finished and now we wait for the next season which was confirmed will be in 2018. Yet again, I'm writing this review as an au courant with the manga. I'll try my best to not include spoilers. Hahaha. Anyhoo, here I go. Please bear with me. 
                              Anticipation.
                              Do you not know? Have you not heard? The LORD is the everlasting God, the creator of the ends of the Earth. He will not grow tired or weary, and his understanding no one can fathom. He gives strength to the weary and increases the power of the weak. Even youths grow tired and weary, and young men stumble and fall; but those who hope in the LORD will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint.
                              TL;DR: Does it really matter what I write? You have waited 4 years, endured 2 trashy live action movies and restrained yourself from reading the manga to find out what's in Erin's basement. So go watch the anime to find that answer! But knowing you, you will stick around and read this review. So in short, Game of Thrones meets Inception/Memento and has a forbidden love-child they didn't reveal to the world because they were scared it will not live up to hype and success of their first child. 
                              The sequel to Attack on Titan or Shingeki no Kyoujin was probably the most awaited anime series of the decade. I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say that because the first season just made a stupendous impact on the anime industry. Fans waited, and waited, and waited, for a second season to come and after four long years(God knows what the studio was doing for this long), we finally got a second season to one of our favorite, or for some people, one of their most hated anime. 
                              Updated version of my previous top review:
                              Attack on Titan has an unfortunate truth surrounding it. Critics and fanboys surmise their opinions, incessantly hurling them at each other in hopes of smothering people into submission. One thing not present enough with this anime is a middle ground. In Season 2 we saw a surprising 12 episodes, a missing producer and a far different plot direction. The question is, did these things work for or against the franchise, and is it still the same old AoT that millions of viewers addictively engulfed several years ago? I feel it’s time to address the elephant in the room and provide a brutally honest review of          
                              TLDR Second Season wasn’t as good as the first. It was slow paced, didn’t have nearly as much action, and focused mainly on character development. The opening song goes back to the show’s origins by having a opening track that sound incredibly similar to the first theme. Probably one of this season’s biggest drawbacks is that all of season two basically happened in a single romeo-juliet-styled week (all of Romeo and Juliet took place in about one week). Because of the slowness, it wasn’t nearly as exciting as season one which showcased the mysterious nature of walls getting kicked down by abnormal titans and other

                              [5.0/10]
                              By seeing the rating I’ve gave this show with such praise beyond the anime community, I’m sure many must think I’m just another “mainstream anime hater”. I assure you that I have a good reason for giving this show the rating of 3.",118

120,"Pokémon-themed music video for the song ""Acacia"" by BUMP OF CHICKEN.",8.44,8,132,4218,14655,154,"                              This music video is a perfect illustration of why I love anime. 
                              I watched it about eleven times since it released. Every time i cried from nostalgia. Greatly captures feelings of bond created with characters across the entire franchise. Animation and music are both bangers. Studio responsible for the animation have shown, that they care for the franchise and love it as much as the viewers the video was targeted to. Incredible atention to details, that make you immersed in the experience. It is the embodiment of my childhood dreams and memories and I feel really thankfull that TPC wanted to acknowledge how we as Pokemon Trainers felt during those great moments in our life. Thank You          
                              Before going to my short review of this sensational music video, I would like to talk a little about Pokémon and my love for it.
                              It would seem that to properly enjoy Gotcha!, some degree of nostalgic feeling towards Pokemon is required. Which, to be fair, is not exactly unexpected. 
                              Dull, pointless and emotionless. Meaningless nostalgia bait at it's finest.
                              The Pokémon franchise is what many would call an outlier. Its success can only be described as historic, and one of the very few franchises that bridges the generational gap. Pokémon has continued to capture the hearts of young and old alike through creativity and fun. As it nears its 25th Anniversary (also Pikachu's Pokedex number), Game Freak and Nintendo surely have some exciting things up their sleeves.
                              ""We're still a long way from where we want to go, but I could stay here the rest of my life""
                              TLDR; If you grew up playing Pokémon, whether that be you’re a former trainer or a current fan, you’ll love this music video. It’s nothing short of an epic rush of nostalgia.
                              I loved this short music video, the colours and sounds show what can happen when two giants of their industries get together and work on the same project. I liked how in the first half the pokemon that were covered by blocks of colour, were covered in their primary/main colours. I just wish we got to see more of Wally than just his back shot. It was really cool seeing pokemon show love to all generations from gen 1 all the way up to their current generation, with no one generation being given priority over another. Just a heads up to anyone that has photo-sensitivities          
                              This made me really happy and really sad. 
                              This vid came out of nowhere, and it instantly became one of my favorite things ever. The animations is incredible, there are so much frames and every single one with astonishing drawings and effects. Expressions, colors, overall direction and music tell complete stories with so little time. 
                              Okay! So, I grew up watching, playing and loving Pokemon. My earliest memories involve Pokemon!
                              Pokemon has long been a part of my childhood. It inspired me in so many ways and created so many unforgettable memories. That being said, Gotcha! was one of those works that I just don't get. Sure, some of its aspects were absolutely breathtaking, but on the other hand, so much of the actual music video was just a disappointment. Maybe I put too many expectations when I watched this, but at the end of the day, although I enjoyed it, I can't say that this rekindled my nostalgia for pokemon in any way.
                              I watch this video for breakfast. This is the best thing I've ever seen. 10/10 will watch as many times as possible. Makes my heart do the happy. Big respect for anyone and everyone who worked on this masterpiece.
                              I usually don't even add music videos to my list, let alone score them. This one pulled a 10 right out of my soul tho. ",120

These crimes share a disturbing resemblance to a similar set of homicides from 1995, when Shiki and Mikiya first met, and awaken a dark, murderous desire that has laid dormant within Shiki's soul ever since then.

With Shiki under suspicion due to her involvement in the past killings and supposed resemblance to the killer, she and Mikiya set out to find the true perpetrator. In the midst of their separate investigations, Mikiya grows increasingly concerned with Shiki's well-being and hurries to find the one responsible in order to protect Shiki from her own impulses. With the lead he receives from his cousin, police investigator Daisuke Akimi, Mikiya is led into the underbelly of Mifune City, as the salvation of Shiki's soul lies in his determination to prove her innocence once and for all.

But it takes a truly remarkable series to become memorable among the bottomless sea of anime. Kara no Kyoukai is that series.
                              I usually don't feel compelled to review animes.  I watched the entire ""Garden of sinners"" series of films and would give all of them a collective grade of 8 if I was forced to.  But after watching the seventh film, seeing nothing but rave reviews all over the web saying this is the best of the bunch, I felt I had to say something. 
                              This is the final and possibly best installment of the series Kara no Kyoukai: The Garden of Sinners. I would like to mention before I begin that if you have a minimal knowledge of the previous movies in the series this may spoil the franchise for you. Let me also say, I have not read the novels, for in a way, I wanted to savor the animation and suspense these movies bring. And boy am I glad I did. When I finished this anime, I was taken back for a moment. It's one of those few anime miracles that occur, a deep breath, an awkward

In addition, this is a review of the entire KnK series not just the 7th one. Any recommendations from fellow Kara no Kyoukai fans would also be appreciated. There might be spoilers so WATCH OUT. THANK YOU!!!)

                              This review is unnecessary. Whether or not you'll watch this depends on what you thought of the previous movies, not on these reviews. Yet, I feel like reviewing it anyway.
                              Well... this is the first time I've deviated so much from the consensus. I really wanted to like this movie, but unfortunately I just wasn't able to be entertained. I watched all seven movies on Amazon Prime video,and I liked every single entry except this one.

                              Satsujin Kousatsu (Part 2) is the final film in the Kara no Kyoukai series and I have somewhat mixed feelings on it. I'm not really going to touch on the artwork, animation, or the sound. Beautiful stuff as usual.
                              I have no idea what this show is doing anymore, it's become too hard to analyse. This movie/episode was both good and bad, parts of it were kinda fun, but there were countless bad parts mentioned below. Overall, it was fun riffing on it while watching. All good points and bad points mentioned before remain.
                              [Story: 9.0] On the whole, whether Kara no Kyoukai's storyline can be considered deep or sophisticated is debatable. However, it being a story with various intriguing concepts is undeniable. First and foremost, this is a very dialogue heavy show – minimal action, plenty of talking. In addition, the show also starts rather slowly; it takes quite a while for the scenes to set up. Thus it is not surprising that some may find it insipid. Hence, unlike other Fantasy/Magic series, Kara no Kyoukai is not about Magic in the manner of casting spells and fighting, it is more concerned with the inner workings. Nasu seems          
                              The 7th film in the Garden of sinners series doesn't disappoint. 
                              This is part 7 and the final part(not exactly) of the KnK series
                              WOW. Great way to completely ruin a multi film franchise. The other 6 movies were great but this was boring from start to finish and the ""heroes's message"" is really really childish and does not ring at all with rest of the series. Bravo
                              When I reviewed the first Kara no Kyoukai film, I thought that would be the end of it. I had no intention of continuing through the other six, but I changed my mind because the fan base was surprisingly cool and reasonable. I'm glad I did because the next five films ranged from decent to really superb. This week let's look at the seventh film in the series, Kara no Kyoukai 7: Satsujin Kousatsu (Kou). ",121

Due to this, he faces an enormous amount of pressure, both from the shogi community and his adoptive family. Seeking independence from his tense home life, he moves into an apartment in Tokyo. As a 17-year-old living on his own, Rei tends to take poor care of himself, and his reclusive personality ostracizes him from his peers in school and at the shogi hall.

However, not long after his arrival in Tokyo, Rei meets Akari, Hinata, and Momo Kawamoto, a trio of sisters living with their grandfather who owns a traditional wagashi shop. Akari, the oldest of the three girls, is determined to combat Rei's loneliness and poorly sustained lifestyle with motherly hospitality. The Kawamoto sisters, coping with past tragedies, also share with Rei a unique familial bond that he has lacked for most of his life. As he struggles to maintain himself physically and mentally through his shogi career, Rei must learn how to interact with others and understand his own complex emotions.

                              3-Gatsu was originally an anime I started watching because I love Shaft's other animes, but a few episodes in I started watching to follow along on Rei's journey. 
                              The way 3-gatsu no Lion (March comes like a lion) is written is like a poetic adventure. Only thing is, the main protagonist is in his own story and we (the audience) gets to see what they experience. From that experience, the main protagonist Rei tackles through obstacles in his life, building relationships, and growing as a person. Adapted by the manga of the same name, this is a show that really takes slice of life to a unique perspective.
                              Sangatsu no Lion is a completely pointless series, revolving around a few more than flat characters.
                              I'm going straight to the point. I've never seen a more pointless show than '3-gatsu no Lion'.
                              This review will cover both seasons of March Comes in Like a Lion.
                              SHAFT previously installed a pretentious series that suffers from a massive diagnosis of what I like to call dialogue schizophrenia, making a guy with ahoge hair look cool while he continually sexually assaults lolis; it reined in unlimited amounts of money, yatta yatta (muting the preface point with that because this studio is the bane of my existence).
                              Story 5/10 
                              Dear MAL members, do not be fooled like I did by the high score that this series obtained.
                              It's difficult to review slice-of-life shows through a critical lens. It's the one genre that is seemingly immune to poor reviews, simply because as long as the show is comforting, then it'll get a good score. I particularly like it when slice-of-life intersects with progress. Last year's Comic Girls did that, as well as Barakamon a few years back.
                              “The further you go, the steeper it becomes, and there won’t be anyone around you.” – Rei Kiriyama
                              Sangatsu no Lion is filled with important life lessons that is taught to us in style. It has great music, quality animation and a fantastic art style. All of this added with the writing makes for an experience to say the least.  I want to also mention that the first episode of this show made my heart ache pretty hard and it didn’t take long to understand why.  I felt like I understood Rei’s character quickly because I was Rei at one point. I did everything not because I enjoyed it but because it was necessary, I was unsure of what I really          
                              This review is for people who don't like Slice Of Life anime and find them boring and unbearable to watch but want to venture into the world of Slice Of Life anime.....This is NOT the anime to start!!
                              I'm Brazillian, so I'm not very welcomed with writing in another language, I ask you to be patient with my grammar and my English :). To summarize, Sangatsu no Lion is a seinen, very similar to a slice of life so if you don't have quite alike from this genre than it's better to think twice before watching it. The story maybe not be the best one, but it's great and delivers us the best of its premise. The art (as you may see) it's outstanding, we find beauty in her simplicity. The moments of tension are well animated, for example, when the characters are

I absolutely adore the novel and the 1st season of the donghua (Chinese anime) and I have been obsessed with it since I found the show last October. While this 2nd season is still beautifully animated the characters are still wonderful, the story is sorely lacking and I feel really bad for “anime only” watchers. I don’t know how they followed along with the story as its messy. It’s just difficult to follow the story if you don’t have knowledge from the novel to          
                              Mo Dao Zu Shi S1 did exceptionally well. Therefore, S2 was no exception. Like always, the animation is very good, the story is intriguing as always, and the characters never cease to amaze me, both in a good and bad way.
                              Thoroughly enjoyed the second season.
                              Season 2 doesn't disappoint.This season is just as great as the first one.
                              Capitalism lives on and I paid a membership to finish this season (8eps in total) early, here comes the review you're looking for that is not a 10.
                              Honestly, as a Chinese person, I've never found much draw in period Chinese dramas/animations. I just tend to find the idea of ancient China and notions like sworn brotherhoods over-romanticized... but Mo Dao Zu Shi drew me in easily. The music is fantastic. I don't think I've ever come across any show that made music instruments seem so cool and believable as ""weapons"". The consistent emphasis on the idea of ""cultivation"" grounds the possibility that sounds created by instruments can have that power. This ""cultivation"" affects one's personality, status in society, sense of identity etc. And instruments having powers isn't treated as a whim in          
                              (As of writing this, I have seen 6 episodes of MDZS 2. Will update when all episodes are translated.)
                              It's all about the anime ok?
                              In my opinion, the second season of Mo Dao Zu Shi got to be as good as the first, unfortunately it was much short. What bothered me about the first one is that she left many things open, events were very fast (aside from the timeline being a bit confusing). But the second explained them with great mastery. And honestly, it was a very exciting arc! Not only did Wei Xuxian have a tragic end in his other life, but also other characters that I loved very much.",127
128,"The ""Medicine Seller"" is a deadly and mysterious master of the occult who travels across feudal Japan in search of malevolent spirits called ""mononoke"" to slay. When he locates one of these spirits, he cannot simply kill it; he must first learn its Form, its Truth, and its Reason in order to wield the mighty Exorcism Sword and fight against it. He must begin  his strange exorcisms with intense psychological analysis and careful investigative work—an extremely dangerous step, as he must first confront and learn about the mononoke before he even has the means to defeat it.

The Medicine Seller's journey leads him to an old-fashioned inn where Shino, a pregnant woman, has finally found a place to rest. The owner has reluctantly placed her in the last vacant room; however, as she settles in, it quickly becomes clear that the room is infested by a lethal band of mononoke, the Zashiki Warashi. With his hunter's intuition, the Medicine Seller begins his investigation to discover the Form, the Truth, and the Reason before the Zashiki Warashi can kill again.

After giving it a chance I am glad that I wasn't quick to judge and saw it through. Mononoke is a collection of short stories revolving around mysterious spirits/creatures known as, from the title, Mononoke. The writing and directing of the series are excellently done and really immerse you in the story itself. Each arc is a new story with new characters that are well fleshed out in the beginning of each segment. The Medicine Seller, Kusuriuri, is the only recurring character and is mysterious as always with each new arc.
                              When someone talks about the genre of horror, immediately a few things come to mind: blood, violent motion, bone and flesh torn asunder, gore essentially approaching abundant forms of shock value. These are what characterize the images that litter the horror genre today. However, one cannot discount the impact of simpler techniques. Muffled voices, the bloodcurdling scream, the manic dip toward insanity; these are all subtler methods which give rise to the imagination and thus leave a more impressionable impact. Mononoke adopts such techniques in each of its standalone stories, and it may not be surprising that these implementations are often left unappreciated. Yet, by          
                              Mononoke is generally thought of as one of the most artistic shows in the medium, if not the most artistic one out there, and it is hailed as a more artistic version of the famous Anime Mushishi, filled with bright yellow and orange colors in contrast to Mushishi’s dim grey and white foggy ones, and animation that comes off as surreal for most of the time. The problem here is that this Anime, although artistically achieved what it wanted to achieve in the long run, became one of the most nauseating experiences I have ever had with an Anime, if not the most nauseating experience          
                              This is like Die Hard, but with angry spirits, a medicine seller, in Edo-period Japan.
                              The wooden curtain opens with a sinister smile revealing the first scene:
                              Deadly monsters, haunting spirits, and supernatural entities that are beyond human to even describe with words are but a few examples of what makes horror an appealing genre to many. There are great examples of works of horror that can be considered real masterpieces in its kind. However, it is undoubtedly one of the most accessible genres to not succeed in garnering pure terror within its framework. Especially with anime, where there are only a handful of noteworthy horror shows and the rest only come up with predictable scares and horror tropes being used way too much. Mononoke fits, unfortunately, to the latter; but only          
                              Mononoke is a collection of horror fairy tales, a thrilling blend of mystery, murder and the supernatural. The main and the only recurring character is the Medicine Seller, a laconic man of whom we learn almost nothing, and who, throughout the series, only using his knowledge and a handful of tools, battles the various Mononoke. 
                              Emotions, it's a powerful thing that lurks in human. It can manipulate your feelings, actions, and thoughts. Love, Hate, and other emotions can easily enter your inner-self, creating something we called Demons. Mononoke portrayed how atrocious human emotion can be, and how great an episodic anime can tell a story. 
                              You can't say you've seen 'em all until you've seen MONONOKE.

                              Mononoke appears as the continuation of the adventures of a certain character of the last arc of the series Ayakashi. To complement our viewing pleasure, some more arks were added, using an original art style and ingenious storytelling with the sole and honest objective of telling us about stories that could be our own.
                              Have you ever got to the point in watching modern anime where you're lacking that refreshing series? Do you sometimes feel the medium has become watered down and need something to reevaluate your interest in anime? To those of you who feel this way, your Lord and Savior has arrived. Enter Mononoke stage right. A bizarre 2007 release by animation giant Toei Studios (One Piece, Dragonball, Air Gear), Mononoke is unconventional, haunting, suspenseful and dramatic. Coupled with the most striking and unique art style I've come across in ages, Mononoke seeks to create a theatrical masterpiece through its uncanny vignettes. The verdict? Well, you’ll just          
                              First of all: this anime is a masterpiece, and I do REALLY mean it.
                              I'll try too keep this review rather short and concise, but I'll probably just start rambling and won't be able to stop myself if I get out of hand. Since I'm such a rambler, please forgive me if it sometimes seems somewhat unorganized even though I'll do some organizing when it's done. If you're not bothered to read the whole things I wrote 3 pros and 3 cons at the bottom.
                              Lately I have found that I like shows that have an overall goal for the plot and character development in stead of the episodic, story-arc-of-the-week, formula, but Mononoke is an example of the episodic formula done right while also going all-out, resulting in a very unique show.",128

The shy and unapproachable girl is deemed an embarrassment to the family, and finds herself ostracized by her father's relatives, all of them refusing to take care of her in the wake of his death. Daikichi, angered by their coldness towards Rin, announces that he will take her in—despite the fact that he is a young, single man with no prior childcare experience.

Usagi Drop is the story of Daikichi's journey through fatherhood as he raises Rin with his gentle and affectionate nature, as well as an exploration of the warmth and interdependence that are at the heart of a happy, close-knit family.

                              Secretly funded by the Japanese government to combat declining birth rates, project ""USAGI DROP"" targeted a very specific, generally non-reproductive demographic of the Japanese population: the otaku. At the core of the project was a 11 episode television series that was specifically designed to thoroughly rouse hibernating paternal instincts. Researchers noted a 41% increase in the desire to have children in males in their 20s to 30s who watched a single episode of Usagi Drop. Researchers also noted that of that 41%, 77% of those males explicitly stated that they wanted daughters. One of the biggest advantages project USAGI DROP had over its predecessor, project          
                              To be Frank, I was skeptical about committing to watching Usagi Drop having read all the manga. Adaptations are great and all, but boy oh boy the direction source material (manga) took betrayed my expectations, leaving me doubtful about this as a whole.
                              God. I suppose this was best time in my life for me to watch this series. I just went through a lot of stress with family and this really helped me understand some of the things that go on when you're a parent, even a single parent. I'm not gonna say the cliche stuff like ""It's never easy being a parent."" and I can't say anything from experience, as I am not a father or legal guardian. But I was raised by a single mother without a father in my life until 7 years ago.
                              Story:
                              UD is a parenting manual. It is an anime that deals with the issues of raising a kid and how you must pretty much sacrifice everything for it. There are no boobs or giant robots here; this is so much slice of life it is practically bleeding. 
                              Usagi Drop started out as a manga by Unita Yumi. The anime adaptation was handled by Production I.G. It's also the second Josei series I've been asked to review. The other being Nodame Cantabile. Let's take a look at Usagi Drop and see how it compares.
                              Usagi Drop is a breath of fresh air for those who are a bit tired with the excessive amounts of fanservice, dull characters, and even duller plots that seem to plague the medium. For once we can have an anime that touches upon issues in a serious and honest manner, while having just about the right amount of lightheartedness and humor that prevents the series from getting too heavy. The result is a heartwarming, feel good tale that manages to allow viewers to empathize with the characters and perhaps the show as a whole to be adorable without feeling that they are being insulted.
                              Slice of life is generally a tricky genre to get right. When I say slice of life, I don't mean those dime-a-dozen high school comedies the industry has become oversaturated with as of late. Rather, I refer to series that find something meaningful to explore through the small conflicts of commonplace events. All too often, attempts at this genre come off as either excessive and unnatural or dull and listless. It stands to reason, then, that the best shows of this kind are the ones that introduce unfamiliar elements that make these characters' lives distinct from our own, while still staying in touch with the          
                              Children are no easy task to take care of. They require a lot of attention and patience to deal with. As a child, I was reckless and very stubborn. I'm glad my parents dealt with me and loved me for who I am. Though when a family member dies, a person can change in a way to make them more secluded and feeling alone, but when someone reaches out to you with love and care, they can change back.
                              Script - A guy takes care of a girl. Implications? She gets happier than before. Guy becomes more responsible. New connections are established on a superficial level and by the end what you have is a guide on how to raise children that actually doesn't work. Why? Because the child in question isn't a child, but an adult. A smaller version of it at least. She's so mature it is not even fun to see the protagonist parenting, we know it is not necessary. The only reason why the initial relationship between the two takes place is that she's traumatized due her father's death. That

                              Beautiful...a word often used in the realms of the arts, except of course in anime. Anime is often comical, action packed, suspenseful, mysterious, heart-warming...but it is rare when one can truly describe an anime as being beautiful.

                              As a kid, I often searched for inspirations through celebrity pop stars, acclaimed sportsmen, and even fictional characters wearing underpants outside of their trousers.

131,"During the early 1930s in Chicago, the transcontinental train, Flying Pussyfoot, is starting its legendary journey that will leave a trail of blood all over the country. At the same time in New York, the ambitious scientist Szilard and his unwilling aide Ennis are looking for missing bottles of the immortality elixir. In addition, a war between the mafia groups is getting worse. On board the Advena Avis, in 1711, alchemists are about to learn the price of immortality.

Based on the award-winning light novels of the same name, Baccano! follows several events that initially seem unrelated, both in time and place, but are part of a much bigger story—one of alchemy, survival, and immortality. Merging these events together are the kindhearted would-be thieves, Isaac and Miria, connecting various people, all of them with their own hidden ambitions and agendas, and creating lifelong bonds and consequences for everyone involved.

[Written by MAL Rewrite] ",8.42,8,144,129,717071,21887,"                              Baccano! is a series with a huge fanbase who see in it as a wonderful ensemble of colorful characters, complex web of interwoven plots and wonderfully jazzy soundtrack. 
                              Throughout my childhood, I wasn't really much into movies or the whole moving picture theater idea when I was young. I was more into video games and playing outside. All that changed when i watched a certain movie called Reservoir Dogs. At first, I was only into it simply because of the blood and violence. But further throughout my multiple viewings, I realized that the story and acting was also a big part of my fascination to this particular film. Then a few years after that another movie created by the same person came out called Pulp Fiction. This was done  in the same          
                              Baccano! has a great reputation among many American fans, who lauded its boundless energy, larger than life characters, and unconventional narrative style. As I eventually watched it, I discovered that Baccano! indeed has all that stuff and could understand why so many people love it. And yet, curiously enough it never ascended beyond a mildly entertaining show for me. 
                              Title: Baccano!
                              Baccano! Is a Shounen, Supernatural, Action, Adventure, Comedy series with a very attention-grabbing and peculiar story style that&rsquo;s entertaining to watch. There&rsquo;s plenty excitement and laughs to be had however prepare to be lost, at some point, in the numerous, connected storylines. ^_^  
                              Never before has so much madness been crammed into so short a series.
                              It bothers me to say I took a while to realize the quality of ""Baccano!"". Aside from boasting no less than 18 main characters, the Pulp Fiction-esque narrative would constantly fracture and leap back and forth in time. I didn't like that I had to make an effort to constantly focus and be forced to remember so many names and faces; three episodes in, I was feeling frustrated and close to losing interest. Something needed to be done and in a last ditch attempt to salvage the series, it became clear I'd have to wait it out, build up the fansubs and spend a long          
                              I’m sure most people are fully aware in this decade that Baccano is a tale of three stories told in different timelines that are told all at once through a combination of Guy Ritchie and Quentin Tarantino’s styles. Each story is largely self-contained, but some of the same characters are present in each story (ex. Isaac and Miria in the 1930 and 31 stories) and/or related to characters from a different story. As the first half of the introductory episode states, Baccano is a story with no beginnings, no endings, and no main character. It’s just pure undiluted chaos the entire way through, constantly jumping          
                              After finishing Baccano!...  I can't help but name it a truly mediocre and barely entertaining really obnoxious show.
                              It is said by many (Livejournal users), that everyone has a story inside them just waiting to be told. 
                              In anime, we should automatically celebrate when something like Baccano is tossed away. We should revel in what a delicious candy we are gorging down... but also realize that its still a candy.
                              Click. BANG! That's the signal! Grab your stylish hat, your most powerful gun, and employ your sixth sense (you'll need it!). What Baccano! confronts you with is exciting, fun, mildly disturbing and incredibly unique.
                              Baccano is not only a great example of what can happen when a series is based on a series of novels, but also a refreshing reminder of why I watch anime.
                              When was the last time that you were stuck in a traffic jam and looked around you, only to find all the other drivers’ expressions mirror yours exactly? The frustration, the annoyance and the exasperation plastered all across their faces, each telling a story of their own, as loud horns blare in the background. The irritated young fellow next to you might be rushing because he has a huge presentation to make in front of the office’s senior officials. The middle-aged woman in the minivan behind you might be furious because her son got into trouble at university and they were calling her over when          
                              I kept putting off Bacanno because the art really shouted out to me and, as vain a conclusion as this is, I thought the art was an insight into how good the show was going to be, and therefore put it off for when I was having a bad day and just wanted a really good show to pick me up. Ufortunately Bacanno doesn't reach that excellence for me, but it certainly isn't a bad show.",131
132,"Hunters are specialized in a wide variety of fields, ranging from treasure hunting to cooking. They have access to otherwise unavailable funds and information that allow them to pursue their dreams and interests. However, being a hunter is a special privilege, only attained by taking a deadly exam with an extremely low success rate.

Gon Freecss, a 12-year-old boy with the hope of finding his missing father, sets out on a quest to take the Hunter Exam. Along the way, he picks up three companions who also aim to take the dangerous test: the revenge-seeking Kurapika, aspiring doctor Leorio Paladiknight, and a mischievous child the same age as Gon, Killua Zoldyck.

Hunter x Hunter is a classic shounen that follows the story of four aspiring hunters as they embark on a perilous adventure, fighting for their dreams while defying the odds.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.42,8,145,321,418976,9591,"                              First off, for the sake of simplicity I'm going to cover all four series (one TV series and three OVAs) in one review, since they actually form a single continuous story. 
                              No matter the version, HxH is my favorite shounen series of all time. This adaptation is my favorite despite lacking the new story arcs (:
                              Hunter x Hunter is your typical Shounen, Action, Adventure anime with the usual plot-devices but with a pretty unique concept of &ldquo;hunting&rdquo;. This series may not adrenaline filled action sequences but it is still highly enjoyable, with plenty of tension.
                              The basic premise of the story is Gon, a young boy living on Whale Island, one day meets an apprentice of his father. This hunter tells him about his long lost father, Ging, and awakens in Gon the desire to become a hunter in order to find his father. Along the way to the Professional Hunter Exams, Gon meets and befriends Killua (from an assassin family), Kurapica (last survivor of a tribe murdered by the Ryodan) and Leorio (who wants to be a doctor).
                              Hunters… What do you think about when you hear this?  An Anime about people killing poor cute animals?  Of course this is not it, all the animals are ugly! lol
                              Overall: 
                              Note: This review will encompass the main series and the OVAs since they all flow together. There might be some minor spoilers, depending on what you consider a spoiler.
                              First, I will state watched this series at least 3 times. You may be thinking I'm quite biased, especially giving it a 10. But that's how I really feel since this Anime always manages to excite me yet give me a wide range of emotions. Mostly excite though ( I find it to be an adrenaline pumping Anime )
                              The lack of fandom surrounding Hunter X Hunter is somewhat enigmatic to me. It is a title that, by all rights, should have a huge buzz behind it. Not only is Hunter X Hunter the work of Yoshihiro Togashi, the creator of Yu Yu Hakusho, but it is also far superior to other currently running big-hype titles, the most prominent of which is Naruto. It manages to be enormously entertaining through its unique concoction of animation, characterization, and plot, without resorting to the cliches that have all too often ruined a seemingly novel show of a similar vein. And yet Hunter X Hunter remains little          
                              One of my all time favourites, I\'ve re-watched this anime 3 times and I\'m not tired of it yet. The series include a balance of humour, plot, action and character, not to mention there were no filler episodes, unlike some other action-based shounen anime.Also, unlike some other action-bases series where the storyline is pretty much predictable, Hunter x Hunter isn\'t - in fact, it contained many twists that I wouldn\'t had expected (example: re-examination of the 2nd round exam in the Hunter Exam). The anime illustrated some important lessons in life, such as friendship, determination and teamwork, through scenarios that might actually happen in real          
                              As a fan of HxH 2011 I thought to myself it would be fun to watch the first anime  adaption and compare the two of them, this review will therefore refer to the 2011 adaption from time to time. This is also why this is supposed to mostly aim for those who have already watched HxH-11. This review will be reviewing the anime series and its 3 ovas which makes it 92 episodes long instead of 62.
                              I'm not a big shonen follower. I dislike long anime. Yet Hunter x Hunter, from the creator of Yu Yu Hakusho, managed to sneak its way into my top 5 anime of all time. 
                              I'm sure you know about the series if you've found my review so I'll give my thoughts.
                              I cannot recommend this anime for anything but comparison since the 2011 anime came out. While there may be a bias on my part having seen the 2011 adaptation first, if I had seen this version first I likely would have never stuck with the series to become a part of the fandom.
                              Hunter x Hunter, I' watched the show once in a former television channel, since at first glance the series did not seem flashy, but continued talking of my friends about the series I did buy it in format disc that had Fortune had a store discs needed.",132

As an adult (supposedly), you feel slightly out of place but the child in you just wants to jump up and down with them in frantic jubilation without a care in the world. There is a cake too: a black forest with strawberry toppings and as you immerse yourself in the jovial mood, you admit that the feeling of sharing a slice with everyone is sweeter than the cake itself.
                              Barakamon is a work of art. However, it’s more than just calligraphy as words alone cannot describe the exact nature and discovery of Barakamon. For instance, the show takes place on an island involving a young man named Seishuu Handa. Coming from a more urban based background, his life changes forever as he finds his new life on the natural island of Goto. Of course, this doesn’t happen after he delivers a sucker punch to an elder curator. When someone throws a fit like that, it’s easy to guess that consequences are destined to follow. But can we really call a journey to Goto Island          
                              One of the hallmarks of a quality slice of life show is its ability to make you forget about the real world and immerse you in their world, if only for a few minutes. You laugh alongside the characters as they do silly things, get anxious as they struggle through trials and tribulations, and then feel relieved when those problems are resolved. Barakamon does an excellent job of accentuating this aspect of the slice of life genre. Through a cast of quirky and unique characters along with simple yet powerful storytelling, Barakamon portrays the life of a man who strives to discover his true identity          
                              When the last season of animes started, i was looking forward for just three animes: Tokyo Ghoul, Akame ga Kill and SAO2. Nothing more than that. I wasn't a big fan of slice of life anime, even though i had watched some after, i used to think that this genre was boring.
                              Without fail, this anime had me in stitches after hours and hours of watching all the episodes for 2 days. (sorry, I didn't finish it in one because of chores.)  
                              Our surroundings shape us.
                              Some 'people' may describe Slice of Life is nothing but a boring genre, the phrase for someone who dislike SOL is ""Why do we have to watch anime that tells the life we live day to day?"", but the truth is not like that. One of the main objectives of a Slice of Life genre is delivering a straight message of life itself. And Barakamon is a great example to prove that.
                              Well, my review got deleted for not following the guidelines so I uploaded it. ~
                              Without a doubt, Barakamon is one of the most relaxing anime out there in existence. If I had to describe Barakamon in short, it would be that it has been, a true panacea. 
                              This anime is definitely a refreshing and unique slice of life anime, watching it gives me nostalgia of whenever I have failed at something and had build evaluate and try again, which I’m sure everyone can relate. Watching the show and characters interact is a great joy; seeing each person going through new experiences and emotions. Barakamon is definitely a wonderful addition to the slice of life genre, that people can relate to and enjoy. 
                              Often, the slice-of-life genre is viewed as what is more or less the Seinfeld genre of anime - that they are ""shows about nothing."" This is by no means a bad thing - shows like Non Non Biyori to a stellar job of proving that a show about the most inane daily activities can be greatly entertaining and sometimes even emotional. But that is also no excuse to produce SoL shows that have no true plot or character development. And that's where Barakamon comes in.
                              ‘Barakamon’ is a rare kind of story. Something that is just so simple, yet so powerful. There are no big expositions of drama and no complicated plotlines, none of that is needed in the slightest. The story is simple, easy to grasp, and beautiful to watch as it plays out. In its purest form, it’s simply the story of an arrogant (but still kind-hearted) young man that simply can’t seem to let go of his pride, and how he matures from the time he spends with the townsfolk of his new home. 
                              This anime is one of the best I've seen in recent history. The story, though simple, is heartwarming in the truest form. The episodes are mostly day-to-day adventures, but each one is clever, uplifting, and very often hilarious.
                              Well first review, I'll go for it... What could I say: this anime may not have action or romance but it has something very few animes could claim to have: authenticity. The characters are coherent, natural and really lovable. The overall art is great and some scenes are truly astonishing. In term of personal enjoyment, it has been a while since I smiled so much during an anime: the humor of the situations is light and there're a lot of heartwarming scenes. Too short might've been the only flaw but the ending was at a perfect place to stop. It was damn near perfect, im          
                              Barakamon…  Ah, the feeling of watching something so laid-back is really refreshing. First thing that came into my mind when I heard Barakamon was, to tell you the truth, Digimon. I’m sorry, I really am! Good thing I was wrong. Phew. * wipes sweat *",133

                              Grand Blue is a Zero-G comedic anime from last year. I can't speak to the quality of their work in general since I only found thirteen titles listed for them and haven't seen any of them. It's based off of a manga by Inoue Kenji. Well, I like a lot of slice of life comedies so this may be relevant to my interests. Let's take a look. 
                              Amazing show, comedy is great and story moves fast
                              ------SPOILER-FREE-------- (It's a comedy anime tho so like idek why I'm saying this)
                              Grand Blue isn't 'breath-hard-out-your-nose' funny, it's a 'hurt-your-stomach' kind of hilarious. Each of the characters are so unique, and I was just captivated by how their different personalities compliment each other to create the funny setting and tone. 
                              - It's a very light and fun anime, the episodes end and you don't even notice. The jokes and situations are great and at many times you laugh a lot.
                              Grand Blue - in search of a sports anime it was no coincidence that I came across this anime that explicitly mentions one of the most beautiful hobbies and sports as part of the story, scuba diving. Since I had not read the manga yet, I did not know what to expect. If my review does not start with the kanji, that's not a good sign. In other words, anyone who likes the anime and hopes to find an echo chamber will be as disappointed as I am of this anime.
                              I don't review many shows but this series in particular really needed one.  It's the true epitome of a ""mixed bag"" show. It has everything in position to be memorable, meaningful, and beautiful. It then throws most of this potential in the trash in favor of the crudest jokes, the most minimal animation and art, and an unfulfilling story.
                              I was feeling a bit down yesterday so I decided to try out a comedy anime for the first time and alas, I feel great and happy. This is how I feel about this anime if I have to put it out in a sentence.
                              Grand Blue are an anime that just really fun to watch and enjoy. Whilst taking a set of college life and a club, the comedy and puns it delivers are just a remarkable one. Despite unfriendly to underage viewers, it was very acceptable and relates more for middle-aged viewer. ",134
135,"In the mysterious future, crystalline organisms called Gems inhabit a world that has been destroyed by six meteors. Each Gem is assigned a role in order to fight against the Lunarians, a species who attacks them in order to shatter their bodies and use them as decorations. 

Phosphophyllite, also known as Phos, is a young and fragile Gem who dreams of helping their friends in the war effort. Instead, they are told to compile an encyclopedia because of their delicate condition. After begrudgingly embarking on this task, Phos meets Cinnabar, an intelligent gem who has been relegated to patrolling the isolated island at night because of the corrosive poison their body creates. After seeing how unhappy Cinnabar is, Phos decides to find a role that both of the rejected Gems can enjoy. Houseki no Kuni follows Phos' efforts to be useful and protect their fellow Gems.

                              The GRRM Reaper once posited the Furniture Rule: that at its core, literature is an exploration of the human condition; the rest is fluff, furniture.
                              Over the last few years or so the discussion regarding the use of CGI in anime has grown all the more prominent which in turn has led to disdain from fans, devaluing any show that would dare to use it. This normally wouldn't be a problem, but the overreliance on this technology and the way in which it incorporated with traditional animation, unfortunately, leaves much to be desired. The end product is usually a show that looks bizarre as the two modes of animation don't make clear, visual, coherence sense. CGI is a wonderful tool and I believe it should be used in anime, but          
                              I am writing this review because I believe I hold an uncommon opinion. Don’t worry, it’s spoiler free. Allow me the time to tell you a story.

                              [SPOILER WARNING]
                              Gems are regarded as precious things. There are a plethora of these beautiful, varied jewels, each with distinct colors to catch the eye. Out of this shimmering rouges-gallery, the most popular one may be the diamond. 
                              So Houseki no Kuni. Wow.
                              THIS REVIEW WILL BE SPOILER FREE
                              Note: I have not read the source material (manga), so this review will be based on the anime alone.
                              My only problem with this show is that mainly all of the character development goes into Phos and no one else, which kind of ruined her character for me. As she change too much, too fast and she ended up as a completely different character by the end which I didn’t like. All the other characters in the show either get no development or very little development.
                              Land of the Lustrous is remarkable. At times, it can lull you into a state of awe as you realize how gorgeous a full CG show can be whilst also giving you a sense of fear and danger at the situation the characters find themselves in. This show does both of these things very well. The characters are all made of different kinds of gemstone and this matters as it dictates what role they excel in this society.
                              Beautiful and emotional, 
                              BEAUTIFUL. STUNNING. GORGEOUS. LUSTROUS!  This anime, by far, is the most beautifully animated series I have ever seen.  It is a shining example of how 3D Animation is the future of anime.  I have seen a lot of beautifully animated series in my life, but this one, in my humble opinion, out shined them all.  It was easily the biggest draw of the anime.  I can't ever remember a time where I would rewind just to watch a character run.  But, the animation combined with the motion and camera angles made even running, a spectacular sight.

Well, let me start by saying Tenki no Ko is a great continuation of the form that Shinkai's been in for the past decade starting with Garden of Words. The character designs, story, pacing, art, animation and sound are all top notch as to be expected.
                              [This review contains spoilers, because I wasn't able to explain why I didn't like this movie without speaking of specific story events and character roles in the narrative]
                              After having just watched Tenki  no Ko in Koufu, I have decided I'll make this my first review, which I'll make spoiler free and using the categorisation format. I am currently stuck between whether I'd call this movie a 9 or a 10, so as I've only seen it once and don't want to over analyse, enjoyment comes first after all,  I've put the lower to account for that hype we all feel when we first watch an anticipated release. 
                              First of all let me say this
                              When the trailer for Tenki no Ko first released, I think I wasn't the only one who leapt out of my seat and screamed for joy, sharing it on all the social media platforms. The staff lineup was looking quite similar to Kimi no Na wa (Your Name), meaning it could possibly reach the same heights as the film which brought Makoto Shinkai to the spotlight of anime media. I was very hyped for it, and finally got to watch it this weekend, when it released. So how was it?
                              Despite the overwhelming reviews saying that this is a masterpiece, nobody I personally know actually enjoyed this film... We were all disappointed. That's what this movie is major disappointment. 
                              Another beautiful masterpiece created by CoMix Wave Films, a studio that made Kimi no Nawa. and Kotonoha no Niwa. as well as other amazing movies and shows such as Everything Flows and 5 Centimeter. 
                              While Kimi no Na Wa. felt like Makoto Shinkai proving himself to the world, Tenki no Ko feels like the auteur simply being himself-- because it's time for the world to get to know him.
                              ""Weathering with you"" is a plate of spaghetti with very questionable ingredients that seems to be there for the sake of looking good, and despite it's grand presentation complete with truffles and gold plate, you can tell that the presentation is only there to hide it's many flaws, the half-cooked linguine, the hastily cooked sauce and the utter arrogance you can sense from the kitchen, expecting you to forgive all those flaws because of the restaurant's prestige.
                              Hello, this is my first time writing a review on something, I don't know why but I feel the need to write this after watching and reading the review below 7, but don't worry, I'm not here to ignite any argument with you, this is just an opinion from the prespective of a 19 years old.
                              [Spoilers ahead]
                              [No spoilers included]
                              Time to flood this review section with my showering praises! Bad joke sorry. Being serious though, if I want to summarize Tenki no Ko with one phrase, that will be, lacking of confidence to make bold moves. Yes, I actually said that on a film that our best boy, Makoto Shinkai made. He has always made really bold moves on his movie with no drawbacks at all. However, Tenki no Ko felt different. It felt as if he was being nervous when he was producing this film, there was that sense of nervousness inside the story. Not a smart play there, my friend, many people          
                              TLDR Review at the bottom. Hopefully, that helped, in advance.
                              This is Shinkai’s worst film yet. He had a mixed record in the past, from the quality entertainment of Your Name to the embarrassing Studio Ghibli “homage” Children who Chase Lost Voices. But Weathering with You somehow sets the bar even lower. Its unoriginality is pathetic and its self-indulgence repulsive. ",139

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.4,8,153,799,188571,721,"                              Over the years of watching anime, none has touched me more deeply than Violet Evergarden TV series. For me, it was everything that a TV series could offer. Therefore, I was excited to hear that Violet Evergarden Gaiden will be coming to theaters in September. After I watched it on the release date in Tokyo, I can safely say that it is a masterpiece in every aspect.
                              Violet Evergarden Gaiden: Eien to Jidou Shuki Ningyou serves as another episode of Violet Evergarden but longer than usual. 

                              ""Violet Evergarden"" is a show that I love since the first time I have seen it. Is creative, is smart, is Sutil, it knows how to make a good drama, the animation is just beautiful. One of my favorite anime (and animation titles in general) of all time, has a 10/10 from me...
                              this is not the best story I have ever seen from the story of ""Violet Evergarden""
                              Violet Evergarden Gaiden is a side story to the main series and this is another tale of Violet's journey during her time as an Auto Memory Doll. Overall this 90-minute movie is a pleasant watch that goes along well with the spirit of the series - telling touching stories about human bonds and emotions, how they are expressed and how it empowers one to change for the better.
                              Minor spoilers to the film and SAO within the review
                              I have generally been a fan of this series, which is both beautifully written and beautifully animated. So this review pertains only to this specific movie and not to the series overall. I still love Violet Evergarden, even through its most sentimental moments. 
                              So here's my spoiler-Free Review:
                              I love this movie. Watching it on theaters was such a beautiful experience. I didn't regret it at all.
                              Literally one of the most beautiful anime movie ever made. (Probably the most beautiful so far.)
                              After the disappointment that was to me Violet Evergarden (TV), I'm pleased to afirm Gaiden is a nice step forward.
                              ヴァイオレット・エヴァーガーデン 外伝 -永遠と自動手記人形-  A wonderful feature-length episode that enchantingly follows in the footsteps of world-famous literature. A superb standalone episode that both visually and narratively engages the viewer with logically and believably developing characters in beautiful and breathtaking art and animation.
                              This is basically like Violet Evergarden : episode 14. 
                              Animation doesn't need much to speak about. Simply, it's as breath taking as what Violet Evergarden has been so far. It's a very slow movie with intimate character interactions. The movie has the same formate as an episode of the show, just played out longer. Violet has her time with the characters, we grow attached, and then we get the background that makes them interesting. Seeing Violet take her affect on the characters, as well as how they effect her is shown very well. It overall a very quiet and calm movie. It has it's very emotional moments, as well and some humor thrown in          ",140
141,"With the serialization of their new manga, ""Detective Trap,"" the writer-artist team, Akito Takagi and Moritaka Mashiro, better known by their pseudonym Muto Ashirogi, are one step closer to becoming world-renowned mangaka. For Mashiro, however, serialization is just the first step. Having promised to marry his childhood sweetheart and aspiring voice actress, Azuki Miho, once his manga gets an anime adaptation, Mashiro must continue his to popularize Ashirogi's work. A tremendously competitive cast of ambitious mangaka—including the wild genius, Eiji Niizuma; the elegant student, Yuriko Aoki, and her older admirer and partner, Takurou Nakai; the lazy prodigy, Kazuya Hiramaru; and the abrasive artist, Shinta Fukuda—both support and compete against Muto Ashirogi in creating the next big hit.

As they adjust to their young and seemingly untested new editor, the dynamic duo struggle to maintain their current serialization, secure the top stop in Shounen Jack, and ultimately, achieve an anime adaptation of their manga. With new rivals and friends, Bakuman. 2nd Season continues Takagi and Mashiro's inspiring story of hard work and young love.

[Written by MAL Rewrite] ",8.4,8,154,490,290097,1382,"                              I had watched the first season along with a few episodes of the second season a while ago, but I had to stop for some reason I can't remember. So, I decided to go back and start the second season from the beginning. Bad idea...
                              Bakuman is both entertaining and educational. It shows that it's not so simple to write or draw something that people will appreciate. If you want to make something truly good, you might have to revise and redo it several times as they do in this series. I like that Bakuman shows how difficult it is; it makes it more realistic. It's still entertaining at an anime level, though, since the characters passionately aim for the top. 
                              First of all let me begin by saying this Anime is written by Tsugumi Ohba and illustrated by Takeshi Obata who made Death Note and unlike some of the other works that have been produced since this anime has the special sauce too. MAYONNAIISEEE.
                              *This review covers Season 2 with Minor Spoilers of Season 1 & 2
                              I can distinguish this series from its prequel and sequel due to some powerful scenes (which I will not spoil). To me, that makes it special, but other people might think the real value is elsewhere.
                              Bakuman season 2 continues the realistic life of a manga artist. What they go through and how they have to deal with them.  Just when things are getting good, something tragic happens and we get to see how the characters handle this situations. 
                              Quote from Mashiro, slight spoiler from episode 25 but for a good reason.
                              Just finishing the first season I fell in love with this series and quickly moved onto the 2nd and folks.....it did not drop the ball in anyway
                              I first started the Bakuman series because it sounded interesting and because it was rated highly; I'm an on and off manga fan, so I didn't think that it would appeal to me, but I was wrong. This led me onto the second series, which I found to be pretty much just as good as the first.
                              Normally, the second season always sucks or it's not as interesting as the first one but... 
                              Bakuman 2 has proven to be an excellent story demonstrating the Tsugumi/Takeshi pair capability to handle another genre of manga/anime. Someone who hasn't done there background look on the creators may not have even noticed it was the same team that brought us the masterpiece, Death Note. The art is very bright and while some mangaka's style can be evidently recognised in all of their work (eg. Mitsuru Adachi), this team's art in Bakuman is much different from the previously produced Death Note. 
                              ""More of the same"" has never rung so true, and yet have been so fulfilling.
                              I am not good at reviews but I will make this short and try not to put spoilers into it.
                              Bakuman is a super realistic lens into the life of mangakas, and considering the fact that the people who made Bakuman is also an artist/author pair -just like the main protagonists-, I wouldn't be surprised if this anime was a remixed story about their life after making Death Note, which is hinted at in season 3. With 3 seasons and 75 episodes, Bakuman is obviously pretty long for a realistic work, and if I were to rank them from best to worst: 3, 2, 1. 
                              And so, the daily lives and struggles of becoming the Number 1# Shounen Jack mangaka goes on...with harsher trials and tribulations for Ashirogi Muto!",141

At its head is Integra Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing, who commands a powerful military and spends her life fighting the undead.

Integra's vast army, however, pales in comparison with her ultimate weapon: the vampire Alucard, who works against his own kind as an exterminator for Hellsing. With his new vampire servant, Seras Victoria, at his side, Alucard must battle not only monsters, but all those who stand to oppose Hellsing, be they in the guise of good or evil.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.4,8,155,143,679502,18227,"                              My friends, 
                              Hellsing Ultimate is genuinely one of the dumbest Anime one would get the displeasure of watching. It boggles the mind how people think this Anime is good or even great by extension, and seeing the amount of praise it gets boggles the mind, as this one suffers from many major problems which cannot be overlooked. So, what are the problems that Hellsing Ultimate suffers from? 
                              Overview:
                              I get sick of shows that are supposedly brutal bloodbaths *very* easily. Why is that? Well I go into it thinking I'm gonna experience just that and instead all I get is a whole lot of bad pacing and tiny little splashes of blood that are heavily censored for no good reason whatsoever with a protagonist that can't shut the fuck up with his bitching. Of course, it's not surprising this is the case since I was spoiled ROTTEN by Hellsing Ultimate. Hellsing Ultimate is the epitome of senseless violence and sheer brutality. Fuck your Mirai Nikki, Deadman Wonderland, and Tokyo Ghoul! THIS is a          
                              I'll keep it sorta brief: this series was pretty shitty. When I started watching it years ago, I thought it was one of the coolest things I ever saw. That gradually shifted to ""What's going on in this story?"" and later ""Why am I even watching this?""
                              Hellsing Ultimate is the definition of badass. From the over-the-top characters to the insane plot to the violent, blood-spewing fights, it is the disregard of all that is holy and possibly the most intense, balls-to-the-wall anime ever made. It’s also the epitome of style over substance, featuring some of the best animation of any series to date, superb voice acting, and a fine soundtrack, but little in terms of plot or character development. It’s Michael Bay doing an anime about Nazi vampires. It’s Japan’s answer to Hellboy. In short, it’s an exquisitely done pure action/horror, but not much else.
                              If there's one word to sum up Hellsing Ultimate, it's 'Style'. The art is gorgeous. The animation is fluid. The fight scenes are well executed with with lots of gore and body parts (as you'd hope for in an adult series about vampires), trash talk, and cool poses, and the imagery is breathtaking.
                              Following my conflicted experience with Hellsing TV, I stumbled onto Studio Madhouse efforts into creating an anime that follows the source material of its manga to a much closer degree. Instead of a standard weekly airing schedule, Madhouse decided to go with releasing a total of ten OVAs over an agonizing long six years. In doing so, they have rectify most of the problems that marred the potential of Gonzo's effort.   
                              Hellsing Ultimate has everything you want and expect from a vampire series revolving around the greatest vampire of them all: Dracula. Only in this series we know him under the name of Alucard. This show is rated R for a reason, a bloody good reason. It contains blood, gore, big breasted female leads and even more blood.
                              Hellsing Ultimate provides the background and plot that was missing in the original Hellsing series.  However, it exchanges a lot of the more intimate moments and character development present in the original series for violence and battle scenes.  There is also a lot more vulgarity present in this version.   The anime presentation style oscillates between more detailed and dark, to lower quality, to classic flat animation during moments that are supposed to be silly.  The switching animation styles works sometimes, but in this series it feels out of place with the overall darkly dangerous atmosphere of the story.  The          
                              If any readers are avid fans of Hellsing, please turn back now. 
                              Have you ever read Bram Stokers Dracula? Have you ever wondered what happened afterwards? If the answer to both of these questions are yes then do I have a show for you, but first I recommend taking an assortment of drugs (much like the creators of this show) to receive the full effect. Do you have your cocaine lines ready? Alright before you make sweet love to that let me tell you my thoughts. 
                              This is actually my first Anime review, and since I am rather new to Anime, I may not look like the most experienced person ever, so be gentle with me. However, I've read some guidelines and know how a good review should actually look like. Let's hope I do well then.

                              Hellsing Ultimate is a title I remember looking so forward to years ago when I first heard about it, and just about as fast as it piqued my interest upon initial viewing, it sent my expectations crashing down into a ball of flames. In truth, this is one anime I had dropped over a year ago and didn't regret too much doing it. I decided to come back into it very recently through a fresh take and finally finish it. For the most part I wish that my time was better invested somewhere else.  Hellsing Ultimate indeed has plenty of tools to become one          ",142
143,"Following the successful Sanyou campaign, the Qin army, including 1,000-Man Commander Li Xin, inches ever closer to fulfilling King Ying Zheng's dream of unifying China. With a major geographical foothold in the state of Wei now under its control, Qin sets its sights eastward toward the remaining warring states.

Meanwhile Li Mu—an unparalleled strategist and the newly appointed prime minister of the state of Zhao—has taken advantage of Zhao's temporary truce with Qin to negotiate with the other states without interruption. Seemingly without warning, Ying Zheng receives news that armies from the states of Chu, Zhao, Wei, Han, Yan, and Qi have crossed into Qin territory. Realizing too late the purpose behind Li Mu's truce with Qin, Zheng quickly gathers his advisors to devise a plan to address the six-state coalition army on their doorstep. For the first time in history, the state of Qin faces complete destruction and must use every resource and strategy at their disposal to prevent themselves from being wiped off the map.

The amount of politics, resources, and devotion that went into this coalition required every participant’s sacrifice. A coalition that no other kingdoms or states could ever dream of. Even after the warring states period of China. Qin, a state that has lost its six great generals system,          
                              Kingdom Is OP From the plot to the action, its an anime that gets your blood pumping and ready for action I 100% recommend this to everyone. 
                              This is my first ever anime review, I feel I have to give this anime credit where credit is due because it is the most underrated anime I have ever had the pleasure of watching, do not let the lack of reviews/popularity fool you, it is one of the best animes I have seen. 
                              This is far from a 9 or 10
                              Season 3 of Kingdoms absolutely nailed it!!! S3 starts almost immediately after the military and political events after S2 so i consider it a direct sequel to S2 a few years back. What suprised me in S3 is that the anime jumps right into the plot and military action, no unnecessary fillers, or overly emotional moments. The animation is even better than that of S2 which was already a lot better compared to the bad animation of the first Season of Kingdoms.
                                 I very much enjoy this season over the last 2 seasons. There is no CGI and it is completely hand-drawn which is very good (the CGI was trash in the last two seasons). The 2D animation I feel is pretty good, I had a bit of whiplash getting used to the new style but once you do it feels like a huge improvement over the last two seasons. ",143
144,"All of a sudden, they arrived: parasitic aliens that descended upon Earth and quickly infiltrated humanity by burrowing into the brains of vulnerable targets. These insatiable beings acquire full control of their host and are able to morph into a variety of forms in order to feed on unsuspecting prey.

Sixteen-year-old high school student Shinichi Izumi falls victim to one of these parasites, but it fails to take over his brain, ending up in his right hand instead. Unable to relocate, the parasite, now named Migi, has no choice but to rely on Shinichi in order to stay alive. Thus, the pair is forced into an uneasy coexistence and must defend themselves from hostile parasites that hope to eradicate this new threat to their species.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.4,8,158,40,1263719,26745,"                              I'm the type of anime watcher that likes to wait for the anime to be completed before watching it; so I can either marathon it in one day or finish it in a few days - am I the only one who does this? Parasyte or Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu was one of those anime I've completed in a day. With the cliffhangers that leave you at the edge of your seat at the end of the episodes, to the humans that can morph into blades and mold their faces/ bodies for creating massacres; it's the perfect formula for binge watching. I would have been          
                              You’ve probably heard of them in classic sci-fi stories before; the very idea of alien creatures who can snatch bodies to impersonate a human and walk among our society. Build on the foundation of a science fiction and body horror, Kiseijuu (also known as Parasyte) takes a full swing with its premise. It’s simple actually. We have a case of alien invasion by mysterious beings who can infect us through parasitic means. By inserting themselves into a human’s brain, the parasites can take full control and transform you into a monster. Not only does this kill the victim but now it can even add more          
                              Based off of the award winning manga series written by Iwaaki Hitoshi, coming from the highly praised Madhouse studio, with all excitement and intense story, Kiseijuu constantly finished this season with its fineness.
                              If Tokyo Ghoul is fast food then Parasyte is fine dining.
                              I remember hearing a lot of hype for Parasyte when it was first announced for an anime adaptation. Apparently, it was a really popular manga in the 90s about some kid who got his hand infected by an alien parasite – hence the name I suppose, although I’m not sure why the “i” was changed into a “y” – and must now learn to live with it whilst warding off other similar infected people who had the misfortune of being killed by these beings before having their entire existence taken over. Seemed like good body horror stuff as is, but then came the influx of          
                              (This has been adapted from my reddit thread)
                              With a show like this, it's easy to see how much time and care has gone into making it succeed. Kiseijuu has so many genres and elements to it, however rather than it becoming a huge mess, it executes every single one perfectly. 
                              What makes a human? What makes a monster? Each of us have a bit of both in us, and it's up to you which one you want to be.

                              Me: Whats a parasite? Where do they come from?
                              Parasyte the Maxim is a story that handles questions about what makes us human, taking us on an unforgettable horror-adventure in the process.
                              There could not have been a more fitting end. Shinichi and Migi's dream in the final episode, along with the internal monologue life preaching that followed immediately after (consisting of HALF the sodding episode!), aptly summarised everything wrong with an anime that may as well have been titled 'Parasyte: Maximum Chatter Within'. It was telling that, with the chance to have AN ACTUAL CONVERSATION outside of Shinichi's head, instead the last exchange between the two characters played out internally. Migi said it was because he (genderless, but forever a bro) wanted Shinichi to forget. And I most certainly agreed with Migi's sentiment. 
                                    There are a few categories of anime that tend to gain mass appeal simply because of what they are. Examples include run-of-the-mill Shounens, Key adaptations, “Oh no I’m trapped in a video game!!” series, and action-horror anime that are filled with gore for good measure. Due to the recent disaster known as Tokyo Ghoul, I initially brushed Parasyte to the side dismissing it as another horror clone. For the first 12 episodes or so, I held my pinky in the air and avoided Parasyte like the plague. However, I finally caved to the hype. After marathoning the first half          
                              When this anime was airing, I had over 10 different animes that I was watching, and during that time this anime was my most favorite one. Even for a harem genre lover such as myself, I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy it as I watched despite the lack of nosebleeds.
                              Parasyte, a really hyped about anime when it started airing. Is the hype worth it? or is it just another exaggerated anime? I can't say. But as far as my biased opinion about this anime is concerned, I think this is a pretty good anime as far as story, setting and a new idea is concerned. Horror, there isn't much of it, just some people getting sliced up.",144

As preparations begin, genius setter Tobio Kageyama is invited to the All-Japan Youth Training Camp to play alongside fellow nationally recognized players. Meanwhile, Kei Tsukishima is invited to a special rookie training camp for first-years within the Miyagi Prefecture. Not receiving any invitations himself, the enthusiastic Shouyou Hinata feels left behind.

However, Hinata does not back down. Transforming his frustration into self-motivation, he boldly decides to sneak himself into the same rookie training camp as Tsukishima. Even though Hinata only lands himself a job as the ball boy, he comes to see this as a golden opportunity. He begins to not only reflect on his skills as a volleyball player but also analyze the plethora of information available on the court and how he can apply it.

As the much-anticipated national tournament approaches, the members of Karasuno's volleyball team attempt to overcome their weak points and refine their skills, all while aiming for the top!

                              Perhaps this is selfish, as I don’t interact with the community enough to know if this opinion is shared, but to me, the enduring appeal of seasons one through three of Haikyuu!!—putting aside, for now, its outstandingly high quality production—was in the fact it was the first and only shounen anime which did not feel like it was meant to go on forever. All shounen manga as serialized in Weekly Shounen Jump are literally, in-the-text, meant to go on forever. By design of the publication, volume sales and product sales are of secondary importance to by-vote audience reception, which would honestly be kind of cool          
                              Welcome to a new chapter of “I could never have imagined a volleyball anime could be this good”
                              Haikyuu is still as amazing as ever.
                              Yo. So far I’ve written reviews for every season of Haikyuu! and figured I’d keep it going. Most of the times I have been critical, but it’s been hard for me to figure out why I haven’t liked Haikyuu without saying “I just think it’s overrated”. I think this time I actually know why: It tries way too hard. 
                              To start off this review, I'd like to say that I've seen quite a few people complaining about this season. The main complaints seem to be about the animation and the lack of action.
                              Hot damn, it's back, baby! I gotta say, I found myself staying up-to-date with the manga, so I can't really talk much in this review about the story content because, well, I already knew what it would be; that being said, I'm still really excited to review this season of Haikyuu!! now that it's finally been animated. 
                              OKAY.... this season was amazingggg!!!! As a haikyuu fan that only watches the anime and not the manga, i was very excited to watch this season when it fully finished airing. Honestly, with the previous seasons i always thought that Hinata wasn't as good as I wanted him to be. He may have fast reflexes and at moments he may surprise you but his basic skills were not there. In this season, it mainly focuses on the character development of Hinata. There weren't many volleyball matches( there is a continuation of season 4 that will have nationals though c:), but I truly loved seeing him          
                              *Minimum Spoiler Review*
                              Haikyuu is my favorite sports anime. [haven’t watched hajime no ippo yet]
                              Preface: the review will likely be long and have a lot of grammar mistakes. Proofreading is too boring, so forgive me for that. Anyway, onto the review.
                              I will keep it short. I enjoyed this season, while they lack some elements from first one they improved others. It may be not tense as 3rd but games are still fun to watch.
                              The fourth season of Haikyuu. Story-wise, there are nothing really major this season. I like to think that this season is the part where they focus on character development, we get to see a lot of character development stories this season. This season is sort of a build-up to the main story in Part 2 later.
                              I gave this an overall 6/10. I really liked season's 1-3, it had a great story, intro music and the characters were great. However season 4 'to the top' wasn't great, I didn't like the change in art style as it seemed incomplete almost, 1 of the games took up 90% of the season and I wasn't satisfied about how the season ended. It was mediocre and the only reason I watched it was because of the story, other than that there was no enjoyment for me. Although I do recommend watching the other seasons. Overall it wasn't great and I didn't think it lived          
                              It'd be hard no matter what happened to follow up the adrenaline rush of the Shiratorizawa match. This season continues to develop the dynamics between the teammates and those they practice with, and Hinata continues to be a compelling character you just wanna cheer on. Other characters that sort of went by the wayside previously are also given some development and setup for later development (potentially). Speaking of, romance is typically played off as a joke in shounen, so it'd be interesting to see it go somewhere other than a punchline. Outside of that, a significant portion of this season didn't so much feel as          ",147

                              Overall I do rate this an 8 which is pretty high by my standards
                              Story - 10/10
                              Kingdom could really be described as one of those Anime’s that nearly reached perfection but lacked an element or two un-allowing it to do so. I absolutely loved everything about Kingdom; however you do have to make it past the first 12 episodes or so to get to the real action. Note: I don’t know anything about China’s history so I won’t be talking about the history element of this Anime in the review.
                              Kingdom 2nd Season (Dub) Review
                              Intro: This 2nd season is both better and worse than season 1, but overall it is weaker.
                              Overall 1 because im bad at maths
                              Kingdom is it's own title all about war, to the social hierarchy of peasants to nobles and to the middle it's generals it so great personalities. Not at all for Xin who had an intelligent friend and then a King who becomes his friend but he seems not to grow up and still doesn't present a bit of calmness of assertiveness, still it 2 intelligent friends. Not enough for his lack of CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT, he observes battles, has seem what a general is; leader and strategic but Xin is only angry and angry and was no experience for what he was gone through it Wang          
                              Kingdom's manga is my favourite ongoing manga lately but it's anime adaptation is almost a complete fail. Don't let yourself fooled by it's high rating! ",148

It is a rare disease which only affects teenagers, and its symptoms are so supernatural that hardly anyone recognizes it as a legitimate occurrence. However, high school student Sakuta Azusagawa knows from personal experience that it is very much real, and happens to be quite prevalent in his school.

Mai Sakurajima is a third-year high school student who gained fame in her youth as a child actress, but recently halted her promising career for reasons unknown to the public. With an air of unapproachability, she is well known throughout the school, but none dare interact with her—that is until Sakuta sees her wandering the library in a bunny girl costume. Despite the getup, no one seems to notice her, and after confronting her, he realizes that she is another victim of Puberty Syndrome. As Sakuta tries to help Mai through her predicament, his actions bring him into contact with more girls afflicted with the elusive disease.

                              What do I think about Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai? It’s an amazing show. That’s the simple way to say it but the complicated way is explaining it from my perspective. To be fair, I think this anime gets judged based on a lot of facts before it even aired. Like for instance, the brainchild behind the light novels is the same person that made Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo. (The Pet girl of Sakurasou) Anyone who has seen that anime may think what to expect from this show. But I think a bit differently. Hajime Kamoshida helmed the

                              The challenges we face during our adolescence may be irrelevant in the grand scheme of things, though their magnitude in the moment can feel overwhelming. It's no surprise then that media which intensifies these issues through supernatural phenomenon would be popular, since teenage audiences feel as if the weight of their problems is understood. However, does this media actually help its audience to overcome their problems, or is it merely wish fulfillment to escape from them? Seishun Buta Yarou may have something compelling to say about the adolescent experience, but it's unfortunately buried under layers of tropes and cliches.
                              The fall 18 anime season was great. Compare to the unfortunate lacklustre Summer 18 anime season it was the season that gave us back to back great titles that I consider anime of the year material such as theses following anime.

                              I consider myself diverse in what i have watched in my anime life. This, is simply amazing.
                              This is my first review and as such won't be as refined but some things I'd like to point out about this show. I liked it.
                              Wow. Now that it's over, I've got a lot to talk about. This show was one of the best ones to air this year, and it's got a lot to back it up. Everything from the opening to the character arcs shows that there was a lot of care and effort put into this show.

                              Im sure theres  a lot of high school romance anime's out there and most of them have the same old generic plot, but to me this anime articulacy stood out a lot over the rest of the stuff that was airing, there were other romance anime too but this was something else.

                              From the same creator of the ever calm ""Natsume Yuujinchou"" series comes ""Hotarubi no Mori e,"" a tale of the developing friendship between a young girl, Hotaru, and her youkai companion, Gin. Through brief glimpses at their time spent together once a year in the summer, viewers witness the passage of time and the changing of seasons, and the growing bonds that develop as the young girl grows up, while her youkai companion remains relatively the same. Even though this difference in age is negligible in her younger days, it becomes an increasing problem as she grows older. 
                              From the same mangaka that wrote Natsume Yuujinchou, being adapted by the same animation studio that brought you Natsume Yuujinchou, directed by the same man who directed Natsume Yuujinchou. Would you believe then, that this is nothing like Natsume Yuujinchou? That it is, in fact, a rip-roaring action-packed adventure flick as the main characters ride wave after wave of explosions and cynical social satire? Of course you wouldn't believe it because you're not gullible. This is just Natsume Yuujinchou the Rather Short Movie.

                              Hotarubi no Mori e is a relatively short movie that attempts to portray the developing relationship between a young girl and a spirit who stumbles upon said young girl in a forest.
                              I have no words to describe this anime. To me, this anime is nothing short of perfection. This movie cements anime  as a legitmate form of art in my opinion.
                              Want forty-four minutes of sadness and happiness mixed into a ball just for you?
                              So much to say about that one great first love. Since time immemorial, first love has always filled our hearts with longing and nostalgia and that is where Hotarubi no Mori e hits home.
                               I heard a lot about Hotarubi no Mori e for its great story, despite it being so short (45 minutes). It was a movie that people deemed was almost equal to others like 5 Centimeters per Second. I finally watched it after my friend pushed and pushed me to see it and I was definitely not disappointed. 
                              There is a metaphor that speaks of two parallel lines that have many in common but never meet...but there is another that really graced this movie dearly.
                              9/10
                              I stumbled upon this anime by pure coincidence while I was searching for something similar to Mushishi. Since it had only one episode, I thought to myself: I will give it a go. Needless to say, I was not dissapointed. It is truly great, but extremely sad. I cried like a baby during the last 10-15 minutes. Seriously, it is devastating. From my point of view at least. It is about love that can never become reality because even the slightest touch by a human will make him disappear. The story is simple, the characters are well thought out, but it is really so sad.

                              It's becoming more apparent to me by each passing season that if an anime gets any sort of recognition like this, it's bound to divide the community into 2 groups. The majority goes on to ride the hype train and hype the series in question up to the high heavens, while the other hops onto the hate train and then the shit-fest begins. I usually see myself not siding with any of these but frankly, the latter seems more reasonable to me than it ever was. I'll try to offer an unbiased opinion on this even though seeing its rating is kinda baffling. So let's          
                              [Disclaimer: The arguments I've made for story structure and such I'd probably still stand by. However, events of the plot I didn't judge necessary to address when I first wrote this review I can't say if I'd defend now. I made the choice to let the review as it stands and make no further edits.]
                              With any established community there are traditions that take fruition from within it. And when it comes to the anime community that tradition can be seen with the ritualistic assignment of labels that is accompanied with every new seasonal lineup. Each season's catalog is cherry-picked through by the ascending masses to be filed away in neat little categories that're decided by whatever the common consensus is at that time. And it's thanks to this unspoken system that we get our ""anime of the season,"" ""hidden gems"" and ""BURN WITH FIRE"" shows that, for the most part, seems to be what the general audience agree upon.          
                              So I've just finished this anime and if you're wondering if it's worth watching, I will tell you it truly is. A great masterpiece that keep me wanting more. The characters aren't too overwhelming or annoying and the pacing is nice. The story line is great also. 
                              Ever felt like you made a big mistake in life and wanted to fix it? Or perhaps you just want things to go in the right direction if given another chance? Most people will never get that sort of opportunity. But for a guy named Satoru Fujinuma, that’s another story. His ability, Revival is pretty much a gift that allows him to travel back in time with his memories. So in essence, the guy can basically fix mistakes in his life with a second opportunity. Actually, I should probably rephrase that. What he has isn’t just a gift but also a responsibility. The ability to          
                              Well, I've almost watched all anime masterpieces and undoubtedly, this is one of them. I've never written a review before, but now I do, because this anime really earned it.

                              Ambition is the elixir of creation. It is that which gives spirit to its container, and those rare gems that rise above their standardized, rehashed counterparts are almost always backed by the unadulterated ambition of their creator(s). And ambition rests on the shoulders of ideas. The notion of ideas and ambition being interlocked is an unspoken truth - a virtuous tenet of great works. However, there is something more; something that too often gets overlooked, and when untended, sets both ambition and the idea that bore it on route for inevitable disaster. That ‘something’ is focus. An idea – no matter how great or innovative          
                              Boku dake ga Inai Machi (ERASED) is an anime that capitalizes on emotional appeal. It incorporates plot devices that primarily targets the audience’s pathos and on a surface level achieves this very effectively. Unfortunately, these same plot devices are only contrived for the sole purpose of making the audience have the so-called “feels.” From a more logical perspective, they do not make any sense, and because of this, we are left with an inconsistent plotline that is riddled with flaws.
                              It was a cold, uncompromising winter in the early weeks of 2016 but thankfully a new anime had heralded its arrival with a promise warm the world’s hearts. People braved the blizzard of mediocrity to find that one show that could rise to the top and be the ray of sunshine they craved. Boku dake ga Inai Machi (Or known by its English title ‘Erased’) waved its hand high and proud, promising a touching tale of one man’s journey to fix both the past and the present. The show did indeed have a certain glow about it that appealed to me but it’s sad to          
                              Hype can be a fickle thing when it comes to seasonal anime. At first it allows fans to get excited and anxious for the next episode, but majority of the time it ends up with many feeling somewhat disappointed with what they had been watching. This can be attributed to the fact that only one episode is released per week, and this week-long wait between episodes is a breeding ground for die-hard fans to praise a show as one of the best anime after only having seen a couple episodes. You only have to see the ‘Top Anime List’ on MAL to see that whenever

                              For those reading this review w/o finishing the first season will be spoiled so be forewarned
                              Continuing a beloved series and making it greater or just as great can be a challenging task to take. This is not much of a problem for anime that are step-by-step adaptations of any type of original source medium. Spice and Wolf, if you don’t know, is one series that won me over from the previous season. Likewise, I was hoping that this 2nd season would have the same positive impact that the 1st season did for me. While it is not better than the first season in many aspects, it definitely possessed the same fascinating qualities that the 1st season had, with a few          
                                 First of all, I must say this is my 1 review, so I lack of experience, and my English is not the best, but here are my appointments.
                              *This is a non-spoiler review of both seasons of Spice and Wolf
                              Vulnerability is the essence of romance. It's the art of being uncalculated, the willingness to look foolish, the courage to say, 'This is me, and I'm interested in you enough to show you my flaws with the hope that you may embrace me for all that I am but, more important, all that I am not.'
                              (This has been adapted from my reddit thread)
                              Of Spice and Wolf season 2 is a disappointment in almost every sense of the word. It is slightly worse in every aspect than the first season, and the first season wasn’t even that good. 
                              After an epic final in the first season which left me stunned. I was expecting the second season to slow down and turn more romantic. Found out i am right, but the mercantile stuff is still going strong and there is even a merchant duel on par with death note quality. Backstabbing and market values etc. It all returns in its great glory!
                              I just need to preface this review with the fact that I have an intense love in my heart for analytical, deep thinking and outside of the box ""anything"". I had such, such high hopes for this show. I mean, I poured through the reviews, and I was so freaking PUMPED. I was that kid who was obsessed with games on building, trading...empires...history... By the end of the 2nd season I was just F***** PISSED. The first season was sheer dent of will...this was a crucibal. 
                              Compared to the first season i was very disappointed. I was hoping for a second season that flowed the same as the first season and it simply did not. I wont go into too much detail but literally half of the season they are in one town, just one town! And just trying to make one deal! 
                              This is the first review I have ever written on anime, however, that is only testament to the fact that I have never been so moved by one. Spice and Wolf's greatness stems from the fact that they do not pander to the lowest common denominator. Spice and Wolf does not intend to be an extremely popular anime, what it intends to, and succeeds in doing is being the very best anime for a niche audience. 
                              Well, im simply saying this to strengthen my next sentence, but i have watched nearly 500 anime series... And this is by far the best romance anime among them and one of the best among all genres. Even though the Light Novels ended and even fully translated by now, they should animate all of Light Novels,not for the profit from it or to advertise Light Novels, but to leave an example of pinnacle for all japanese animation made from Light Novels and the pinnacle for Light Novels alike. It would not be far fetched to say that this is the pinnacle of them all, by          
                              Fuck that beautiful just beautiful end, this anime pretty surprised me ah never thought an anime of 2009 in terms of Animation, ambience and soundtrack far exceed Anime Anime 2014 This was just a masterpiece with very uan style ambience of the time where cities bestimentas funds occurs, all very style of the time, the plot is just very well thought makes me think the phrase ""are pure business"" and again, the characters are also maravollosos (protruding Horo) the more secondary side may have a past or a story that makes you get more desire to know (A what Space Dandy), the animation is exemplary          
                              Everything that was wonderful about the first season continues on during this second part of the Spice and Wolf saga.",160

Sentarou's immeasurable love for jazz music inspires Kaoru to learn more about the genre, and as a result, he slowly starts to break out of his shell, making his very first friend. Kaoru begins playing the piano at after-school jazz sessions, located in the basement of fellow student Ritsuko Mukae's family-owned record shop. As he discovers the immense joy of using his musical talents to bring enjoyment to himself and others, Kaoru's summer might just crescendo into one that he will remember forever.

Sakamichi no Apollon is a heartwarming story of friendship, music, and love that follows three unique individuals brought together by their mutual appreciation for jazz.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.36,8,176,497,286856,5941,"                              I love jazz. Some of my favorite memories of my time living in Florida have to be going downtown to listen to the local jazz festival. Sitting in front of that gazebo and getting into the spirit of the musicians is something you can only experience if you listen to jazz. It’s so different from any other musical genre and I was excited as hell to get to watch an anime centered around this amazing style of music.
                              First of all, I must say it's been a while since I've enjoyed a series as much as I enjoyed Sakamichi no Apollon.
                              Treasure your Friends, Unlike Love Affairs, Friendship is for Life.
                              Sakamichi no Apollon is a school drama from 2012. The original manga was written by Kodama Yuki. The anime version was brought to us by MAPPA & Tezuka, neither of which I've seen a lot from. I don't know what to expect from this one at all. So, let's just get right into it. 
                              As someone who hasn't good much background on both Jazz music and Japan during the 1960s, I was wary of watching it at first.
                              Do you like jazz? Would you like to see a show where jazz is the focus? Where the characters have fun playing some good ol' jazz pieces with each other and talking about jazz pieces? Then this anime is NOT for you. Do you like normal cliché romance with poorly constructed drama with a far too fast and disappointing ending? Then this anime is for you!
                              Are you ready for a bromance so strong, you’ll feel friendship tingles down the shaft of your peen? For romance elements so complex, they are no longer love triangles--but instead, terrifying, ever-growing love polygons of doom? For jam sessions so boppin’ they could make the late, great, Sun Ra tap his foot in his grave? Then my friend, you are prepared for Kids on the Slope.
                              The story consists of a lot of romance tropes, and really tends to play up it's character drama. I didn't enjoy the romance stuff very much, but I feel like the show worked remarkably well in portraying the tension of the relationship between characters through music. When the characters are playing music together, you really can feel their emotions come through, and I thought that was really impressive. The characters, and their interactions with each other were really the best part of the story, despite the otherwise pretty boilerplate storyline.
                              This was an anime that popped up in my recommendations for a while based off various other's I watched.  I simply didn't believe it would be anything close to what I wanted and became frustrated seeing the same cover page over and over of which I wasn't to fond of.  I refused to watch it time and time again based on my own superficial reasons until I finally said to myself ""it's 20 minutes of my life, I'll watch just one episode.""  It wasn't just 20 minutes, it ended up being a good portion of the season before I had to finally          
                              This is my first time writing a review here and I tried my hardest to leave out any real spoilers. So, here we go:
                              Once again we are encountering a great anime. Kids on the slope is another combo between Shinichiro Watanabe and Yoko Kanno. I can't imagine now if someone else did a screen version of Kids on the slope. But lets get to the point.
                              It’s not gay if it’s a three way.  
                              How much you enjoy Sakamichi no Apollon is largely dependent on your level of emotional maturity.
                              Set in 1966, Sakamichi no Apollon is centered on Kaoru Nishimi as he moves to Sasebo to live with relatives due to his father’s job. Naturally, he’s a loner, a great student, and completely isolated from people since he’s always been moving around; he doesn't try to get attached to people in case he must leave them again. But there’s something in the air in Sasebo, and it’s not just love or friendship, it’s a new sound (to Japan at least) known as jazz. Music isn't new to Kaoru as he’s a classically trained pianist, but jazz is certainly new and interesting to him, as          
                              When anime fans see the name Shinichiro Watanabe attached to an anime they usually get excited due to his excellent work making Cowboy Bebop. So going into Sakamichi no Apollon there is a certain expectation given to the show. Unlike Watanabe's previous animes, this one does not have any action in it at all. Instead, the focus is on romance and drama.",161

Since I consider anime, as a genre, to be just as legitimate an art form (despite the bad rep it often gets), I will also review Bakemonogatari as a work of art, and it is irrefutably one of the special few anime series that fully capitalize on the strengths of the anime medium.

                              ""Did you know every time you sigh, a little bit of happiness escapes?"" - Senjougahara Hitagi, Episode 6
                              This anime seemed to have a lot of mysteries in it, but the biggest mystery it presented to me was why I took such a violent dislike to it even though it has been favorably discussed by intelligent viewers. I stopped watching it early on, out of simple irritation. To me it was marching straight down that wrong road we are warned against in the aphorism, ""Don't gild the lily."" 
                              **SPOILER FREE REVIEW**
                              It is very rare to see such a successful marriage of a director’s vision and an author’s material. Bakemonogatari’s existence is an anomaly especially in present day where adaptations are subpar when compared to the source. However, there has never been a more potent combination than Nisio Isin and Studio SHAFT’s Akiyuki Shinbou. Shinbou’s quirky, and imaginative art direction greatly compliments the fast paced dialogue and witticisms that Nisio is known for. The end result is a tour de force of both visuals and prose. Bakemonogatari is a meticulously crafted tale that never ceases to maintain the viewer’s attention and titillate the imagination.
                              Author's note: Please don't take this review too seriously. This is merely describing my own painful experience with this show. I'm not personally attacking Monogatari fans! Thank you.
                              Finally giving in to the hype, I picked up Bakemonogatari, the most discussed anime of '09, on the very first day of this year. The show's appeal was lost on me during the first few episodes, but after a while the reasons for this anime's charm on so many became apparent. As to whether that charm worked on me as well, that's something I'm going to explain a bit more thoroughly further on.
                              Some people says that Bakemonogatari is a milestone in the anime history. That's correct, because before the appearance of this one, the anime industry doesn't know what the ultimate shit is. And now it knows, all of us knows right now. The standard of ugliness, standard of boredom, standard of tastelessness, standard of potboiler, national team of all shounen's cliches, the lowest mark on the scale of the quality from now on has a material incarnation - Bakemonogatari. So it's, no doubt, a great milestone in anime history.

                              'People save themselves on their own. Nobody can ever save anyone else'
                              For starters, this is more of an analysis than a review and is intended for those who have already seen Bakemonogatari.
                              Filled with gorgeous shots of underaged women, inventive fourth-wall breaks, and highly detailed PowerPoint slides, Bakemonogatari single-handedly redefined what it meant to be a pretentious anime at the time of its release in a way that no anime since has been able to capture the essence of. It is an incredible feat that a harem anime manages to get across so little humor and emotion with so much ostensible effort. Perhaps if I was steeped in Japanese culture, I would understand that the tsundere girl talking to the viewer about being tsundere was actually a post-ironic meta-commentary reference about the overabundance of meaningless fourth wall

To achieve fame, fortune, love, or maybe even revenge.  Some are simple and others ambitious beyond belief.  The real question is, do you have the will to fulfill that dream?  Is it truly what you wish for? Are willing to struggle to the end for it? Many people try to fulfill their aspirations. Many people simply die in regret and are forgotten.  Others fulfill a dream so large they are remembered for all time.          
                              Katanagatari is interesting because it's one of the better anime in recent time (that I have seen), one of the best anime from 2010 (that I have seen) and arguably the best work of NisiOisiN (that I have seen, even though this only includes two titles).
                              What is it that you fight for? Money? Power? Honor? Love? Revenge? Out of all the millions of reasons , in the end does it really matter? These are some of the things you will ponder while watching Katanagatari. Nisio Isin, the mind behind the monogatari-series, which some might call a twist on the harem genre, has used his deft hand at creating unique characters and worlds, in what would traditionally be a shounen premise. The end result, is a masterfully crafted tale that blends Japanese folklore, romance, and martial arts with a very contemporary touch that makes Katanagatari feel both modern and old at          
                              Katanagatari started as a light novel series by Isin Nisio. Who's written nothing else that I'm familiar with. He wrote some novelizations for both Death Note and xxxHolic, but I'm only familiar with the originals for those two and novels based on established series tend to vary a lot in quality. The anime adaptation was handled by the relatively new White Fox studio. They were behind both the Jormungand and Steins;Gate anime, so that could be a good sign. Then again, every studio tends to do some good and some bad work so this could be the first anime they've done that I dislike. Only          
                              Considering the amount of love this show has received, it feels risky giving a comparatively low score to Katanagatari, although I don't personally consider a 7 by any means low. Please don't label this review as ""not helpful"" just because you disagree with the scores or think they are too low. This is a difficult show to review because a) most of my complaints are directed to the plot and character development, both of which are difficult to describe without spoilers, and b) some of the complaints can also be considered reasons why this show is amazing or unique. Unique is indeed one of the

                              I'm actually astounded by the huge number of people lauding Katanagatari as a masterpiece, with high rating of 9's and 10's popping off everywhere in the reviews, claiming that it is perfect/flawless blah blah blah,  listing everything positive about it then exaggerating it further. This makes it appear like it's 10/10 worthy solely from reviews when really, it's far from the truth. While Katanagatari isn't the worst out there which feels mentally violating or makes you want to smack your head against a brick wall or a sharp corner on your table, it is not on the same level as the masterpieces, which feels

                              Katanagatari: a tale of twelve twisted swords,
                              Katanagatari is an anime that I came to surprise, not to discredit, but the other animated works of Mr. Nisio Isin have seemed very mediocre, under this prejudiced thinking, I present myself before Katanagatari
                              You could pretty much summarize the whole plot of Katanagatari (sword story in English) by it's title. Because, it really is story about two people traveling around japan, collecting twelve magical swords. However, when you actually sit down and watch it, you will probably get more out of it than you had expected.

                              It would not be to much of a stretch to call this an Chinese attempt at a Studio Ghibli style animated story. All the little notes that one attributes to Ghibli are there. The vague, yet familiar story; the grandiose reveals of scenery; relatable yet other worldly characters; and a musical score that's both supportive of the art and at the same time having an immense presence of its own.",164

                              Prologue:
                              Kemono no Souja Erin: Destruction of Boundaries
                              While it may strike as inconsistent to rate a series a 3 when I ""finished"" 50 episodes of it, there is one essential reason, that is pacing of this series. Not only is the pacing typically slice-of-life slow from the very start, but it has the most self-indulgent use of flashback I have ever seen. By the midpoint of the anime, flashback starts taking up easily perhaps 1/10th of the total time. We already saw these events, and they are already in our heads. Bringing the same events up as much as five or ten times is a horrible abuse of our viewership. Maybe it          
                              Yep...the time has come. I've been gradually watching this series for about 3 months and now it's finally time to give my thoughts on it. This isn't going to be easy. On the one hand, I really love this series. I added it to my extended favorites without hesitation. The first 20 episodes are absolutely amazing! It's still the best anime adaptation of a YA novel that I've seen. I think it's quite a bit better than Moribito or Shinsekai Yori.
                              Nahoko Uehashi’s Kemono no Souja Erin is a “hidden gem” anime. While more people have seen/heard of Uehashi’s Seirei no Moribito, not nearly enough people have seen this beautiful series. I could babble about how much I love this series for hours, but, instead, I’ll try to tell you why (and why it’s 9/10 instead of 10/10!).
                              Kemono no Souja Erin is a good choice for you if you want to watch a series aimed for children that tries to build a fantasy world that has its own depth and use that to ingrain something into your moral fiber. However this immediately becomes a terrible choice if you can't handle its slow pace and its very poor choices in the sound department, which I'll get on later. And it's also an obviously terrible choice if you don't expect it to treat you like a dumb kid who needs flashbacks every few episodes to be remembered what happens and don't like being to          
                              ""Kemono no Souja Erin"" is an anime with great plot potential, well build characters and pleasant design, but unfortunately - horrid storytelling and structure. It takes 50 episodes to tell the story (which is supposed to be understandable, since it's long one), but dragged scenes with badly animated conversations, and lots of flashbacks make you feel as if it should be done in 26 episodes instead - and maybe it should have. 
                              Fantasy anime have long been characterized by an abundance of wicked sorcerers and cute cat girls, but Kemono no Souja Erin features none of these tropes, instead drawing on elements from classic fairy tales. Its innocuous artstyle, which mimics the illustrations of Aesop’s picture books, exhibits an aura foreign to most contemporary anime fans. Coupled with its unremarkable first episode, the show is easy to dismiss as a childish folktale not worth the trouble.
                              The first word that comes to mind after watching Kemono no Souja Erin is LIFE.  It is a story of a young girl growing up and finding her own pathway, as her mother asked her to do, to live and find happiness.  It has a series of ups, downs and everywhere in between.
                              I'm sure that most of you have heard of anime such as Naruto, Bleach, and Sword Art Online, but haven't heard of Beast Player Erin. Truly a shame which anime are becoming popular and which are becoming overlooked and forgotten these days. Beast Player Erin is a series that isn't nearly as popular as other modern shows, but it's one that once you know about it, you're going to want to watch it, then you're going to love it, then wish you had known about it before and then be overwhelmed by the urge to re-watch it; this was certainly the case for me.

                              Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin/機動戦士ガンダムTHE ORIGIN Review
                              PSA: This is a prequel; please watch AFTER you watch the original series
                              Like everyone else on MAL, I also enjoyed Gundam: The Origin. The CG looks great. The action set pieces are amazing. It's a series made by Gundam fans, for Gundam fans. In other words, this is fanservice done right. At the same time, I do feel it's become a tad overrated. A lot people are calling this the best Gundam series and it's really not. I might not receive many helpfuls for doing this, but I feel like I HAVE to say some of this or else I'll go insane.
                              Gundam Origin to me is close to being a perfect prequel. Before someone gets up in their arms about Origin technically coming from a manga that’s a full on retelling of the MGS 0079 story and therefore being more of a spin-off than a prequel, I think they decided to cut it off before the events of the TV show because that’s where some more noticeable deviations start. However prior to that it roots itself strongly in the material people already know with only minor deviations that in my opinion don’t undermine what it adds to the universe.
                              Before I get to the review, I'll have you know that I have not yet read the manga yet. I may have read it, but not when I wrote this review. 
                              Alright! This series was my introduction to Gundam, as recommended by many people. Before watching this I had no view or idea of what Gundam was and what was in store for me. I am happy to say I am overjoyed after watching this. The animation and everything was amazing and very enjoyable. I can say after viewing this OVA I am now a fan of Gundam. I am very impressed with the OVA's ability to capture the viewer, and make me go,"" Whoa!"" I found myself quickly becoming attached to the cast and caring about what happens next and what is planned to happen.          
                              You know, this franchise really likes to retell the story of the OYW. I’m serious, there are so many reimaginings, retellings and side stories that it’s ridiculous. Perhaps the most infamous one is Tomino’s MSG Novel Trilogy, which I’ll get around to reading at some point. The most famous for good reasons, however, has to be Gundam The Origin. A 24 Volume Manga by Yasuhiko Yoshikazu the retells the whole original series while adding a shit load of new content to it. While I have been planning to read it, lack of accessibility has prevented me from doing so; however I will read it as          
                              Welcome to my third review. After the first 2 I am finally giving a review to something outstanding. This review is about the ONA 'Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin'.
                              SS Review – Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin
                              Really shows the limitations of directly adapting a manga series, having all the best and worst moments thrown in together with no regard as to how it's going to play out in a new medium. Someday Japanese anime companies are going to realize that 100% faithfully adapting a comic into TV format doesn't actually always work, because one medium has sound and motion while the other has panel spacing and static imagery. Really, there were so many moments in these six Gundam: The Origin movies where they could have messed around with the pacing, or ignored the narration in favor of visual storytelling, or just          
                              [Edit] The only other Gundam that I gave the highest score was Iron-Blooded Orphans. Now I must give to Gundam: The Origin, too. As a Gundam fan, I watch everything Gundam-related, but few get the highest score. This is an outstanding OVA series, with an amazing story. I`ll tell you all about bellow, but I already warn you that you must be familiar with the Universal Century from Gundam, to get the full experience.
                              The Universal Century Gundam timeline has always had an air of Game of Thrones in space (or more accurately the other way around, since Tomino was doing this decades before Martin). Nowhere is this more clearly felt than in Gundam: The Origin. By setting the bulk of the story in a time of relative peace, we see the political machinations, plotting, and betrayals come to the fore. It's riveting stuff, sprawling across an interplanetary stage. While Casval/Edouard/Char/Quattro (seriously, how many names does this guy have?) is the main focus, plenty of time is spent fleshing out many other familiar faces from the One Year War.          
                              An amazing work of art, I want Gundam 0079 and Zeta Gundam rebooted in this style, with this quality, oh how I want the entire Gundam Origins manga brought into life like this.
                              Before I truly start with this review I must say that Char Aznable is one of my favorite characters in all of fiction and  before I watched the last two episodes, I was ready to tear this show to shreds because of it’s awful portrait of the Char Aznable character, fortunately the last two episodes were so good that the show went from a 4 to a 7.

                              Romeo's Blue Skies is one of the shorter and more recent additions to the collection of World Masterpiece Theatre series produced and animated by Nippon Animation. Once again it is an adaption of a work of literature originating from Europe, this time based on the novel ""Die schwarzen Brüder"" written by Lisa Tetzner.
                              Romeo no Aoi Sota is my favorite anime television show of all time (not just my favorite anime of all time) and there’s no quick answer to that. The main reason why I tell people to watch the show is because of the relaxing and simplistic atmosphere that the show has, but while saying that I think that I don’t do justice to my relationship with this show and taking into in consideration that I’ve dedicated most of my latest days to write about my favorite shows and the one I hate the most, I’ve decided to write another essay explaining in detail why I          
                              Romeo no Aoi Sora is, without a doubt, one of the most genuinely heartfelt shows I've had the pleasure to watch.
                              Now I've finished arguably one of the most accessible and most popular (just behind Daddy Long Legs) World Masterpiece Theater anime yet! I remember seeing the first episode of this long ago, but that was when the fansub group working on the remasters was working on Nobody's Boy Remi and Treasure Island. Once they got to working on it, I jumped at the opportunity to watch it. I liked it immensely, and I still do, but things often tried preventing me from watching it, like school, bad downloads, etc. But after a long while, I finally got to finish it, and I am proud of          
                              If you ask me what is this anime about and why the name mentions skies, I tell you this.
                              ""We'll always be together, no matter how far apart.""
                              this anime is one of the first series that I have ever watched (that was like 13 years ago) and is undeniably the first to made me cry like a brat kid in a department store (wasn't lying tho haha bc Alfred huhuhu)
                              Ill start by saying this,i consider myself lucky, to be one of the few people who successfully unearthed this treasure. Am not overrating this anime it simply deserves this. Nowadays almost all animes are based on supernatural powers aka things that would never encounter us in real life. Its sad to say, but people prefer those animes over things like Romeo no Aoi Sora. People completely forgot about even strong powers..... such as love, faithfulness, trust, hope, following ones dreams ,friendship and determination. All these elements and much more are all expressed in this anime thats why its one of a kind. Forgot to mention          
                              One of the reasons because i watch anime is the diversity of the stories. Some can be dramatic, romantic, comedic, etc. But some of theme are just beautiful. In terms of story, characters, the lesson that teaches when you watch it. Romeo no aoi sora is one of those.
                              I'm watching anime for more than 20 years. I'm a bit picky, which means that I tend to choose certain genres, art styles, plots and all that. Yet, I often watch anime of a kind that would appeal to much younger myself. ",170

It doesn't glorify it or portray animators as hyper-talented geniuses, and many of the characters in the show admit they do not even understand why they're working in the industry. But there's something that keeps them passionate about what they do, even if it may not be the most respected form of media out there. 
                              ~Multilingual review, English & Español: SHIROBAKO~
                              Out of curiosity, I've been thinking a lot about how anime are made, but it is fairly hard to get insights into the practices of this particular industry. And then, Shirobako came around.
                              I think it's common knowledge that two of the most important things in the world are doughnuts and anime. But when you combine those two things with well-written comedy, a plethora of memorable characters, and a realistic and interesting story, you receive something so great that it literally revives an entire genre of animation that has been becoming less and less creative as years go by. This mixture can be referred to as Shirobako, which can also go by the name of Watch This Show Because It Is Probably The Best Thing Ever. I'm not kidding. There's so much packed within the confines of this          
                              Every so often an anime comes around that, while certainly not perfect, fully deserves a 10/10 rating. There are anime which get their 10/10 rating by being masterful works which envelope your senses and bring you on an exciting journey - but then there are also anime which change your perception, and change the way you think about certain things, which make them equally deserving. Shirobako is the latter. When initially hearing about and watching the first few episodes of Shirobako I certainly expected to find it interesting and insightful, I never would have thought that it would change my perception on anime, and ultimately          
                              There are many ideas the average viewer thinks about when they are asked what makes an anime work for them. Is it the driving narrative that help to construct the pieces of the story? Is it the lovable cast of characters that help drive the story to its own path? Is it the breathless, but invigorating and vibrant animation that help to bring it to life? Is it the overall palatable visual design that help to give the show its identity? Is it the mesmerizing voice acting and sound direction that help to make it memorable?
                              Ever wanted to know how anime is made? The magic behind the scenes is always something I’m sure almost any anime fan would want to know. Shirobako opens up that curtain of magic as it brings together a show that discusses about making anime. It’s almost a dream like come true for anyone who has a fascination in the art of crafting anime. Thanks to P.A Works, that fascination can now become a reality.
                              'Bakuman' became a cult hit by giving manga fans a look inside the industry. If the manga about manga can do well, why not an anime about anime? Much like 'Bakuman', 'Shirobako' delivers a high level of enjoyment and information, but threadbare plot and character development keep it from being anything beyond a fun ride.
                              Shirobako is a good choice for you if you want to have a look into the anime industry but without events and characters seeming like they progress in a natural or realistic fashion, but still giving you somewhat of a decent insight into the industry regardless.
                              Shirobako is an anime about making anime. In this sense it feels very different to most shows you might have seen but different doesn't have to mean bad. At first I was a little sceptical about the show, after all, how exciting can an anime ABOUT anime be? Although at the same time, I was also a bit curious about what exactly would be in the show. If you've been watching anime for a while, then I really would recommend you take the chance, because the odds are that you won't regret it, it really helps you appreciate anime more. Even if you are relatively          
                              Have any of these questions ever passed through your mind while watching anime? “Why did that last anime you watch have a dodgy scene of animation in the last episode?” “Why did the animation style start to seem to slacken off as the show progressed?” “Why on earth did the show choose to not stay closer to the source material?” If so then Shirobako – the anime about making anime - can provide reasons for you delivered in an entertaining and memorable package. This labour of love from P.A. Works is one of my favourite shows I’ve been lucky enough to watch of late. It’s          
                              Shirobako is yet another series I watched on a whim and which ended up surprising me in a very good way.
                              We all love anime. Otherwise we wouldn't be on this site.

                              It's very rare when you get something that is so simple, but yet so powerful. Shelter really reminds me why I love anime. It gives us such unique and fantastic experiences that's hard to find anywhere else.
                              Shelter tells the story about a girl that comes to realize the situation that she is in, and how it affects her. The story details the ways in which her life played out before an ""incident"" and the aftermath of it. A really well produced and powerful piece of art that really tells a nice story. The only thing that hampers the work is its incredibly short length, although I also think that that is one of its strong suits. Very touching, and very well thought out. If this could be turned into a full project I would absolutely watch more. There is definitely potential          
                              Shelter is, basically, a condensate of every single element of tear-jerk shows, sad videos and others things like this.
                              Shelter is most beautiful thing I have ever seen in my life but it is not an anime. 
                              ""Shelter"" is the music video/""short film"" for the Porter Robinson and Madeon collaborative EDM track of the same name. Many media outlets were excitedly sharing the news of this groundbreaking piece of media, a western musician and a Japanese animation studio working together to create something (a concept people seem to forget is not new at all). I was initially excited too, being a fan of Porter Robinson's music. However, once I actually watched it, my hype slowly drained away and he obvious truths of the situation set in.
                              I wasnt expecting much from a 6 minute anime, Ive been dissapointed in the past, but this time i was proved wrong.
                              Holy hell. I've read many different opinions about this MV now and let me just get this out of the way. It's not as good as Porter fans/ anime connoisseur make it out to be, and it's by far not as bad as some anti-mainstream hipsters say. People that give this piece everything under 5 are either lying to make themselves fell better and/or stand out or they just have not watched enough shows to even know what truly awful feels like. I saw that some people gave this piece a 1 for incredible exaggerated reasons. It's a fucking music video. It's 6 minutes long.          
                              I have never written a review before, and I never planned on doing such on this site, but I have to make an exception for Shelter. In my opinion, Shelter is a showcase of what so many anime are missing, complied in 6 minutes of compact emotions. Obviously, given the length of the video, there is not a whole lot of room for dialogue, character development, or story in general. However, Shelter manages to touch on each just enough to invoke the feelings of sympathy and empathy for the MC.
                              Shelter is a music video. It's nothing less, and nothing more.
                              Wow, so I see that a lot of cynicism managed to reach top reviews on MAL.
                              It's quite hard to review music videos, and in this case it's anime related and went viral instantly. Leading all the masses to watch it since It's only 6 minutes long. 
                              Shelter is a short six minute music video produced by A-1 Pictures that has been gaining a lot of positive reviews lately and I can't pinpoint why exactly. Sure the music video looks fantastic from an animation perspective with great background work, fantastic art and design coupled with great animation and flow. I liked the final message of how it is important to move on with your life and felt it was a strong idea to leave out on. The song itself is okay, but this boils down more so to personal preference than an actual critique of this short video.
                              This is the first time that I have ever seen an anime video with duration less than 7 mins,yet my feelings have been spilled out throughout my heart.
                              Although it is far from perfect, ""Shelter"" is a well-done anime music video that manages to deliver some thoughtful moments to the audience. In its short timespan, it manages to deliver a memorable story that compliments the music of Porter Robinson and Madeon. Fans of anime and the two electronic music artists will undoubtedly find ""Shelter"" worthy of their time.",174
175,"A few months after the events of Steins;Gate, Rintarou Okabe and his group of friends are invited to tag along with their acquaintance Faris NyanNyan, who is participating in a Rai-Net battle event in the United States. There, they meet up with an old colleague: Kurisu Makise, who has been recalling fragmented memories of events that happened in the other world lines in the form of dreams. She confronts Okabe, questioning him as to whether these events—particularly the incidents between the two of them—did indeed happen.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.34,8,190,406,340713,793,"                              I am a huge fan of the Steins;Gate series, but this is a really unnecessary addition which has nothing to say.
                              Steins;Gate is still one of my favorite series of all time because it makes you cry, laugh and feel something you've never felt before. In the time I finished steins;gate series, I decided to watch this.
                              After marathoning the whole TV series I could not resist watching its sequel, this OVA, Oukoubakku no Poriomania (or in English, Egoistic Poriomania) right away - and I was not disappointed at all. It is just as beautiful as its prequel, and I am talking about the final scene. It was not serious, but it would be redundant anyway. Feiris has to go to America and invites her friends - the laboratory members. They visit Kurisu, but she lost her memories about the other world lines, but her life in the other world lines always appears in her dreams. The kiss scene in episode 22          
                              NNNOOOOOOSSTTTALGIAAAAAAAAAA DRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYBU~
                              I remember when I finished Steins;Gate. I was left yearning for more, that last speck of satisfaction and glowing epicness that just made me.....feel perfect. But knowing that Steins;Gate was so epic, I didn't want it to go on, simply because sequels usually, quite frankly, suck. But then again, this wasn't a Hollywood movie; no, that's because it was so much more. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you: Steins;Gate, tying up loose ends.
                              Let's get one thing straight here, this extra episode does not ""tie up loose ends."" It's simply an episode premiering Suzuha's mom, and reinforcing that yes, now Okabe and Makise are ""together"" again. Other than that, it is just a comedic relief episode, with almost no real content in it. It's not terrible by any means really, if you liked the series then yes, you will like this added episode, but this was not even close to needed.
                              Personally, I started watching Steins;Gate because of its plot which involves time travel time paradoxes, and etc. The problem with this special episode is that it contains little to no ""essence"" of what Steins;Gate really was all about.
                              “It's time to say goodbye, but I think goodbyes are sad and I'd much rather say hello.”
                              Oh the memories that this brings back...
                              Eagerly anticipating a sequel after a month having watched Steins;Gate, I was pleasantly blessed with an OVA special. 
                              It's just a special bonus episode, but... ***WARNING: SPOILERS*** anyways.
                              Steins;Gate: Oukoubakko no Poriomania is exactly what you would expect from an epilogue episode. It picks up sometime after the series ended to show what become of the characters. Because of this it is not particularly watchable if you haven't seen the series but then again it is not intended to be. 
                               Tutturu...!!
                              If you are not a fan of Steins;Gate, then you will not enjoy this special episode. But if you are a fan, this is a good conclusion episode. It answered a lot of open questions that the main TV series left us, and gave a better picture of what's going to happen in the world line called Steins;Gate. 
                              This Steins;Gate special delivers about as ideally as you would expect from a Steins;Gate special. It looks and feels exactly like you'd expect it to, and it tackles some very relevant plot points. It's like a ribbon that nicely ties in some questions left over from the main series. ",175

Among a stone world of statues, Taiju encounters one other living human: his science-loving friend Senkuu, who has been active for a few months.

Taiju's brawn and Senkuu's brains combine to forge a formidable partnership, and they soon uncover a method to revive those petrified.

                              Having been a fan of Weekly Shonen Jump works for many years, their arsenal of genres continues to bring diversity to its audience. From ninjas in hidden villages to mages from magical guilds, it seems once in a while, there comes a new hot topic for fans to celebrate. Dr. Stone celebrates a post-apocalyptic adventure that serves as a love letter to science but also brings a refreshing look to its fans.
                              If Dr. Stone was a human being, it would be that one really annoying and narcissistic kid in class that thinks he knows everything about whatever sh*t and cr*p, but in reality, is just a whiny little p*ssy that nobody respects. I wish I could say that this analogy is 100% accurate, however, that is not the case as the fanbase, which encompasses of Turbo virgin redditors and other uneducated meaningless lifeforms, deeply respect and defend the show almost making it impossible to criticize. I get that this is a shounen and all, so there are bound to be some “illogical” things here and there,          
                              Dr. Stone is amazing
                              Have you ever thought that the civilization now, which we built more than 200,000 years will be destroyed in a few seconds? Dr. Stone tells the story of a modern world that was destroyed because everyone turned to stone. I don't know even I don't want to know why they turned to stone. Senku who wants to accelerate science and bring it to the stone world. He tried to build a modern civilization to restore it to normal. Focuses on two things namely natural science and moral science, while the story itself, seems boring and unattractive because with that difference they create conflict that is          
                              Local turnip hair kid wakes up in a prehistoric future and uses the power of science and improbable percentages in an attempt to beat the anime version of Sid Meier's Civilization in record time.
                              Thrilling and satisfying, but imperfect and some times ugly, are the words I would use to describe dr.stone. While on other shounen animes you can only get the satisfaction at the end of an arc that takes dozen of episodes to get to, this anime does it in less than three episodes by putting smaller goals. Although, that doesn't mean it the best anime ever or even this season. The rewarding feeling that you get every few episodes is enough to make up for a ton of its flaws and make it memorable.
                              I was quite interested in this series going into it, with such an interesting premise it had a lot of potential to be something great. To have everyone get turned into stone and have our protagonist awaken 3,700 years later where he has to re-build society from scratch makes for a lot of interesting possibilities. However before this series was able to take advantage of this premise they drove it off a cliff by introducing what can best be described as a communist gorilla. I guess it couldn't be a shounen jump series without a shitty villain, huh?
                              Dr. Stone is an anime with a fascinating premise and a very intriguing world. On first pass, it looks competently animated, the plot progression is quite enjoyable, and hints at fascinating themes. With all those features, surely this series had to be quite great and I’m writing a rave review of it. Right? Well, in this stone world impossible things are possible. Despite all this series had going for it, it was wildly, ridiculously flawed. Dr. Stone is sophomorically directed, cartoonishly over-acted, and the largely decent soundtrack is used incorrectly. It’s childishly written, and its characters were unbearably cliché and plastic. It’s somehow simultaneously annoyingly          
                              Do you know who the strongest man alive is?
                              a friend of mine gave me the advice to watch me, speaking about how scientific this series is. i' ve found nothing about science in this series, at least if we don't consider some elementary school level things. totally overrated.

I hope you'll bear with me here, this is going to be a bit of a personal review, but I'll try to be fair. My anger has vanished in most parts although if someone says the words ""sabisu sabisu"" for a tease I still feel like kicking his butt delinquent-style.
                              Firstly, as if it needs to be pointed out, things in this movie have irrevocably changed from the TV Series. So different are the events in this movie, that, even with the 30 second preview at the end of the film, I have no clue what’s going to happen in the next movie (which will be called Evangelion Q, Quickening). Another thing is that things that were considered mysteries of the original TV series and movies are either gone altogether, changed, or spelled out.
                              Yup, that's a hot row of 10s right there, blatant and unabashed praise for the Evangelion Rebuild series, or as it should really be called; ""Anno's Attack on Anime"". Here's the truth: as an out-of-context standalone, this movie is a sack of shit. It's essentially harem-shonen-mecha-explosions with shallow characters all defined by their unexplained and nonsensical heart throbbings for Shinji, God of War. It doesn't present itself in this way, though: it's actually incredibly smart about it, sticking close to the original series in regards to content but constantly cutting and changing small things so that the end result is something that appears to be          
                              I know the Evangelion World since i was 11, and watched the whole serie for over 10 times, and when i knew that 4 more movies were about to come out, i couldn't wait for watch them.
                              Somehow, NGE has been turned into a high school harem comedy with giant robots.  There is pretty animation, but terrible direction, cinematography, music, and sound ruin that as well.          
                              I have waited for the opportunity to watch the new Evangelion for the long time. Today I have to admit that I am strongly surprised because of the enthusiastic reception of this movie. This is certainly a good position but it lacks a lot to be called a masterpiece.
                              I liked Evangelion 1.0, the ""cube"" angel had a great development and made the movie worth.

                              If you haven't seen the original Evangelion TV-series nor the first Rebuild-film, go watch them now. If you would like to read a potent critical view on the newest effort by Studio Khara and Gainax, read Liberal's rant a few reviews below. And if you feel like you're up to hearing another fanboy declaring his newfound love for this legendary mecha-anime, then read on.
                              I literally hate reviewing Evangelion. It's one of those series that you have to fully understand to enjoy it the most. Many people fail to do it. They tend to see only the shallow part of this show - mecha battles and romance (?) between some characters. Wrong. But it's not my cup of tea (yet) to change your mind on that dear fellas ;].
                              There are many English idioms about third attempts. Third time lucky, third time's the charm, and I'm sure there's a third one. The first time you try something, you inevitably screw up because you've never done it before. The second time you have a better grasp of what you're doing but perhaps haven't developed the expertise yet. Surely this next time around, you'll be able to get it right?
                              So, I've heard that this film lost out to Summer Wars in many festivals. Now, if that was a fair assessment, then Summer Wars must be one of the greatest movies ever made, because Evangelion 2.0 has set a new bar. Never in my life have I seen such great animation, this beautiful mix of 2D and 3D by sheer technical prowess has left other anime in the dust. Also, it is still one of the greatest stories ever told in anime. The subtle reimagining of the characters is brilliant, although I think it went a bit too far in making the characters more likable.          
                              I know many won't like this review, but I'm going to say my feelings anyway. However, I will point out that I'm looking at this in comparison to the TV series as I haven't read the manga.

                              Evangelion 2.0 is the second part of the rewrite of the popular NGE series, dubbed the ""Reubuild"" of Eva. It picks up after 1.0 and episode 8 or so of the original series. Now I remember watching 1.0 and I wasn't particularly impressed with it. Sure it had new shiny animation, soundtrack and so on, but it didn't really bring anything new to the table. In fact it followed the original series painstakingly to the mark, so it made me kinda skeptical about the whole rewrite aspect of this 4-part series. In hindsight, it was probably for the best since 1.0 slowly eases us back          ",178

Solely for this reason, the much hated ""Magus Killer"" Kiritsugu Emiya is hired by the Einzberns, with marriage to their only daughter Irisviel as binding contract.

Kiritsugu now stands at the center of a cutthroat game of survival, facing off against six other participants, each armed with an ancient familiar, and fueled by unique desires and ideals. Accompanied by his own familiar, Saber, the notorious mercenary soon finds his greatest opponent in Kirei Kotomine, a priest who seeks salvation from the emptiness within himself in pursuit of Kiritsugu.

Based on the light novel written by Gen Urobuchi, Fate/Zero depicts the events of the Fourth Holy Grail War—10 years prior to Fate/stay night. Witness a battle royale in which no one is guaranteed to survive.

                              Every once in awhile there will be an epic masterpiece that appears which is truly outstanding and fascinating. Fate/Zero is one of them, and i believe it has the potential to be one of the best anime of the year.
                              Ufotable probably used the Holy Grail and granted the fan's wish.most of the fans turned their attention to fate/zero the moment they heard about the involvement of ufotable since they knew they could expect great things with other works they had seen from them.as we all know just having a good story won't make an anime good.how to adapt it and include the parts of the story,the good use of music and art and many other things are playing a big role in an anime.this anime didn't disappoint and tried hard to bring out the awesomeness.
                              I wrote a review for Fate/Zero before but it got deleted because it only talked about the fight scenes. So I'm including the story in this review as well. Enjoy. 
                              When I first started this anime, I thought it was very good, but then it took a turn for the worse and became piss poor. Why you say? Maybe because every character falls into a generic archetype, such as, Irisvile (weak defenseless female), Saber ( strong female), and a boring protagonist who hardly ever shows up, and is apparently cheating on his wife. Now getting to the story, for the most part, it consists of Irisvile clinging to Saber's underwear while acting as a defenseless female who has no where better to be but involved in this Grail War which the shows speaks of a          
                              The main flaws with this anime are that it's dialogue heavy and the fights are ultimately pointless.
                              “Mature, innovative, fun and mesmerizing. A journey of epic proportions in a well-grounded mythological world based on reality, a masterpiece”

                              Fate/Zero is a show as confident in its storytelling as it is confused in its aims. After many tries, I've filed it away still unable to describe what point Urobuchi is trying to make with this. The closest I've come is that it's a condemnation of idealism, but this is only weakly supported by the text, and I suspect that impression is more a function of it being a prequel to a visual novel that thoroughly affirms the great moral significance of ideals. In that light, Fate/Zero's grim, cynical ending merely serves a narrative purpose. This doesn't make it unwatchable or even bad, but it          
                              In almost all forms of media, spinoffs, sequels, and prequels all have one thing in common. They are a crap shoot. Most of the time these spinoffs suck. Fortunately in anime, that is not always the case. In fact there are several times where I find myself enjoy the sequel/ prequel better than the original. However this anime is true rarity, in which the prequel just about outdoes the original in virtually every aspect. This review focuses solely on the first season of fate/zero. I'll write a separate review for season 2. 
                              Where do I begin with Fate/Zero? The first time I watched this series (roughly two years ago) I, admittedly, adored it. However, I recently rewatched it after reading the Fate/Stay Night light novel. It was then that my opinion of the seriess dropped substantially. Don't worry! This won't be a review where I bitch about how Fate/Zero messed up the characters that had been lovingly crafted in Fate/Stay Night! Indeed, I will try my best not to mention that wonderful novel (and godawful fanbase) and will instead focus on analyzing the content at hand. There will, however, be MILD SPOILERS. Consider yourself warned.
                              **SPOILER FREE REVIEW OF BOTH SEASONS (NOT FATE/STAY NIGHT)**
                              Fate/Zero will likely go down as one of anime’s best, or at least most famous prequels. Split into two seasons with 3 months between the airing of each, each half essentially becomes one of the highlights of their respective years. Season 1 is the more difficult of the two to tackle, as it’s primarily setting the stage for the tragedy that unfolds later on as it begins planting some of the seeds that would lead into the 3 well-known routes of Fate/Stay Night. It’s easy to praise the cinematic approach the show’s director, Ei Aoki, takes here. Both seasons are more strikingly directed than even

180,"According to Aniplex, a 10min short anime of Gintama ""Shiroyasha Koutan"" will be released on September 30th. It was shown at Jump Super Anime Tour 2008 and had never been released as a DVD.

It's a trailer of an imaginary Gintama movie. Gintama OVA shown at Jump Anime Tour '05 is also included in the DVD.",8.34,8,195,2183,53606,100,"                              Sunrise recognised the demand for a Gintama movie and so took the concept of a teaser, expanded it a little and made Shiroyasha Koutan for the 2008 Jump Anime Tour event. With only a little information and the runtime to go on, many fans assumed the special would be ten full minutes of action - perhaps a full sequence - set during the Joui war, possibly covering sections of main character Gintoki's past. The end result was completely unexpected, but so in Gintama's nature and an absolute treat for fans.
                              To sum it up simply, the first 3-4 minutes is presented in a serious and somewhat epic manner, revealing a bit of character background and story, along with great quality fighting scenes and of course heartmoving dialogue. 
                              The first part of the Jump Festa Gintama OVA series 2 gave you a serious note but then again, you got silver-trolled.
                              The Gintama series loves to troll it's viewers with false announcements like it's 'cancellation' and a 'Shinsengumi movie' apart from many other trolls (the biggest of which was a movie of the Benizakura arc which was a reality) and this was no other. Sunrise knows that it's fans want a Gintoki background story and they delivered one... Just kidding.
                              So, this ""trailer"" is basically a few minutes of Gintoki, Katsura, Sakamoto, and Takasugi in the Joui war, and the rest of the time is taken up by the characters complaining that Gintama hadn't gotten a movie yet (by 2008) and other characters complaining that they want more screen time.",180

For nine-year-old Ren, the last person who treated him with any form of kindness has been killed and he is shunned by what is left of his family. With no parents, no real family, and no place to go, Ren escapes into the confusing streets and alleyways of Shibuya. Through the twists and turns of the alleys, Ren stumbles into the intimidating Kumatetsu, who leads him to the beast realm of Shibuten.

For Kumatetsu, the boy represents a chance for him to become a candidate to replace the Lord of the realm once he retires. While nearly unmatched in combat, Kumatetsu's chilly persona leaves him with no disciples to teach and no way to prove he is worthy of becoming the Lord's successor. 

While the two share different goals, they agree to help each other in order to reach them. Kumatetsu searches for recognition; Ren, now known as Kyuuta, searches for the home he never had. As the years pass by, it starts to become apparent that the two are helping each other in more ways than they had originally thought. Perhaps there has always been less of a difference between them, a boy and a beast, than either of the two ever realized.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.33,8,199,458,309521,2705,"                              Saw this at the BFI film festival yesterday. Was quite disappointed actually, for reasons I've already read above. The plot felt rushed, the characters one dimensional and the overall world lacked depth. The main antagonist appeared out of nowhere towards the end for no other reason than the plot needed him to.
                              Mamoru Hosada is basically to Japanese animation what Disney is to Western animation: one of the better players in the field, but far from the best the medium has to offer. Just like Disney has never been able to produce a movie that my pre-college self would have loved but my post-college self just finds alright, I'm not too keen on rewatching any of Hosada's films these days whether or not I think they're good. Whilst the character animation being distractingly un-detailed compared to the rest of the animation is a bit of a sticking point in his films, my main problem with him are          
                              Hosoda continues to make films that are incredibly enjoyable to watch.  Bakemono no Ko (The Boy and the Beast), his first film produced under the banner of Studio Chizu, is another great addition to his directorial repertoire.  I was lucky to catch this film in theaters and my impression  is better for it.
                              Hosoda is here again with another modern tale, expanding the themes from his last movie about coexisting with another species.  At first glance, the movie feels like his 2006 feature The Girl Who Leapt Through Time in terms of atmosphere. They both start with a chill slice of life feeling that gains weight as it progresses. The difference is that TGWLTT is more likeable, whereas The Boy And The Beast takes a good 20 minute for you to get invested with the world and characters here presented. 
                              I wanted to like this anime so much. I saw everyone's reviews and recommendations and I had high hopes. 
                              Now I can't speak for everyone else because people will view and receive movies differently based on their experience. That being said, for me this Movie was a Masterpiece and would beg people to watch this movie who are into anime.  It is my favorite one out his other works. Didn't really care for Wolf children, just not my cup of tea, not that is was bad or anything just kinda boring for what I like to get out of movies. Summer wars was pretty good but this takes the cake. Apart from that I feel the anime speaks for itself, it had great          
                              Story: 8/10 What surprised me about the story was how fast it was and how many elements they were able to squeeze in. It almost felt as though it was written as a miniseries with different episodes focusing on different aspects, which they then turned into a film. Similarly, they also got in an abundance of morals and messages. Don't roll your eyes yet, because they're portrayed as realistically as possible for the scenarios, and only a couple are shoved in your face. However, as a side-effect of the pace and jumping focus, it felt rather disjointed at times, which is why I'm docking points.
                              Three years after Wolf Children, Hosoda comes back with a new epic featuring more drama based around the animal side of man: unfortunately, it's not as good as any of his past work, not because of the stagnant themes but for the sheer mediocrity of it.
                              I just returned from seeing The Boy and the Beast as part of the Glasgow Film Festival. I'd originally planned to stick around in the city afterwards but, feeling compelled to sit down and think about the movie, I just took the early train back to Edinburgh where I'm currently writing this review. That's right, I took an hour long train ride to see two hours of anime.
                              My first review on MAL and it being on a movie from Mamoru Hosoda, One of the Greats in the making was a treat. I'll be breaking down the movie from what I liked the most to least then an Overall Impression.
                              Synopsis:
                              I know that teacher-disciple themes are old school but ""The Boy And The Beast"" is unique.
                              Bakemono no Ko is a 2015 film written and directed by Hosoda Mamoru. We talked about him yesterday with Ookami Kodomo. I guess people just want to see me look at his films this year. So, how does this compare to his other two films I've reviewed? Will it be the first bad one? The best one yet? Exactly in between the other two? Let's find out, shall we?
                              ""Overall, the plot to this movie was absolutely insulting, and I feel it didn't use it's time well at all (which is impressive when it's goddamn 2 hours long), and the world it tries to set up is an absolute joke. Like the sweet, soothing melodies of Cannibal Corpse... ...the Boy and the Beast is: 
                              At first I expected, ""Oh, all right, this will gonna be one of those Hollywood movie where the master teaches this outsider kid, huh?"". I expected a fucking Karate Kid.",184

The first season consisted of only 13 episodes. It adapted the general premise of the story and had its character roster in set. However, it missed the opportunity to expand more and build on those elements. Have no fear. Season 2 is here and it’s set to fill the gaps for you diehard fans of this classic shounen adventure.
                              *Minimum Spoiler Plus Ultra Review*
                              This is a two-part review where I'll be weighing in the positives and negatives of this show. 
                              I know this might sound exaggerated — “2/10? Are you insane?” — but please just hear me out for a second...
                              Boku no Hero Academia is often said to be the new Naruto or One Piece - the next smash-hit action series. Season 1 laid the groundwork for that, but at a mere 13 episodes, it couldn't truly demonstrate why Hero Academia deserves to be considered THE new great action series. But with season 2 comes a solid 25-episode run, giving it the chance to spread its wings and prove that not only is it a great successor to the old genre greats, but in many respects improves on them.
                              This review covers both seasons and will contain some vague spoilers.
                              I really did try to go into this with a positive attitude. I wanted to like it. This season could have very well been 12 episodes instead of the excruciatingly drawn out 25. Really all that tells me is VERY. POOR. WRITING. With this show being so popular and having such a high MAL score I had high expectations. I am being sorely let down. I didn't even want to finish watching this season. I usually only drop shows if it is boring me to death. I was almost to my limit with this one. 
                              The shounen that took Naruto's place was a huge disappointment for me and I will try to explain why here. I do not think that this review will change a lot of opinions, but I found it fun to write this, so here is a piece of my mind.
                              This show is completely for kids... i dont know why so many peoples like this anime.. so many points i dont understand like....
                              The goddamn hero ideology....why.....what is it with that naive hero mindset?! Let's talk about Endeavor, the guy literally ABUSES his wife, but he's still a hero?!!! You hypocritical pieces of shit!! Such an unoriginal and annoying anime! It overuses some of anime's most annoying tropes. They took the worst characteristics of all the Shounen MCs from the past 10 years and created Midoriya....one of the most frustrating characters I have ever come across. Makes this one of the most overrated shows in Anime history. I really don't understand the charm of a nerdy coward, who is very very unrealistically nice to everyone. Although have to          
                              Uh ok, so ... the only progress from Midoriya we see is after season 1, and after the first part of season 2? Is this a joke right? i mean... all of these episodes full of blah blah and fights, that made Todoroki have more mental progress than Midoriya. The MC keeps being a chiken after what we saw happened in first season, he is still full of openings like we saw through the whole story, but specially at that last episode.
                              (You must see season 1 first before you go to reviews of the 2nd season because there will be some spoilers about season 1.There will be some spoilers also from Season 2)
                              Season 2 is both the peak and fall of this show.
                              Note: This is a review for all of Boku no Hero Academia. The reason I chose this season to review was because in my opinion, this is overall the weakest entry in the series.

These episodes focus on Kurapica's quest for revenge and his eternal hunt for his clan member's eyes.
                              i get right to it...because i have no time to waste got to go watch the other OVA asap.

I became addicted and went back to finish the originals, and here I am. All I have to say is: if you're here after watching the original series and liking it, you're not going to be disappointed. 
                              As I stated before, the original Hunter X Hunter Anime ended towards the end of the Yorkshin Arc, cutting off right after the gang finally gets back together. However that wouldn’t be the end of this Version of Hunter X Hunter. Oh no, for as you see, Nippon Animation was far from done with this series. What they decided to do once the televised run was over was to simply switch format, continuing the show in an OVA format instead. Hell, the Episode count doesn’t even reset with these OVAs, so you could just consider them Episodes 61-92 of the TV Series, which is how

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.33,8,202,609,240240,2105,"                              Foreword:
                              K-ON may be a controversial series, and some may think anything to do with K-ON is nothing but overrated. Subjectively, I love the series. The daily school lives of the light music club and the live gigs, are never tiring to watch. Throughout season one and two, the series had shown us a simple, fun, relaxing and heart-warming ambiance through and through. As soon as the movie’s subs was out, it doesn’t take long for me to pop up my video player, and enjoy another near two hours of cuteness and fluffiness.
                              K-ON! was never a series with much direction but for many this wasn’t much of a problem. Thirty minutes of pleasant humour with a simple storyline to tie it together- a formula for success. However, when one attempts to stretch those thirty minutes of heaven into a two hour long movie, its weaknesses become apparent rather quickly. So the question is, will the K-ON! movie be able to overcome it?
                              Among Kyoto Animation's many shows, K-On seems to be one of the most divisive. The first Season was a fun but ultimately very empty and unrewarding experience which led to the attracting a lot of hate. Those who  stuck by it, however, where treated with a wonderful coming of age story and a bittersweet conclusion in the Second Season. Although Season 2 was a huge improvement it was not without its flaws. For a slice of life show, some thought thought that 26 episodes was too much. But for the fans, its long length was able to satisfy their craving for more K-On. But          
                              It's been a while since I looked at the first series of Kyoto animation's K-on. The final verdict for the series was that it was really good. Having a great sense of humour and being fun to watch. Someday, I'll undoubtedly get around to reviewing the second series but, for the time being, let's look at the film that came out in December of 2011. 
                              I watched 2 seasons of K-ON, the story is light, but for this one movie, I give ""standing applause"" because it has exceeded my expectations. K-On films can really take me into the story. when the beginning of the film began, I said whether K-On movie would provide beautiful music at the end, because for 2 seasons, I felt that the song that HTT performed not special. but apparently they can give me what I expect. beautiful music with deep meaning. thank you to all who have been instrumental in the process of adapting K-ON Films. You have managed to make me smile and hold          
                              Just saw this tonight in theaters in Japan.  It was super cute, had all the favorite characters and shenanigans (some of them just happen to be London, so there was some cute novelty, especially enjoyable for one who knows how awkward it is to be in a country where you're not fluent in the language, haha).  Definitely laughed out loud a couple times. The art was the same if not nicer than the anime, new songs were great and old classics were included as well. I'd say it's about the same as the TV show in that there wasn't much of a plot,          
                              When discussing 'moe', k-on is typically the first series that comes to mind for many people. It has represented for many, the pinnacle of 'cute girls doing cute things' and many take comfort in knowing that this is either as bad or as good as it gets for some. I don't like K-on. In fact, I hate it. I think it's one of the worst series in the industry. 
                              After-school Teatime's cinema debut was executed perfectly.
                              For the sake of perspective, let me first say that I am not a big fan of season one of K-ON. I thought it was overrated and dull. However, I am a moderate fan of season two, which was a lot more enjoyable. Maybe it's just because I already expected season two to be episodes and episodes of fluffy nothingness as opposed to season one where I was expecting a rockin' show about music. But whatever, the point is my opinion on K-ON before watching this movie was more or less ""meh.""
                              This is my first review, so bear with me. I'm not going to do the Story/Art/Sound etc. format. 
                              For anyone who wants to know K-On! is my favorite animated series of all time, and having recently just rewatched the movie I feel it is appropriate to try and explain just why I love it (K-On! Movie) so much.
                              This review will be controversial. The reason I say this is because although it seems paradoxical, in this review I will be shredding apart the “moe” phenomenon, while praising this movie at the same time. If that sounds incomprehensible to you then keep reading and maybe you’ll see where I’m coming from. By the way, I’m not going to say that much about the movie but talk more about my personal experience with “K-ON!” as a whole as well as other related anime.
                              I've seen it. Finally.
                              There is a reason why I rated this higher than the seasons shown on television. One immediate reason is that it truly sticks to the whole theme of the entire series.  ",188

Now in Natsume's possession, the book gives Reiko's grandson this power as well, which is why these enraged beings now haunt him in hopes of somehow attaining their freedom.

Without parents and a loving home, and constantly being hunted by hostile, merciless youkai, Natsume is looking for solace—a place where he belongs. However, his only companion is a self-proclaimed bodyguard named Madara. Fondly referred to as Nyanko-sensei, Madara is a mysterious, pint-sized feline spirit who has his own reasons for sticking with the boy.

Based on the critically acclaimed manga by Yuki Midorikawa, Natsume Yuujinchou is an unconventional and supernatural slice-of-life series that follows Natsume as he, with his infamous protector Madara, endeavors to free the spirits bound by his grandmother's contract.

The amount of emotions you'll experience is nothing short of incredible, especially when you consider the anime's 13 episode length.
                              Honestly, I don't really understand why this anime has so many amazing ratings. This isn't the worst anime i've ever seen- no, but I certainly do not think it's anywhere near the best.
                              Oh my goodness, where to start.
                              No spoilers.
                              Natsume Yuujinchou follows the supernatural/natural genre that seems to be a cross between xxxholic, ghost hound and mushishi. It has a Mushishi-like elegance to the artwork and storytelling while at the same time following an xxxholic-esque structure aka. schoolboy meets schoolghost.
                              Why this anime is so far up the Top Anime list, I will never know because this was one of the worst animes I've ever watched. I'm disappointed I wasted so much of my precious time on this shit. The only reason I gave it an over 3 rather than a 2 was because I did the math. 
                              Watching Natsume Yuujinchou felt like strolling down a road of flawlessness - no obstructions, no inconveniences. Simply a straight, smooth and simple road that leads to the beautiful horizon which awaits at the end of the road. 
                              Natsume Yuujinchou is a series that began as a shoujo manga by Midorikawa Yuki. In 2008 an anime adaptation by Brain's Base aired. You may remember them from such anime as Baccano, Durarara, Penguindrum, Ixion Saga DT & Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru. So, their stuff has been pretty mixed from what I've seen. With Oregairu at the upper end and Ixion Saga & Penguindrum tied at the low end. How will this one place? Let's have a look.
                              This is my first anime review, so here goes.
                              NOTE: Since the content in all three seasons is similar enough that they don't warrant separate reviews, they will all be covered here. The fourth will be edited in when it finishes, unless it differs heavily from the first three by the end of its run.
                              I watched this anime basically on a whim. I read the name somewhere and just started watching it. I have to say that I wasn’t too impressed by this series by the first episode, but that certainly changed later on.
                              This is one of those animes which just somehow makes its way into your heart and makes such a deep imprint that you would probably never be able to forget it. Natsume Yuujinchou (I watched all 4 seasons, and reviewing them in one go as they are more like a single entity anyway) is a beautiful rare gem in the anime world that often goes unnoticed, yet each and every person I know who have watched it have been touched so deeply by it. 
                              ""Natsume's Book of Friends"" (Natsume Yuujinchou) is like a loaf of bread.  Not spicy, not over-sweet, pretty plain...and yet very satisfying.  It's a show I enjoy watching whenever life has been busy, complicated, or stressful, and I just want to clear my mind and relax.  When I don't want heavy plotlines, psychological twists, or violence.  When I crave something simple.
                              This is not an anime for people who are looking for something with action and cute characters. Natsume Yuujinchou is a thought provoking anime, one that encompasses many different genres (drama, slice of life, tragedy, fantasy). The story may look slow but each episode is well thought out and provides insights on the main characters of the anime. Each episode has a message or a lesson for Natsume, and viewers in my opinion; most of them are common knowledge, but they serve as a reminder to the people who watch the series.
                              A friend introduced and urged me to watch this anime. I am always interested in stuff associated with youkai so I knew I had to give this a shot. This is probably the most light hearted anime I've watched so far, especially the ending song is just soooooo soothing. The anime have a episode by episode plot so you don't have to complete the whole series in one day. A calm and peaceful anime with a hint of humour in it. I wouldn't say it was action packed.           ",189

                              After putting this off for eons, I've finally decided to review Rose of Versailles. This is an anime that almost everyone has heard of, but fewer people have actually seen. In terms of popularity, Rose of Versailles isn't ranked in the top 1,800. I've yet to convince any of my offline buddies to check this one out because when you recommend this anime to people you're usually met with stuff like ""It's so OLD though!"" Or sometimes you might hear ""Isn't that one of those elitist series? Doesn't that mean it's going to be super boring and pretentious?"" These attitudes are unfortunate because I think          
                              Wow, what a story. I can't believe I haven't watched this anime until now. No, I can't believe what I just watched. I'd always thought that the forbidden love romance between Romeo and Juliet was tragic... I'd always thought that Shingeki no Kyojin was epic. I'd always thought that stories like Clannad and AnoHana were masterpieces. But wow, Rose of Versailles puts all of these shows to shame. Who knew that an anime,  which some people (idiots) call ""cartoons"", could portray such a realistic, romantic, tragic, and captivating historical story about the events leading up to the french revolution - 1700s. Rose of Versailles          
                              It’s the eve of the 18th century and France is flailing between hubris and chaos.
                              Story
                              It's without hesitation that I'd consider Rose of Versailles to be the definitive masterpiece of the shoujo genre. Clearly defined, ambitious, and relentless, it accurately dramatizes the period of instability leading up and into the French Revolution, all the while developing memorable and unique characters. Thanks to this grace, it has had an influence on anime and manga to this day. 
                              The Rose of Versailles is an old school anime. It aired from 1979-1980 and was based off of a manga from the early 70s. It was brought to us by TMS, the same studio behind the mediocre Magic Knight Rayearth, the excellent Glass no Kamen & the decent enough Kousetsu Hyaku Monogatari. Is this one a classic worth revisiting? Let's find out. 
                              Before you read this I will ask of you to not judge it solely on the high ratings. I feel like I have explained the reasons for giving them quite well. Please in your rating, let me know the way to improve on it and I will promptly do so. The high animation rating is based on what could be accomplished at the time the anime was made as I realise that it would be sub-standard if it were made nowadays.
                              If you combined certain elements of Revolutionary Girl Utena with the novel Les Miserables by Victor Hugo, you'd get Rose of Versailles.
                              As a general rule, I'm not into shoujos - joseis yes, but not shoujos. ""Rose of Versailles"" is a shoujo.
                              Critic’s Log – July 14, 2015. Review #95: The Rose of Versailles
                              Rose of Versailles is a typical shoujo romance set not long before and during French Revolution. It executes both badly. There are gonna be spoilers here.
                              70’s. Somehow, the ‘70’s-ness made this show better. The ridiculous sound effects crack me up every time, and that's good because otherwise the show might just be too heavy. The animation is at times downright shabby by our standards, however what do you expect, some three decades later? To enjoy this show, you have to accept that it has a lot of faults, and that despite that it entertains quite strongly. 
                              The Rose of Versailles tells the events leading up to the French Revolution with an added twist - shaping its events around the struggles of two fictional characters, Oscar Francois de Jarjeyes and André Grandier. It's interesting because even though these characters never actually existed, the author managed to interweave their stories with real historical figures like Marie Antoinette and Hans Axel von Fersen. In fact, the narratives pushed in these real historical events make it seem like Oscar and Andre were real people involved. It's really amazing how the author managed to add in fictional characters to these events without creating plot holes that

                              Evangelion is widely considered one of the most influential anime created in the 1990's, if not of all time. It is extremely well known for it's brave attempts to turn the mecha genre on it's head, it's deep character development, and it's unorthodox storyline. Created by acclaimed studio Gainax, and written by both praised (and sometimes hated) writer Hideaki Anno, Evangelion has been called a masterpiece by anime fans. Does it deserve this praise.
                              Mod Edit: This review may contain spoilers.
                              Hugely experimental and thankfully unique, Evangelion is a roaring failure.
                              Neon Genesis Evangelion is probably familiar to most of you. It's a well-known series from Gainax written by Anno Hideaki. It's also an anime I never got all the way through before this point. I tried several years before I wrote my first review when I was watching a bunch of anime because they had Hayashibara Megumi. I got through Nuku Nuku, Blue Seed, Saber Marionette, the Slayers, Love Hina, Bakuretsu Hunters and some others. Evangelion was the only series I couldn't get through. The characters annoyed me more than any cast I'd ever seen and the story was pants. In the end I got          
                              Neon Genesis Evangelion has been known to divide audiences. And despite its love for giant robot battles and generous use of fan service, Neon Genesis Evangelion is unarguably one... of the most influential sagas in modern anime. In the history of anime no series has sparked more debate than Evangelion. For every viewer who's enthralled by its mix of classic anime action, convoluted philosophy, psychological angst, and religious imagery, there's another who finds it pretentious and ponderous.
                              One of my absolute favorite things about this anime is how they have implemented lots of references to old religious symbols and characters; and how it's all done. They make the series into something more by doing this; it gives it a unique feel that I still haven't seen in other series. 
                              I realize that I'm likely painting a target on my face with this one, but here goes. Please read to the end, as my recommendation may surprise.
                              Overview:
                              Overhype, thy name is Evangelion.
                              Neon Genesis Evangelion is perhaps the most popular anime of all time, trumping the majority of anime franchises, and is often considered to be the best anime of all time. Needless to say, it isn't. Not even close. Although it certainly had the potential to be, it just didn't live up to it. Which isn't to say Evangelion is bad, no. Evangelion is actually very good in many, many ways. The problem is, it counteracts this by having some horrible problem in another way.
                              This was a rather tricky programme to review. Great pains were taken to avoid spoilers so if you're a fan of Eva, please don't take umbrage with me for not going in-depth with certain areas. If you happen to dislike Eva or feel that it's overrated, I'd still encourage you to read through this entire review. Feedback is greatly appreciated, as always. On another note, this review will NOT cover Evangelion's religious symbolism at all. I tried to in earlier drafts of this review, but they just made the review much longer and more tedious than they needed to be.
                              Neon Genesis Evangelion is one of the most well known anime of the 1990s. Whether someone recommended it to you or you happened to read the name in passing, Evangelion is a name that’s impossible to escape if you’re a part of the anime community. However, with its fame also comes controversy. The show has got to be one of the most divisive anime ever made. Many love it and consider it to be one of the greatest anime to come out of the 1990s and others consider it to be a pretentious mess with irritating characters. Well based on the score I’m pretty sure          
                              Neon Genesis Evangelion.

                              [Spoiler Warning]
                              Having read the light novel, No Game No Life Zero was everything i expected it to be. You shouldn't be watching this movie with similar expectations to the series in mind mainly because the setting of both stories in the anime and the movie are worlds apart (hah see what I did there). One important thing to keep in mind is despite the movie's main purpose being to explain the origins of the world of Disboard(current NGNL world), the story is focused on the development of a romance between the two MCs and their efforts to change the world.
                              *Royalty-free fanfare*
                              As someone who loves anime, spending my summer in japan to visit my japanese cousins was pretty lucky. No Game No Life:Zero is a must watch for anyone who has watched the original television series.
                              We often remember No Game No Life as that one anime with pink gradients and excessively bright color-schemes. When this district art-style suddenly changes, the atmosphere and our expectations for what’s to come change along with it. I’m sure you all remember how impactful the first 9 minutes of episode 9 were, with its complete grayscale with lack of context. No Game No Life: Zero, in short, gives you a similar feel through a ninety-minute emotional roller-coaster, completely remaking its original Gaming/Comedy genre into something more touching, but none the less still very entertaining.
                              ***EDIT!!! I've now seen the film twice. In my second viewing I was able to pretty much assure what I put down in this review originally was pretty close to my feelings towards the film. However there is a change to the “characters” category. My new thoughts will be listed under the original paragraph.***
                              Remember No Game No Life? That somewhat entertaining anime about 2 teens Isekai'd into some fantasy land and play games as well as get into harem shenanigans. Fair enough, nothing groundbreaking, but nothing offensive too (except for Stephanie Dola, she needs to be hung). So imagine my surprise when it's 4 years later and they decide to make a movie prequel that takes a darker tone and is considerably more serious. I bought a ticket (because Mary and The Witch's Flower wasn't playing anymore), got my popcorn (from a dollar store) and got comfy. Does Zero hold up to the rest of the series?
                              l would like to say no game no life: zero have different plot than no game no life. It has more darker world and story but beyond the scope of movie it is the part of whole story. And the more you dig in the story , the more you get enjoy. And details like Tet's appearance and clothes or the fact Disboard (the name of the world in no game no life) is actually a game. These are outstanding and stylish. The movie is being told by Tet like a myth. But in the middle of movie there is no story anymore for audience.

                              I TOTALLY DIDN'T EXPECT WHAT I'M ABOUT TO WATCH HAS THIS POWERFUL IMPACT!
                              This is an exceptional anime movie. Honestly, if you're putting this off because it wont feature the two main characters from the original, don't do that to yourself. This ties into the other universe phenomenally.
                              From what i read in the novel ; 
                              No Game No Life Zero is a prequel to the events to the anime, focusing on Riku and his robotic companion Shuvi. That's pretty much all you need to know for this particular review.",194

                              I've seen my fair share of music anime, but this is the first time the musical genre has been my first love: classical music.
                              Personally, I think Nodame Cantabile is in a league by itself when it comes to chemistry between characters.
                              What can I say about Nodame Cantobile? It was one of those anime that you can\'t help but enjoy. It managed to tell a fun story in which each of the characters try to accomplish what they want out of life with a careful mix of humor and drama.
                              Introduction
                              Nodame Cantabile is strange in some regards. It has a good story, full of excellent music, but the transition into the anime medium is a rocky and half-hearted one.

                              Nodame.  She just captured my heart entirely and left me glowing inside and out.
                              A quite funny argument you might find occasionally in defense of a work is the saying “you watched it wrong”, implying that any criticism the person might have to the series in question comes from having watched it with the wrong mindset. While I find particularly silly that one would primarily assume such case about someone else’s opinion when facing criticism to a beloved work, since it’s a very pretentious attitude, it doesn’t seem unlikely that a circumstance like that can happen. That was the issue I faced when I began watching Nodame Cantabile, an anime I started with the expectation of being a straight          
                              Pros
                              If Nodame wasn't in the show I would have loved it however her character was annoying and I either wanted to shoot her or shoot myself. If I ever meet someone with such a character in real life, that's exactly what would happen. I can't stand Nodame. The rest of the show was good, even close to excellent. The music was wonderful, the art was good, and the rest of the characters were funny and held certain interests. Nodame killed all hope of me ever enjoying this show.          
                              I have to admit, I was very worried about this. I ended up putting off watching it for two weeks, even. It's all because I know absolutely nothing about music, especially the classics. If it sounds good, I'll listen to it. Doesn't matter to me what the instruments are or how long it took to perfect. 
                              Nodame Cantibile is a lighthearted and comedic anime about one of my favorite hobbies, music.  At first I was hesitant to explore the series due to my lack of appreciation for the classical genre, but what I found in Nodame Cantibile was more than just music.  This was a coming of age story of sorts, with a feel good plot line and characters full of passion, all battling their own internal struggles to be better musicians.  It’s definitely a nice change of pace and a must see for any slice of life fan, or enthusiast of music in general.
                              Nodame Cantabile is an anime I truly love, but my honest opinion is it does not deserve a 10/10 despite how enjoyable it was.",195

                              To put it simply. This is a much better ending than the original. I felt the action and how fast everything seemed just didn't fit the rest of the show. But thankfully with this, we got a much more natural and satisfying ending for such a great show.
                              ""Can I put 'love' to words, when I don't know what 'love' is?""
                              Stick to the formula. Get the same results. 
                              Violet Evergarden is a beautiful story about loving others and its consequences. Love indeed touches people and their hearts like anything else. If there is one anime, one story that can pull off ""love"" in a virtual storyline - it shall be Violet Evergarden.
                              I want to start by saying that this might contain a little spoiler so please keep that in mind.
                              Let me begin by saying that I watched the main ""Violet Evergarden"" show and actually liked it and gave it an 8. In my review for the main show I mentioned that Violet's episodes are mostly stand-alone, each with its own story and very loosely connected. It is not surprising then that the OVA is basically a canon episode and would probably be indistinguishable from the others if you watched it without knowing it's the OVA.
                              With this special episode Violet Evergarden proves to us once again how the power of words can change the world around a person and how hard it is to find the perfect words for the dear ones. The  timeline of the story is set between episode 4 and 5 and the focus is on a opera singer who is trying to convey her feelings of love for the dear one through her acting and singing. Violet as you know will try do to her best to help her but now she is in a pinch and that is what makes this special worth watching,          
                              “Violet Evergarden: Kitto ""Koi"" wo Shiru Hi ga Kuru no Darou” is an OVA that doesn't differ from the traditional content the normal episodes of the parent series deliver, it makes it pretty odd to see it released as a standalone piece of animation.
                              This was a great OVA, and I'm happy for this extra little story. It was really heartwarming, the story was beautiful.
                              Surprisingly enough, I liked this short OVA more than the Gaiden Eternity movie. I felt like this episode fleshed out the characters a lot better, describing the effects of the war on so many ordinary people, not just those who worked in the military. The war may have ended, but their hearts were frozen in time and I understand how it must be so difficult to accept progress, both emotionally and in terms of societal development. I really enjoyed how this elaboration of the setting and collective mindset supported Violet's own situation, and how this side story pushed her to understand what ""love"" and ""moving          
                              After watching all aired seasons and movies I confirm I  am in love with this series.  its is super warm and and it touches your soul, it indeed conveys the human feelings to the audience and makes you feel as if you are there with them inside the anime itself.
                              For context, I give the main show a 10. I really love Violet Evergarden, and I'm really looking forward to the film. It's great that they released an unaired episode from the show as an OVA later on.
                              This OVA lives up to the whole series. same quality of art, sound.. and brings one more emotional and well written story that in just a few minutes makes us empathize with the characters and their situation. The soundtrack fits perfectly in the narrative and makes us live the story as a awaken dream.

                              Holy hot damn, this anime just keeps surprising me. I'll tell you what, the end of this season had me so stressed that my heart was beating as though I'd just run the mile. I'm gonna try to keep this review short because my review of the first season was pretty through in explaining why this anime is so good, but I'm gonna hit some of the points that got better for me this season or things I noticed more.
                              Starting this series was an impulsive decision while I was on a sports anime binge. I don’t regret it at all. Even though I’ve never watched a real baseball game and the sport is virtually non-existent in my country, I quickly grew to like it.
                              The 2nd season for Diamond no Ace keeps the hope of winning a ticket to national tournament alive!
                                Since  you came to read the reviews of the 2nd season i assume you ve already seen the 1st. (if not, well you are a bit of an oddball)
                              Following this series for two years, left me devastated when I knew my Monday will go on without a new episode of this series.
                              This is my first time to write a fullest review,really I've been write the same review abuout before.but,I thought previous most contents wrong grammar so I deleted it.why I write first for this? it causes most so wonderous and unforgottable story.I ever thought that so difficult and boring to playing baseball.nevertheless,my view got changed while I completed it.so,don't you'd be missing out on one of the best sports anime here.
                              Comparing to season 1, this season has improved a whole lot. Sawamura finally became useful. If you like Miyuki then this is the season where he shines the most. There were some epic moments here and there as well as touching moments. What I do not enjoy however, is the episode where Seido had to compete against a school with many bulky school member. I know for a fact that the author is trying to make it as a challenge that Seido had to overcome, however, it made it seem like the author is encouraging violence in sports. I can elaborate more but it can          
                              Dimaond no ace> you must watch this anime ! you will love it if you love genre sport ,the main character sawamura eijun it's person who cheerful and never give up, althoung i love the second character furuya ^^""
                              ⠀⠀So of course I loved season two of DNA it's my 3rd favorite sport anime! And season 2 just made everything better, with Seido getting they're ticket to Nationals! 
                              There are no spoilers in this review. My rating system counts story for 30% of the total, characters as 30%, art as 20%, and 20% for the sound.  
                              History: 8.5
                              This was my first venture into the baseball sports anime genre. I have never watched a single baseball game in my life and was never intrested in one until I watched Diamond no Ace. I expected it to some boring anime of a team trying to play baseball as hard as they can. But sometime after that Diamond no Ace was approved for 52 episodes for its first season and the it was being produced by Madhouse. So I thought i would give it a try and to my surprise Diamond no Ace is now one of my all-time favourite shows.
                              This is my first time to write a review because I truly think that this anime deserves way more praise than it currently receives. In my circle of friends, I'm the only one who watched this anime because of the fact that the sport featured in this anime - baseball, is boring. But don't let that stop you since you'd be missing out on one of the best sports anime out there.
                              I was quite excited to find that Diamond no Ace was getting a second season basically straight after it finished. Although the first few episodes were recaps, I found this sequel on-par with, or maybe even better than, the first season.",197

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.32,8,215,945,158886,3827,"                              Reading the manga, a lot of stuff bugged me. Mostly how quickly the storyline just moved on. The characters and relationship didn't get time to properly develop or even be introduced well. The idea of this story was cute, but the way it was told turned the manga pretty shitty. However, in the movie they changed all of that. The creators stretched out all of the ""soon-to-be-over"" scenes, and ended up spending their time very well. This way it was easier for me to really get to know the characters, and for their relationship to build. They also managed to not stretch anything too far.          
                              DO NOT WATCH THIS
                              You have no idea how long I've been waiting for this. I've been familiar with the source material for more than a couple of years and have read it over and again multiple times. I've even listened to the Drama CD more times than I would probably ever confess to. 
                              (Intro is spoilers sorry even then it doesn't take away enjoyment.)
                              Well, you can definitely say that Doukyuusei is aesthetically pleasing. The colours used for backgrounds are generally muted, but the characters are vivid. Expressions are adorably drawn and very clear through a distinct art style.
                              I was really pumped when I heard there was a decent, cute BL anime movie coming out. I was a little disappointed. Not because it was bad, because by any means it's a decent flick, but because it was only merely okay.
                              I was really excited about this anime. I heard great things about it, and having been monumentally disappointed with the BL genre in general, I thought that FINALLY a gem had been made.
                              I do not enjoy this movie as much as other people do, just because I found the pacing to be too quick. If this were episodes, I would probably enjoy it more than I do. 
                              Very much enjoyed watching! A very light yet touching watch, a feel good movie for people who seek a little bit of youth romance. Just enough fluffy, chummy, lovey-dovey stuff to compliment the story. 
                              The build up of the story is quite simple, but is done in a clever way. The plot is compelling and sweet, and it doesn't drag on for longer than it has to.
                              This is the type of movie you watch when you want to put a smile on your face! It's very sweet and all around a very pleasant movie to watch! The animation looked great (when the characters would run on screen they did look slightly wonky but that's fine) and the backgrounds were all very nicely done. The characters I really enjoyed. Also if you already watched the movie.. did you think it was weird how that teacher guy kissed the student and then nothing ever happened after that?? I thought that was kind of odd! I mean the teacher never got in trouble and          
                              To be honest i never actually thought i would like this when my friend recommended this to me as I was never really into the yaoi and romance genre. But I was wrong.
                              Doukyuusei is aesthetically pleasing, though there were many things that confused or upset me.
                              Well I have to say that this was a rather interesting movie, but I need to point out a major flaw. This was simply found rushed to me, as I feel like there was simply not enough time, in that hour to really tell the story. Unlike the manga, there is no real development of their relationship, nor other feelings like jealousy are shown, like it has been in the manga. It's a bit of a shame, since I felt like that is what really made the manga what it is, and it could have been easily incorporated into the movie too. Maybe if this          
                              A very good movie to watch on a summer day. It's light, with a little bit of pain. The art is wonderful. I actually never read the manga of this movie, because I don't like to read things that make me sad, and I knew this story will most probably make me cry. But in the movie it was actually what added the deeper layer to it. It's a very simple movie, and watching it definitely made me think of ""youth"". Also a note that I believe is important: there are no homophobic slurs in this film. This film is about love between two people,          ",198

Noticing Uenoyama's knowledge of the instrument, Satou pleads for him to fix it and to teach him how to play. Uenoyama eventually agrees and invites him to sit in on a jam session with his two band mates: bassist Haruki Nakayama and drummer Akihiko Kaji.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.32,8,216,552,267264,9477,"                              Given strikes the rare balance of being openly gay - none of that maybe he is, maybe he isn’t crap - while not indulging in over the top eroticism to pander to a niche viewership. This is a vanilla, realistic, down to earth romance that can be watched by anyone open minded to love that exceeds conventional desire. 
                              As Crunchyroll states it: ""Why You Should Rock Out With Given, The Best Summer Anime You're NOT Watching"" AND YOU SHOULD WATCH IT, regardless if you're a fan of Shounen Ai (or as we otakus like to call it BL) or not. Heck, it's not even about if you're a straight male or female casually watching BL. It's just SIMPLY PHENOMENAL in every degree.
                              ""Whatever you left behind became my everything and life."" - Unknown person
                              (EDIT PART) This week I found out that Given is a Haikyu! DJ so I take out everything I said before because you can see the author obscenely stole the character's design and personality.
                              I am absolutely baffled to see the amount of positive reviews written for this series, I seriously can't tell if the score is just inflated due to the little amount of viewers this series has received or I just don't understand fujoshis in general. This series has so many major flaws and barely any of the reviews cover what makes this show so insufferably dull and uninteresting.
                              Given is 2019’s dark horse. It’s a title that has been slept on for its subject matter instead of appreciated for its prowess. Unlike Bloom Into You which received a major backing over the course of its run, Given seems to have received little fanfare within the community despite the praise most viewers have for it. I wouldn’t call it amazing, but it certainly does resonate, much like a good tune.
                              Shounen ai isn't something that most anime fans find comfortable watching. Not that it makes these viewers necessarily homophobic, but considering the genre's abysmal record of featuring BL containing romanticized sexual assault (I'm looking at you Junjou Romantica) to portray romance between men—on top of subpar writing and cringe-worthy dialogues, it's understandable that viewers would rather avoid it.
                              “Everything that you left behind became my everything.”
                              I'm having a hard time figuring out what to start this review with, simply because even days after its conclusion I still have so many thoughts and feelings swirling around about it. Perhaps saying ""nevermind the genre categories"" is a good start. Sure, they give clues as to what to expect, but expectations are dangerous. Many of those words that describe genre have way too many negative connotations, which inevitably influence one's decision to watch or avoid a certain anime. And even without those connotations, I'm sure ""shounen ai"" is something many people avoid on principle. Well, here's a great reason why you should not.          
                              Now that I've finished the series I have to say Given is perhaps one of my favorite Shonen-ai anime adaptions of all time, it was just perfect right down to the music which was absolutely breathtaking, not many Shonen-ai or Yaoi shows can do that. 
                              “It all started with that chord I played. I had no idea that I was strumming hard on his heartstrings with my own fingers.”
                              Yeah once again I'm here and ready to kind of maybe sort of share what I think
                              A soft, dappled light pools in the corner of a stairway, warm and nostalgic like a home you never realized you were missing. A boy sleeps in that light, a guitar clutched to his chest. From a glance, he seems adrift, like a lost rowboat bobbing on a dark, cloudy ocean. For a moment, all is silent and still. It might as well be a framed photograph.
                              This was a really sweet and touching anime about the development of a relationship between two guys, one of them overcoming past traumas, while the other is trying to rekindle his passion for music. Both of them need one another (not in the emotional-dependency, unhealthy kind of way), but in a way that makes them both stronger and better people when they're together. 
                              Normally, I wouldn't have given two shits about ""Given"", not because I'm a homophobe, mostly because I'm not that into romance in general. I like romance, but with something else there to make it a little more interesting. ",199

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.31,8,217,568,258139,7109,"                              First of all, it is much better than expected. The storyline was so interesting and wonderfully executed, that I even disregarded the sub par drawing style . I like the idea of a band struggling to make it big not only in Japan, but as well as in America.
                              In a medium where the music genre is scarce but dominated by Japanese Pop with a few classical and traditional Japanese music stories in between. We do get some black sheep like Beck everyone once in a while that indeed opens a window of fresh air. 
                              I Loved this show, but my rating is coming with a bias, because i basically just watched my life in an anime. I am a musician who has had many bands playing clubs and an arena, so this show was a great watch.
                              Beck tells the story of a young high school student who picks up a guitar and begins a journey of growth, music, and friendship within a rock band.
                              I can honestly say that I have never seen another anime like BECK: Mongolian Chop Squad. Slice-of-life anime is common, of course, but usually it’s that rosy Azumanga Daioh view of high school that resembles real life only in place and time, like a Disney sitcom. The best way to describe this show is that it’s an animated independent film. Except for the patchwork dog and an only slightly far-fetched mobster side-plot near the show’s climax, the series feels grounded not in picturesque reality like a lot of high school slice-of-life, but in the persistently disappointing ennui of real high school life, and the grit          

                              Honestly, I wasn't looking forward to this show. I saw it at a pawn shop for a very cheap price so I went ahead to give a chance. Even after having a friend telling me it pretty much sucks. I must say that it was a whole lot better than I expected. It certainly isn't my favourite but there is something special about it. 
                              Series about young boys searching for themselves and their place in life are not rare by any stretch of the imagination, but ones that really grasp the viewer and provide something more than a simple coming of age story are astoundingly rare. Beck takes the coming of age story and introduces two characteristics which help to distinguish it greatly from other series of its kind: a deep immersion in the world of underground rock, and a deep involvement with its subject matter, which lends emotional weight and a sense of honesty to a tired premise.
                              I never saw a music theme manga or anime until I watched K-On!. Since then, I been hooked to the max for anime like that. I watched some like it and some not like it, but this anime is much more than ""Just like K-ON!"" Its own feel to it, Its uniqueness that called out to me. 
                              Beck is an anime that I have deep respect for since I am a musician myself. This show really does create a sense of what being a rock musician would really be about and it does have some great moments that make this show memorable. Add that to its good music, and spectacular voice acting and characters, Beck comes off as a fantastic show. However, Beck although very good in its ideas, expression, humor, characters, and just overall awesomeness as an anime also makes some aggravating blunders that bother me to no end. Without these blunders or issues, I feel that this anime could have          
                              I am somewhat biased towards this show in a positive way, considering I am a big fan of rock music and I first viewed it when I was not much older than the main character (around 15 or 16). Like Koyuki, I was young, impressionable, and troubled, so that's a major factor into why I love it so much.
                              Oh man what a journey this anime was! I'm sort of mad that I had it on my PTW list for so long, and I'll tell you why. Beck is one of those special anime that reels you in with its relatable characters, and intriguing storyline. I'm really glad that I can put this on my list as my 100th completed anime. Nevertheless, the review:
                              “… RJ label can only produce “feel good” pop tunes, “escapist” music that says everything is alright which just paralyzes people’s consciousness and steals their ability to solve problems that they face in their everyday lives.” – Wao Sato on pop music, Ep 20.

                              From Detective Conan Movies 1 to 15, I like this one the most. The virtual reality concept is interesting and it's set in London which is a nice change. Also includes Jack the Ripper and Sherlock Holmes which made it more interesting. 
                              Although it's taking place inside a VR game, I would have expected quite a bit of mystery from a Detective Conan movie set in the era of Sherlock Holmes. Even more since said game is about investigating the case of Jack the Ripper, one of the great unresolved real-life murder mysteries. But what do we get instead? Conan first goes to Holmes' place (who is currently absent due to his investigation of the Baskerville case), then goes to meet Moriarty, has him kinda summon the culprit, and off we go to the showdown. Bah. Holmes appearing literally out of thin air on the train didn't          
                              This...was...amazing! I have seen a lot of ""Conan"" stories by now and I enjoy them in general. However, they usually feel like ""Here's another somewhat interesting case"" and individual stories often don't stand out.
                              This movie used to be one of my least favorites in the series. Back then, I found it to be weird and somewhat contrived. I understand that this statement may displease some fans. After all, Detective Conan: The Phantom of Baker Street is unarguably a very popular movie among them all and is often considered the best one in the whole series. To this day, I still don't necessarily agree with these opinions. That said, I can finally see why it is that people love this movie so much and why it is still worth recommending to this day.
                              The Phantom of Baker Street has always been one of my favourite Detective Conan movies. I like its characters and story.",201
202,"When Kazuma Satou died, he was given two choices: pass on to heaven or be revived in a fantasy world. After choosing the new world, the goddess Aqua tasked him with defeating the Demon King, and let him choose any weapon to aid him. Unfortunately, Kazuma chose to bring Aqua herself and has regretted the decision ever since then.

Not only is he stuck with a useless deity turned party archpriest, the pair also has to make enough money for living expenses. To add to their problems, their group continued to grow as more problematic adventurers joined their ranks. Their token spellcaster, Megumin, is an explosion magic specialist who can only cast one spell once per day and refuses to learn anything else. There is also their stalwart crusader, Lalatina ""Darkness"" Dustiness Ford, a helpless masochist who makes Kazuma look pure in comparison.

Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo! 2 continues to follow Kazuma and the rest of his party through countless more adventures as they struggle to earn money and have to deal with one another's problematic personalities. However, things rarely go as planned, and they are often sidetracked by their own idiotic tendencies.

                              In the end of Season 1, I thought the story was actually going to go somewhere. But as soon as I was halfway through season 2, I realized nothing really happened to further the story. I thought season 1 to have some potential so I came into season 2 with some expectations. I was pretty disappointed to be honest. 
                              Consistency is hard to find in comedy. Many shows can be funny some of the time, but few can build off their initial success to keep an audience engaged for the long haul. Konosuba avoids the common pitfalls found in its genre by building off the success of season 1, getting even crazier in its lampooning of trapped in another world tropes and continuing to satirize its characters who find creative ways to fail at life.
                              And now, I, the contrarian buzzkill present to you, Kono2ba: A middling, even less funny, and overall lower quality product that actually wants to be taken seriously at times. It fails by its predecessor's standards and it makes me feel like Kazuma. I'll grab the rotten tomatoes...
                              TL;DR: Whether you love comedy or satire, maybe in the mood for some ecchi memes to quench your kinky desires. KonoSuba is your go to parody to complete all your guilty pleasures! 
                              It’s back. 10 episodes of comedic fantasy with Kazuma and the gang. If you’re got a little kid lurking somewhere inside of you, then Konosuba Season 2 is here to please. If you’re familiar with the first season, then expect all the humor to return in full fold. It’s bright. It’s colorful. The plot sounds like it could have been written by someone who was half drunk. But make no mistake about it…Konosuba Season 2 is here again to entertain.
                              The first season of Konosuba was a surprise hit because it had great character interactions, well done comedy, good consistent visuals and a good soundtrack.
                              [Score : 5.0/10]
                              I loved Konosuba season 2.  You get more of the comedy you loved from season 1, plus additional bonuses.
                              The main thing that I want to convey to you is that I really enjoyed this series! It made me laugh a lot in unpredictable ways and I loved the characters. For me is wasn't the type of anime that I thought about in the week between each episode but one that I really enjoyed coming back to each week and was really sad when I realised it only had 10 episodes and I had watched them all. So if you want something chill to watch that will make you laugh this is the show for you!
                              THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR THE 1ST SEASON, PLEASE DO WATCH KONOSUBA'S 1ST SEASON BEFORE READING THIS, UNLESS YOU WANNA GET HEAVY SPOILERS!
                              Konosuba Season 2 is good. Very good. For sure I enjoyed it from the beginning to the end. But reading the novel made me realize the problem I had with both, this and the previous season, and hadn't noticed until now.
                              (That's my first review) This is a review for season one and two of Konosuba
                              The first season and movie I was able to enjoy with my boyfriend, but sadly I adventured into this second season by myself. I'm not the least bit disappointed in this season and had fun watching more adventures with the gain of weirdos.

203,"In 2075, space travel is no longer just a dream, but an everyday reality for mankind. Advancements in science and technology have led to the colonization of the moon, the commercialization of outer space, and the formation of large space corporations. Ai Tanabe, an upbeat woman whose interests lie in the cosmos, joins Technora Corporation as a member of their Debris Section, a department dedicated to the removal of dangerous space junk between the orbits of the Earth and Moon.

However, Ai soon discovers how unappreciated her job is. As the laughingstock of Technora, the Debris Section is severely understaffed, poorly funded, and is forced to use a dilapidated spaceship nicknamed the ""Toy Box"" for debris retrieval. Undeterred, Ai perseveres and gradually becomes acquainted with the strange personalities that make up the Debris Section's staff, such as the bumbling but good-natured chief clerk Philippe Myers; the mysterious and tight-lipped temp worker Edelgard Rivera; and the hotheaded and passionate Hachirouta Hoshino, who longs for a spaceship to call his own.

Planetes is an unconventional sci-fi series that portrays the vastness of space as a backdrop for the personal lives of ordinary people—people who may have been born on Earth, but whose hopes and dreams lie amongst the stars.

How could a show like that possibly be interesting? Well I'm here today to tell you that this is one of the best anime out there, and something everyone should give a try.
                              Growing up, I'm sure many of us have stared into the night sky at one time or another, trying to process the sprawled out abyss, bewildered by its seemingly endless stretches into darkness. Just the very thought of how all-encompassing it is can be equal parts awe-inspiring and intimidating, as we try to find our place in it all. Like our ancestors before us and later generations yet to take our place, us humans have and always will be drawn to the great unknown; like moths to a flame, we pursue things no matter how unsure we may be about the outcome. Always seeking out          
                              Space, the final frontier, and what a frontier it is. Humans long ago looked up at the stars, and reached out to grasp them. From the words of Captain Kirk, ""to boldly go where no man has gone before"". 
                              A Good Anime, but...
                              It is a time... when collecting space debris... is very important! Really seriously business here, guys!
                              The story of PLANETES gets off to a slow start which may put some viewers off, however the slow paced introduction of the characters and their personalities adds a more personal feel to the show, allowing you to get to know the characters as if in real life, finding more and more about them as things progress. As the main storyline begins to develop we are given an even deeper insight into the personal lives of the team aside from their &quot;garbage collector&quot; jobs in outer space, their aspirations for the future and the past that they can't forget. 
                              PLANETES is set in the Year 2075 A.D. when mankind have started fledging their occupancy into the solar system. However, constant travel to and from, between earth and space have started generating debris in the earth and moon's orbits. A space accident caused by the debris, which lead to the deaths of many passengers traveling in a space-shuttle lead to many concerns and for the first time the debris has been considered as a threat in space. Thus 'Debris Section' is made. Debris Section, as the name suggests, is assigned to collect debris to prevent any such tragic incident in the future. 
                              A mature low sci-fi drama set in space?  ""Sign me up!,"" or so I was thinking when I started this series.  Unfortunately, my hopes were dashed within the first episode.  The plot in a nut shell is fine; it's a simple slice of life set in space, musing on various aspects of the human condition.  Zoom in any closer than that, though, and the cracks start to appear.  The show is preachy, to say the least.  Every episode is some vehicle for the author to set up straw men and knock them down to carry a shallow message across.          
                              Director Goro Taniguchi has always been known for his extremely popular and critically acclaimed series, Code Geass. Boasting over 220,000 viewers on this site alone, you’d think that some of his other works would be shed into light because of this popularity. Planetes is a show that flies under the radar for two reasons: the first being that the show, as of this year, is a decade old, and the second reason being that it will always be overlooked by the 10x more popular (literally) Code Geass. 
                              Not often do you stumble across a slice of life having its setting in space itself, being the other worthy title Space Brothers. The idea of human exodus to space will be sooner or later a reality, and with that, debris in its area as well. Planetes narrates the daily life of Garbage Man collecting space debris to ensure a safe environment for all the different modules and ships in Earth's orbit, in addition to expanding on both politics and existentialism of humans related to its exodus. There were some issues with the anime, the comedic elements being the main culprit for hindering its immersion          
                              Reading the synopsis and reviews, I really wanted to like ""Planetes"". Even given how slow the first ten episodes were, I kept hope alive and watched to the end, waiting for the magic which seemed to have charmed so many viewers. There is a lot to be said for the series: its vision for the future is exceptional, for one. Yet in spite of it all, I did not particularly enjoy Planetes and consider it a middling series. Overall, I would recommend giving it a try!
                              This was one of the few anime series I have picked up sight-unseen, based just on reviews in an industry magazine.  Luckily, I was not disappointed. 
                              This is a slow anime in the beggining, in which nothing happens, and too fast paced in the second half, in a way that may confuse one.
                              Coming from a former aeronautical engineering major, space was the first thing that drew me to Planetes, though it wasn’t quite the space exploration anime I was initially thinking it would be.  Nothing flashy here, just the story of a space debris (garbage if you will) collection team and one man’s desire to own his own spaceship to explore space on his own.  However, Planetes had so much more to offer, whether it’s romance, loss, real world comparisons or just great, relatable characters… this show had it all, and it had me eagerly skipping to the next episode and never let me down.          
                              If you are not over 16, do not watch this anime. You will not get the plethora of social, political, psychological, and moral motifs. Plus, it is a bit too heavy hearted. ",203
205,"In the final years of the Bakumatsu era lived a legendary assassin known as Hitokiri Battousai. Feared as a merciless killer, he was unmatched throughout the country, but mysteriously disappeared at the peak of the Japanese Revolution. It has been ten peaceful years since then, but the very mention of Battousai still strikes terror into the hearts of war veterans.

Unbeknownst to them, Battousai has abandoned his bloodstained lifestyle in an effort to repent for his sins, now living as Kenshin Himura, a wandering swordsman with a cheerful attitude and a strong will. Vowing never to kill again, Kenshin dedicates himself to protecting the weak. One day, he stumbles across Kaoru Kamiya at her kendo dojo, which is being threatened by an impostor claiming to be Battousai. After receiving help from Kenshin, Kaoru allows him to stay at the dojo, and so the former assassin temporarily ceases his travels.

Rurouni Kenshin: Meiji Kenkaku Romantan tells the story of Kenshin as he strives to save those in need of saving. However, as enemies from both past and present begin to emerge, will the reformed killer be able to uphold his new ideals?

I looked up the original year expecting to feel old, but somehow 2003 doesn’t seem that long ago. It’s actually almost exactly 13 years. I grew up on this show, and one way or another I’m willing to bet the same could be said of most people still visiting this MAL page. Rurouni Kenshin gave me the hope that I too could be a samurai in a modern world unsuited for one. That hasn’t worked out very well for me.
                              Based on the actual Meiji Period of Japan, Rouruni Kenshin is a Shounen, Action, Adventure about a wandering samurai, &quot;Kenshin&quot;. Even though he is a kind and friendly person, he carries a bloody past he wishes not to return to. This shounen anime starts of like any other as we are introduced to the characters the story revolves around (Kenshin) and we learn quite a bit about them. Also like the typical shounen anime, once all the main characters are together to form some kind of fighting team, it starts of with couple short random adventures. There's plenty of action and comedy here but it          
                              Your deeds of the past is something you won't be able to evade, neither ignore in any way: it will always come back gnawing at you. This is the tale of Himura Kenshin, who once was a ruthless assassin in the past, in his quest of finding redemption from his previous actions. Rorouni Kenshin: Meiji Kenkaku Romantan is a magnificent, well crafted samurai based anime with fantastic characterization and story, which is so rare to find these days. However, it is profoundly clear that the anime falls apart in the last third of its duration, due to fillers.
                              One of the more popular anime of the older generation out there is Rurouni Kenshin. If one is a fan of more of the retro productions or even for the more modern ones, most people have heard of this highly spoken of anime. I myself am more of a modern viewer; however, I gave Rurouni Kenshin a try and was surprised at the depth and entertainment this anime gave.
                              Ahh, ""Rurouni Kenshin"", one of first really long series that I'd watched. A series that at times epitomises the best of fighting shounens while at other times perfectly demonstrates the pitfalls of adapting popular, long running shounen manga.
                              (NO SPOILERS! If you have not seen the Prequel to this anime there will be no spoilers either) 
                              Man its been awhile since i watched this but i recently watched an amv of kenshin and i just felt inspired to write so lol:P
                              Absolutely horrible. I don't know what can make a  series so unwatchable while its OVA and movies were fantastic. The lame excuses of jokes that this anime try to come up with makes you want to hop off a cliff. Kenshin totally does not possess the aura of a fighter but rather a klutz and fails at being funny. Even during the fights, it is just ridiculously stupid. E.g. forgot the name but there was this one villain who has a blade that reeks of the fats of the victims that he slaughtered in the past that when he fights his blade becomes coated

                              Rurouni Kenshin (A) &ndash; in my opinion, THE samurai anime.  It&rsquo;s a series that attempts to blend reality and history with superhuman action and suspense.  It succeeds at being hugely entertaining and almost flawless.
                              The hard part about reviewing this series is if you decide to count the filler arcs as part of the series.  The quality of the story telling between the canon (based on the manga) and the filler (stuff they did to give the manga time to catch up) is radically different.  I've seen both subbed and dubbed episodes but I'm more familiar with the dubbed version so I'll be reviewing that.  I will note that much of the context of what is said in the Japanese version is missing, for which I recommend reading the wikipedia synopsis of this show because it          
                              I was a little hesitant to start this anime but upon one of my closet friend's persistence, I gave in and managed to finish the entire anime within two weeks time (while juggling between school and work). I'm honestly so glad that I gave it a try because it has become one of my all-time favorites and this beautiful work of art truly deserves to be called a masterpiece. Firstly, the plot itself is beautifully written (or drawn) illustrating wanderer Kenshin's journey of saving lives as a form of repentance due to his actions being ""Battousai, the manslayer"" in the war(s) prior to the Meija          
                              This was the first anime I ever watched back when I was like 8 and I remember totally falling in love with Kenshin’s swordsmanship ways. Therefore now I am older, I decided to rewatch it to see whether I felt the same amasement as I once felt as a child.",205

Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata have both produced some of the most imaginative works ever put to the animation medium, and their genius efforts show in most of their creations. Add in to the fact that Joe Hisaishi is one of the best soundtrack composers in all of Anime, and you’ve got yourself a trio that has produced works that were nearly perfect in every sense of the word. Unfortunately, a group of professionals          
                              I know this movie is almost 30 years old, but I recently re-watched it and I cried reminiscing about my childhood and thought I should write my first review on it. Tenkuu no Shiro Laputa aka Castle in the Sky is tied as my favorite Miyazaki movie alongside Princess Mononoke; my 2 favorite movies as a child.
                              Castle in the sky is the third film made by Hayao Miyazaki, who I've come to believe is one of the most masterful storytellers. The story is based on the Laputa of Gulliver's Travels, a floating city of scientists and ideologist, which is a legend, a dream of explorers. The young miner Pazu in the story has a goal, which is to find Laputa just as his father did before. And one day, a girl Sheeta who is wearing a magical necklace drifting down from the sky into Pazu's arms, their adventure begins.  
                              Studio Ghibli is arguably one of the greatest anime film studios of all time, setting the standard for Japanese animation many times over since its inception. They are responsible for producing some of the best animated films ever seen; blessing anime fans with several classic films over the decades and creating countless spectacles along with them, many of which were made under the guidance of legendary director and Studio Ghibli founder, Hayao Miyazaki. Together, their library includes the likes of Howl’s Moving Castle, Princess Mononoke, and of course the Academy Award-winning Spirited Away. But before all that, the studio giant had to begin somewhere. And          
                              'Laputa: Castle in the Sky' is incredibly similar to a much loved TV series from years gone by called 'Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water'... which is hardly shocking when you consider that Miyazaki, the director of Laputa, came up with the idea that later became Nadia!
                              I feel like the studio and Director would be a give away that this would be good. I don’t know what to fully talk about as everything about this show is amazing from the story to the animation to the dub. Even the comedy doesn’t get in the way of the great story that lies within this show. Only one or two things bother me but they aren’t that big, like when Pazu jumps off his house and ends up breaking through bricks into his basement with no broken bones or nothing. Of course, these problems are minor and don’t happen all that much.
                              This was my first anime EVER and my gateway to the anime world. So I have a very high respect for it in those regards. 
                              When I originally watched ""Laputa: Castle in the Sky"", it felt pretty similar to the rest of Miyazaki's works, but now that I'm older, watched more of his films and more anime in general and written more reviews, I've come to realise that it does contain quite a few elements that are not the norm for his other works.
                              Laputa is notable among long-time anime fans as being the first official Studio Ghibli film made in 1986. This steampunk fantasy-adventure film focuses on our main pairing of Pazu and Sheeta seeking out the whereabouts of the mysterious land in the sky, Laputa, while evading both a gang of sky pirates and members of the military seeking Sheeta to guide them to Laputa for their own varying ends.
                              Miyazaki's Masterpiece.
                              This is Hayao Miyazaki’s second major movie after Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind (he also did Castle of Cagliostro but that is just a Lupin the 3rd side story so I don’t count it as major). This time he went for something much lighter than a grim post-apocalyptic setting; it is a lot more conventional and easy-going so I hardly enjoyed it as much as Nausicaa.
                              In the early 1980s, a man named Hayao Miyazaki was just hot off the success of one of his first animated features, Nausicaa and the Valley of the Wind. With all the money that came in thanks to Nausicaa's success, he decided to make his own company. With lots of hard work and help from friends, namely Isao Takahata and Toshio Suzuki, Studio Ghibli was born. The first movie Ghibli ever made was this one, Laputa: Castle In The Sky, or just Castle In The Sky, since Laputa is apparently an offensive Spanish slur, not that the producers knew that at the time. From all          
                              This is what started it all for me.

In spite of staying true to the manga to an extent, the original TV series was shameless in it's amateur art styl, jilted animation, and wholly uneven pacing. Fans got a brief look at something amazing when the short movie came out and wondered, &quot;what if Production I.G. did the canon story of Tsubasa?&quot;
                              Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicles was a great series in and of itself. It was portrayed in the anime in a very hit or miss fashion  with the quality and editting. The way Bee Train hurt Tsubasa is the equivalent of what 4kids does to anime here. Be that as it may, we're not talking about the original 2 seasons, i'm here to recommend to you.
                              Let me start off by saying I am among a minority of critics that feels the Anime series is a work of misunderstood genius and I'm probably the only one who's tired of the Bee Train haterz because OCD CLAMP fans can't stand anything that's different from the Manga.  That's not to say I don't recognize the flaws in Bee Train's TV anime series, but nothing is with out it's flaws.   With Tokyo Revelations being picked up by Production I.G from BEE TRAIN I wasn't sure what to really expect.
                              Tsubasa Chronicle: Tokyo Revelations did what the rest of the anime series failed to do: be interesting. While the art style is more or less the same, it is obvious in the first few minutes that it has been supplemented with greater detail, some additional special effects here and there, and the animation seems to move more smoothly and remain more &quot;active&quot;, versus the all-too-boring and sluggish feel of Tsubasa Chronicle and Tsubasa Chronicle 2nd Season.
                              I believe that Tsubasa Chronicle Tokyo Revelations was a fabulous continuation, giving us a clearer insight into the background of all the characters and the plot. For those who are slightly confused while having watched Tsubasa so far, these OVA's are of an extreme help in painting a more 'clearer' picture of the story in general. It explains so much, while still providing us with even MORE surprises to keep our minds wheeling with excitement and curiosity. Compared to the seasons before, the artwork is exceptionally better and I also believe that the climax of the story still has yet to reach its peak. The

                              ONLY for those who are already familiar with Tsubasa and even then probably only for those who have read the manga or have done some looking into outside of just watching the anime. Otherwise, you'll have little to no clue what is going on. 
                              This OVA was absolutely... AMAZING!
                              Tsubasa Chronicles: Tokyo Revelations is a three part movie
                              Tsubasa: Tokyo Revelations was pretty special at times, it had the kind of CLAMP magic that you see in various other media by them, such as Magic Knight Rayearth, Cardcaptor Sakura, or even Code Geass. 
                              We're not in Kansas anymore.
                              As a fan Tsubasa, this was a little too irresistible to keep from picking up. I was pretty happy in the end. If you haven't watched Tsubasa before, or if you don't know much about it (even just having seen the first season), I strongly recommend you don't watch this. There would be very little sense to it, and a lot of piecing together scraps of information.
                              How can something so simple become so complicated? This will be my first thought while watching Tokyo Revelations...
                              In my mind, the animation was better than in the first seasons. I have to admit, that some scenes were unfortunately not able to keep up with the rest (third OVA: Fay looked like a fish desperately longing for air O.o). Nonetheless the storyline was very interesting and not so easy to understand, which I find very exciting.

How can I say? I wasn't really unpleasant... but a bit stubborn. However, don't imagine that I was arguing. If only ... on the contrary, I didn't say anything, and I preferred to get away from them. I couldn't express myself correctly with the others and I didn't dare to reproach them for fear of hurting them. None of us tried to understand each other and we ended up moving away and taking different ways.
                              Spring 2015 was a heavy season. Out of all the shows though, there was one particular that stood out and it’s Hibike Euphonium (Sound Euphonium). Produced by one of the highest quality anime studios ever, the show is still much more than an eye candy fest. So when I heard the series was returning for a sequel, I was ecstatic. Hibike Euphonium 2 is like a gift that keeps on giving.
                              As a person who loves listening to most genre of music ranging from classic to hardcore metal, dub-step to jazz, I can strongly recommend this anime to everyone regardless of their anime preferences or music taste. To be honest, it has much more potential than most music anime until date. Hibike! Euphonium can definitely inspire viewers on so many levels because this gem reflects and portrays so many state of human emotion in a spectacular fashion.
                              Hibike! Euphonium: Wholehearted Sincerity
                              School is the perfect location for coming of age stories. It's a shame that this potential is little utilized. Thankfully, Hibike is an exception. It's an anime with chewed to death school settings, with clichéd competition aspect, that manages to be a fresh breath of air. Hibike is a well-told simple story.
                              After the disappointing third season of Haikyuu!! I was hoping that Hibike Euphonium would atleast have a good second season that I would've enjoyed. Unfortunately I was wrong. Although not as broken as Haikyuu!! S3, Hibike Euphonium season 2 was still a very disappointing sequel to what was otherwise a great first season.
                              I have a feeling that there will be those who want to give this anime a perfect 10/10 but perhaps will shy away because of the great divide in the community. So, here I am. Writing a review for an anime which I thought not only needs to be properly addressed as to why it should be considered a masterpiece but demands a standing ovation in the way it has executed almost everything to perfection.
                              The second season of Hibike! Euphonium, in my opinion, is better than the first. This season feels like a more refined and concentrated version of what Hibike! Euphonium is, and that improvement alone turns a good anime into a great anime.
                              Band has becoming a dying medium as the importance of academics and becoming a top student have gained importance.  It's come to the point that many schools have cut off art programs like these entirely simply because they either no longer have the budget to support it, or see it as something that has no real importance in students' lives.  So, at the time of this review, while we still have the concept of the school band alive, we return back to KyoAni's adaptation of Hibike! Euphonium, the drama-filled band with aspirations as big as their sound.
                              Hibike!Euphonium an enjoyable yet a smart approach to the beauty of wind orchestra and the musician's soul that aims to shine brightly among all the other orchestra members.This anime really made me fall in love for the first time with Trumpet, Euphonium & Oboe And made me fall in love again with classical music. I can not forget also the personalities of our characters that take us in this beautiful ride throughout the anime.And as always our KyoAni's aesthetic unique animation.The plot is great, the music is a cherry on top and the whole anime is deserved to be watched again & again.
                              A Sound! Euphonium 2 Review
                                           Sequels are like a double-edged sword. For the good shows, the creators are always under immense pressure to replicate the success from the first season, but if done correctly, will be able to grow the cult following for an even bigger profit. For the bad shows, though there are no such expectations, the need to create a series to a non-existent fan base is illogical. Hibike! Euphonium season 1 was in the middle of the spectrum, dwarfed by the popularity and sales of the likes of K-ON while still having sales and          
                              You know that awkward moment when all the yuri shipping you did made people think you made a LGBT anime to the point that Crunchyroll had to tweet about it?
                              Hibike Euphonium 2 gives you the same thing you’ve come to expect by this point – high school lesbians playing brass instruments, if you liked it then, you’ll like it now, the story, and the presentation of that story remains rather unchanged, and so, there is rather little for me to actually say about it. It is more of the same - it looks the same, it sounds the same, and it overall feels the same, which isn’t a bad thing by any means, considering that last time around it looked, sounded and felt great, and I can respect a studio that understands the value

                              If you're a fan of the first season of Dr. Stone, then you have to give the second season a try. The second season picks up right where the first season stopped and is full of action since the first episode. All our favourite characters are back, including the quirky ones (isn't this almost all of them? haha). The animation is still on par with the first season as well as the sound and general approach to the series.
                              Preliminary review:
                              I know this review might be a bit cotroversial. I also do know that it will be impossible for me to properly convey my feelings and throughts about this show with words as I simply lack the experience writing reviews.
                              Dr.Stone comes back at it again with a second season. At the time of writing this review, the first four episodes were really good and I know that the rest won’t disappoint. 
                              Have you ever dreamed of Going into the past With a couple of your modern gadgets? That's practically impossible unless you have a time machine. But if you had dreams like that i am sure you would love this series.But the catch is  instead of going to the past The Protagonists go to the future where Humans are extinct and everything is green.Let me correct myself instead of the protagonists going to the future we can say that all of the living Humans in Earth have been turned into non aging statues But it is the protagonist who is First to become normal AND          
                              I'm only writing a review for season 2 just because it honestly has gotten 100% better.
                              Dr. Stone is back, and it's back with a bang. It truly is, as if it never left the season it aired, and continues onward in it's entertaining scientific fun. Let me explain why.",212

Some classics are pioneers that introduce novel ideas that are then further improved upon by later works. Other classics are timeless masterpieces that define entire genres as the gold standard; Ghost in the Shell isn't something that is able to meet that standard. The overly simplistic philosophical narrative of GITS just doesn't hold up very well in modern times while other classical pieces have. Ghost in the Shell is a movie driven by concept, a concept that is shown, not told, in a slow, vague approach that requires attention, thought, and          
                              Ah...Ghost In The Shell.  I'm writing this JUST after finishing it.  If you watched the original Matrix and went &quot;Holy Jesus this is the most amazing movie i've ever seen IN MY LIFE&quot; then Ghost in the Shell will dropkick you in the face. Seriously.
                              I took the time watching the highly acclaimed Ghost in the Shell, which is pretty famous for its philosophical and thought-provoking themes.
                              So I finally saw this movie. I've seen both seasons of Stand Alone Complex, Solid State Society, and Innocence, but I hadn't seen the original until now. And you know what? I'm kind of disappointed.
                              Story- 9/10
                              This movie is great, if you want to watch fucking nothing happen for over an hour. I kept thinking, ""when does the action start?"", but it never did. The plot is a trainwreck; trying to connect a series of non sequiturs does not make for something interesting. The art was -OK- for a film from the 90s but I personally did not like the style. Music plays an important role in setting the mood for any presentation but you do not get that with this movie. Instead, you get a bunch of wailing that you're expected to enjoy. Other than that, sound effects were nothing          
                              “If you don’t know where you’re from, then you don’t know where you are, and you don’t know where you’re going.” It’s a clichéd if truthful saying, especially for this film. Well, sort of. This film knows where it’s going, but it doesn’t know how to get there, it doesn’t know where it is, and it doesn’t know where it’s from. This film is a voice pining to speak, but it studders at every word.
                              I watched this two times and fell asleep both times.
                              Based on the manga of the same name by Masamune Shirow, Ghost in the Shell is an account of a not-so-distant future when it’s not uncommon for you to walk on a busy street and bump into cyborgs— humans who have been ‘cyberized’ to such an extent that every aspect of their functioning is taken care of by high-tech equipment within their ‘shell’, the prosthetic body, and ‘ghost’ which is the slang term for consciousness. So what was it that you really bumped into? What is it that differentiates a human from a cyborg? What makes us human— the biological matter, the consciousness or the          
                               ‘’And can you offer me proof of your existence? How can you, when neither modern science nor philosophy can explain what life is?’’
                              I find ""Ghost in the Shell"" just as a concept AMAZING. The combination of the this idea of what  the world could be like in 2029 and the psychological game that this story plays as you move through the movie.
                              Ghost in the Shell is one of the reasons(besides akira) animes became so populare in america and in europe, because it shows how anime are suppost to be. This isnt a commercial product full of clichees and overused artstlye-types, its a beautiful masterpiece of art. But this anime is not made for everyone. It is made to appeal to mature audience, since the majority of anime ( and nearly ever recent made anime) is for teenagers or children, i would suggest you think about it twice before you just randomly start watching this anime, else you will just get confused.
                              I’ve seen Ghost in the Shell 6 years ago and I hated it.
                              Ghost In The Shell - 5/10
                              The 1995 Ghost in the Shell Movie had an interesting setting and concept, but very poor execution. The first 20 minutes of the movie didn't grab my interest, it didn't established why should I care about the characters and the story. The characters are presented badly, they are very bland and uninteresting. There is a modicum of time or no time given to show the viewers the important characters' intentions, backgrounds and personalities.",216

                              Ah Redline, what words can I use to describe this epic adrenaline rush? To be honest words are not enough, this is one of those films that you have to see to fully comprehend its greatness. However I am going to attempt to pass on my thoughts of this film in this review of what feel is one of the best anime films I have ever seen. Period.
                              Someone showed the Japan­ese ‘Wacky Races’. They were not impressed. “They call this ‘wacky’?”, they said. “We’ll show them wacky”.
                              If Redline was to be described in one word, 'explosive' would be it. This off-the-wall animated racing movie is overflowing with zany antics, over-the-top characters, and logic-defying awesomeness. It doesn't have a complex story, and offers next to nothing for the thinking viewer, but that is obviously not its aim. Redline is a stunning display of visual brilliance, a reminder that the reason we love animation is that it can pull off things that are too ridiculous and outrageous to be accomplished in live action. It is the pinnacle of style over substance.
                              Ah, Redline, the industry’s loudest bomb. A bomb so explosive, so meticulously crafted and vibrant that its aftershocks can still be felt today from all sides of the spectrum, from the painful lack of risks maligned in today’s time, to the cult following that spawned from the ashes. A decade later, and the film’s still one of the biggest spectacles in the business, so it may have just won in the end.
                              “Life’s overrated” – JP
                              *This is my first review, I'm trying a structured format, please do not hesitate to give me feedback by profile comment (or PM)*
                              Way back at the turn of the century a short OVA series was released that went by the name “Trava”. It was a quirky series that was noted mostly for its visual style. The think bold shadows and lines were very much not unlike those of a comic book and it sported some very interesting and experimental animation. It was co-directed by Takeshi Koike, who instead of going on to direct some more anime seemingly stuck in the background and directed bits and pieces of animation here and there. More specifically, he was also behind the Afro Samurai promo, a section of the Animatrix and          
                              Redline is the pinnacle of what every racing movie inspires to be, fast paced, high octane, absolutely insane, and stunningly beautiful. It does this while all being set to one of my favorite anime soundtracks, so good that it rivals those of FLCL, Cowboy Bebop, Madoka, Attack on Titan, Kill la Killa, and the Monogatari Series (as well as anything else that I missed).
                              I'll give credit to Redline that it made for quite the impressive achievement in animation as it was completely animated by hand, which is unheard of these days with computers essentially being used to create all of the animation used for modern anime titles. The movie was brimming with plenty of detail and depth in depicting the violent races that took place in the movie and showing off the scenery of Roboworld as the racers prepared and raced on the planet's surface. The animation depth was slick enough to create the illusion of speedy movement depicted with the racers and any collateral damage coming from          
                              Redline: A Personal Statement
                              Shows that utilize their audio-visual appeal in their own, unique way tend to fly under the radar of most people, if what they are trying to do would be more unconventional and be properly placed in an “artsy” section, but gaining reasonable critical acclaim and a steady increase in popularity the more time passes (e.g. Kaiba and Mononoke). In contrast to that, shows like Bebop and Mushishi’s audio-visuals take a much more grounded route. Their artistical appeal mostly derives from the colour palette and incredible attention to detail, not screwing around with the general ideas of the body structure in fiction and creating a world          
                              ""Redline"" is a film of style. It is a simple story that doesn't take itself too seriously. But this piece is truly art, you could watch it for that reason alone.
                              Let me be frank: No automotive film will ever surpass the experience you will have while watching this. Not even if Top Gear released a movie (although it'd be funnier).
                              Hey, you want to know an anime taking place throughout the far reaches of space that I recently returned to? Redline. I’ve been pruning down my favorites anime list recently, taking out things to ensure that only the best of the best stayed on, and I was curious about whether I’d still enjoy Madhouse’s visual popcorn masterpiece – as oxymoronic as that may sound.

The institution is famous for its ""Shokugeki"" or ""food wars,"" where students face off in intense, high-stakes cooking showdowns.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.29,8,237,51,1184171,21998,"                              Sorry everyone, I honestly don't know why this show is so highly ranked as it is.
                              Shokugeki no Souma also goes by the name, Food Wars. However, I’d like to call it more as Food Gasm. The reason being is that the character reactions to food is not what you may expect. Or maybe you will once you see how ridiculously delicious the food actually is. What this show brings forth to the table is more than just a delicious meal though. Shokugeki no Souma is a satirical battle shounen that emphasizes more than just cooking. 
                              Imagine that you have a typical tournament-based battle shounen. Now replace the fighting... with food porn. The result is basically Shokugeki no Souma.
                              One positive thing I can say about Shokugeki no Souma is that it's an anime that knows exactly what it is - a ridiculously over-the-top sports/battle shounen with cooking as the centerpiece.
                              Shokugeki no Souma actually surprised me, i was really with the foot back if i would watch it or not but it ended up being very good.
                              (This has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)
                              Anime and manga are known to have the potential to make a subject that for most audiences is uninteresting to a compelling, enjoyable experience: such is the case of cooking. This theme has been explored before with less succesful titles such as ""Koufuku Graffiti"" or ""Bonjour Koiaji Patiesere"", but with Shokugeki no Soma it seems to have a huge success among the audiences, but why? 
                              This anime is a disappointment.I'm a big fan of the manga and was thoroughly saddened by this poor adaption.
                              Shokugeki no Souma. . . Where do I begin with this show? Well, let's start with the common description that's been drifting around the internet since its airing-- ""Food Porn"". It's an understandable title, really. Every episode features numerous mouth watering dishes that we the audience can't help but lust after. With most (if not all) episodes also featuring a foodgasm it's an apt moniker. That may cause some misconceptions however. By that description alone you may assume this to just be another throw away ecchi show. I won't lie, I had similar thoughts after the first episode that featured a truly terrifying scene involving          
                              Shokugeki No Souma or FOOD WARS is the number 1 ecchi/comedy/shounen of all time, period.
                              Culinary prowess has taken a decently large foothold in the world that we know today.  With many a aspiring chef coming to showcase their culinary chops, we follow the story today of an anime character named Souma, and his road to culinary greatness in, Shokugeki no Souma, Food Wars!  Let's dig in!
                              I honestly went blind into this anime and had no idea what to expect well except for food. But, my reason for continuing to watch this show was because of I can’t believe I am saying this – the parts where people become stark naked and have orgasms from the food they eat. Not to mention, that the tentacle porn like scenes also made me question how this show would go down. No kidding!
                              Before watching Shokugeki, I did not know how to cook. After watching Shokugeki, I don’t know shit about food at all.
                              THIS REVIEW DOES NOT HAVE ANY SPOILERS. Alright so, before writing this review I did watch until the end of the series and this review basically answers this question - Why should you watch Food wars? or Why did I rate Food wars 10? or what's good about it. I divided it into sections.

",8.29,8,238,747,200359,1738,"                              What else can I say... This movie had a great storyline, a huge unexpected twist near the ending, held mystery from the very beginning, had very witty humor (I caught myself laughing out loud many times), characters were well introduced, it was rather heartwarming as well, family-focused, gives definition to what life truly is, pacing and story progression was really good, art was outstanding, I really have to say that I enjoyed this movie A LOT. Made me remember the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Future but twisted it up a bit. This was a remarkable movie. I recommend it to everyone. I added          
                              I watch Tokyo Godfathers every Christmas. It's a fantastic Christmas movie, but it's not just a Christmas movie. It's also a fantastic family movie and a fantastic auteur film. It's Satoshi Kon's greatest movie, out of the few films he was able to make in his lifetime.
                              From the creator of Perfect Blue comes Tokyo Godfathers.
                              Satoshi Kon is widely considered an auteur of bizarre masterpieces. Perfect Blue, Paprika, and Millennium Actress are all strange, high-concept films to varying degrees. However, Tokyo Godfathers might somehow be his oddest film. This isn't due to the film taking the concepts of blurring reality and fiction to insane new levels while incorporating even crazier ideas. The film barely even touches the idea, and it barely even mentions the concept of film in any way. These are two of the greatest hallmarks of a Satoshi Kon movie, and they're largely absent. Therefore, this film is the biggest risk the late director had taken as it          
                              The holiday season is finally here, and with the holidays always come the festivities. Shopping, spending time with family, decorating the Christmas tree, cuddling with loved ones alongside the soft embers of the fireplace: these are all the ideals of a perfect Christmas. After all, there's nothing more to love about Christmas than the gifts or the food, right? Well, maybe if you're a middle-aged salaryman. To our three protagonists, they'd just be happy if they could find a leftover bottle of booze in Tokyo's garbage dumps. 
                              This movie is definitely a slow one to start out, but then it gets faster and more interesting towards the end.  Still, this movie is not the greatest ever, definitely not the greatest.
                              Tokyo Godfathers is a film directed by Kon Satoshi, who also directed the superb Perfect Blue, and co-written by Wolf's Rain creator, Nobumoto Keiko. With animation and production from Madhouse, whether it's the branch of Madhouse that ruins action scenes with random T & A shots or the branch that does stellar work remains to be seen. Yes, I have become convinced that Madhouse has one division to do animation for quality projects like Rainbow, Monster and the aforementioned Perfect Blue and another for their drek projects like Highschool of the Dead or Devil Hunter Yohko. Although in reality they probably have a lot more          
                              Critic’s Log - Earthdate: December 1, 2013. Review #72: Tokyo Godfathers.
                              I just sort of randomly requested this from my library on a whim, knowing what it was about but not quite sure what to expect. 
                              ""Tokyo Godfathers"" is a Christmas film. Tradition dictates that these films should contain elements such as light hearted comedy and family oriented themes. And that exactly the kind of film ""Tokyo Godfathers"" strives to be. 
                              It's a Christmas miracle!
                              Tokyo Godfathers is a rather unique film from Satoshi Kon as it differs from his other works in that the movie is not as heavy on the cerebral side. Set in Tokyo during the holiday season, the movie focuses on a trio of homeless people from different walks of life who come across an abandoned baby and journey throughout the city to learn of the whereabouts of the baby's parents. While doing this, each of these people come to grips with their tragic pasts as the movie explores the varying circumstances that led each of our main trio to wind up living on the streets.
                              Tokyo Godfathers is a work by Satoshi Kon, produced by Madhouse and was released in 2003. It is an original story set in the not-so-beautiful setting of Tokyo and deals with the themes of abandonment and family.
                              STORY: Overall, the story was pretty good. I find that altogether the story is pretty heartwarming, and pretty easy to understand. One thing that disappointed me was that, in the end, an event takes place, (I wont mention how far towards the end, or who), that really leaves you hanging, mainly because a lot of this is going on during the main story. Other than that the story was great!  
                              Well...Hmmm.. Tokyo godfather. What can I say?  ",220
223,"Kaiji Itou is a good-for-nothing loiterer who spends his days drinking beer and stealing hubcaps—that is, until he ends up being tricked by his former co-worker. Unable to suddenly repay his friend's huge debt all by himself, Kaiji is offered a shady deal to participate in an illegal underground gamble on a cruise ship. This turns out to be nothing more than the beginning of his new life of hell—thrown headlong into a life-threatening roller coaster of mind games, cheating, and deceit.

Based on the first entry of the famous gambling manga series by Nobuyuki Fukumoto, Gyakkyou Burai Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor follows our unlucky protagonist as he is forced to fight not only other people, but also the mysteries of their psyches. Kaiji finds out the hard way that the worst sides of human nature surface when people's backs are against the wall, and that the most fearsome dangers of all are greed, paranoia, and the human survival instinct itself.

                              Kaiji, maybe is one of the genius anime that would be rarely be consumed these days. Many reasons for it, like people these days are just loooking for anime which have cute girls (or we can said seeking for MOE). Cant blame on it since anime industry now are using cute girls for their sales and of course for seeking profit.  Anyway, there is no cute girls in Kaiji so please step out if you’re looking for it. But honestly you would miss a show that would make hold your breath from the beginning to the end.
                              Edit: added more stuff and reworded some things
                              Many say that slow Anime series are always the boring ones, and they might be right in what they say, because who has the nerve and patience to sit through a twenty minute length of an episode with barely any action and dialogue that keeps being shoved into their faces? This is what people usually think of when they think of slow paced Anime series: No excitement, no intriguing arcs and no endearing characters. All in all, most people think that slow paced Anime series are not enjoyable, until they watch Kaiji Ultimate Survivor. Kaiji Ultimate Survivor proves that a series that relies heavily on          
                              What happens when you take the &quot;No one win's but I&quot; attitude and you place it into the hands of a bunch of desperate, shameless losers?  Why, you get Kaiji of course!
                              I chose to write a review about this anime because people have to know how good it is.
                              Kaiji Ultimate Survivor explores human vices, the temptation of evil & the shattering of hope all through the usage of gambling. Kaiji is a psychological thriller building much tension as Kaiji's thoughts on society & goodwill are put into question.
                              Kaiji was a very interesting series for me, in that I found it to be so incredibly hit-or-miss, it's difficult to review.
                              With the various 10’s all dominating the top reviews for Kaiji on MAL, I found it even more necessary to get a review written of my own for this series.  Gyakkyou Burai Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor is an anime focusing on suspense and intense twists and turns along the way of its storytelling.  This series had me on the edge of my seat at times, but I became bored with it at others due to certain segments being drawn out longer than necessary.  Let’s break down each section individually.
                              Kaiji isn’t a mainstream series like Naruto or Bleach. If your high school has an anime club and that is where you hear about the series you watch, then you probably haven’t heard of Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor. However, if you spend time on MAL and read through suggestions, you have probably at least heard of Kaiji as a sophisticated and highly lauded work. I will be examining this 2007 anime that is already widely viewed as a timeless classic. Instead of my usual format, I will be breaking the review into pros and cons because Kaiji is a special series, so I figure it deserves          
                              This series does not get alot of love. If you don't enjoy enjoy thinking alot about your anime, you will not like this.
                              Kaiji is another gambling series done by the same people who made Akagi. If you happened to read my review on Akagi, you will notice how disappointed I was. But the same cannot be said about Kaiji. This time the producers realized their mistakes and fixed it. Now, this is a gambling series done right. Thumbs up.
                              Kaiji is an anime you would probably avoid at first glance. To be honest, I did too when I first saw it. It stayed in the back of my mind for a few months until a friend told me it was great and I found out that the artist and creator was Korean. So, with a bit of reluctance, I started viewing Kaiji and I was blown away. The artstyle quickly became very enjoyable and I didn't mind the pointy noses or weird eyes after the first episode. If you are avoiding this anime due to the odd artstyle, do yourself a favor and stop          
                              First off, the reason that I am writing this review is that I feel this series is too overrated, the two current reviews here are both exemplary of that.
                              Murphy's Law, whatever can go wrong WILL go wrong. This is the basic premise surrounding almost any anime related to games. As you watch a show like Kaiji, you already know that over the course of whatever game they are playing, things will go badly. The key to these shows it to surprise you anyway, to be caught off guard by the things that go wrong, and to be impressed when the good guys overcome the odds. ",223

The son of a tofu shop owner, he is tasked to deliver tofu every morning without fail, driving along the mountain of Akina. Thus, conversations regarding cars or driving in general would only remind Takumi of the tiring daily routine forced upon him.

One night, the Akagi Red Suns, an infamous team of street racers, visit the town of Akina to challenge the local mountain pass. Led by their two aces, Ryousuke and Keisuke Takahashi, the Red Suns plan to conquer every racing course in Kanto, establishing themselves as the fastest crew in the region. However, much to their disbelief, one of their aces is overtaken by an old Toyota AE86 during a drive back home from Akina. After the incident, the Takahashi brothers are cautious of a mysterious driver geared with remarkable technique and experience in the local roads—the AE86 of Mount Akina.

Takumi is forcibly encouraged by his coworkers and friends into putting his racing abilities to the test in order to defend Akina’s hometown pride.

                              I like watching sports anime. People who know me and have accepted the fact that I am a hardcore couch-potato find this hilarious. But the irony doesn't end there. I am a member of minority who does not possess a driving license nor has the faintest clue about driving. 
                              I just finished this series and I KNEW I had to review it right away! Holy shit this series was a trip! Initial D is a series that everyone has heard of, but not as many people have actually watched it. It's not in the top 600 most viewed series on MAL, yet it's somehow so famous that non-anime fans know about it. We all know it's that racing anime with the CHEESIEST OST in existence that spawned all those memes. It's also one of the only pre-2000 series in the MAL top 250. The others are all series like Rose of Versailles, Galactic Heroes,          
                              At first, I&rsquo;ll admit that I did not think I would like the concept at first, but other factors which I will further elaborate on would keep on pulling me into this franchise and would like it more and more. I know it&rsquo;s not the most exciting or appealing anime, and that I&rsquo;m not the biggest gear head, but I felt something special about this one. Even though Takumi is not exactly the most appealing anime character of all time, it&rsquo;s kind of weird that his lack of charisma in some ways makes him charismatic at the same time because he does all his talking          
                              ""Initial D is a good series. Please give it a try. Don't let it die as a ""good meme"", it deserves more than that."" - some random ass dude in the youtube comments. 
                              Vroom Vroom, if you're into street racing then you'll love initial D. Tak is so gosh darn thicc and irresistible, and my homeboy Shingo can hit a drift faster than anybody can smack that nae nae. Whevever my homeboy Tak does a drift everyone goes zoo wee mama, including me. Bunta is smarter than any Rick and Morty and he smokes really cool. Because of him i've become a heavy smoker and my life expectancy has gone down to 30 years. My boy itsuki sucks at drifting, but he is such a qt π and he does the most epic fails xD. Overall, I'd give          
                              Yeah, this is one of those shows that have a niche audience that I'm not gonna have interest in continuing further with. I've heard quite a bit about Initial D since college where it was popular with street racing fans and even served as a gateway drug to anime for some. It even gets poked fun of for its subpar animation in some comedy anime like Lucky Star and School Rumble, which I'll cover a little later in this review.
                              A friend told me about this Series, the other day. I was skeptical when he explained what it was about. He said it was about street racing and mainly about the cars. To be honest, I am not all that interested in cars. I am like the next person and have a mediocre interest, but not enough where I would be overly excited to watch a series about cars. 
                              To start off this review, I have to say; the saying ""it's not for everybody"" has never been more accurate for anime.  As a huge car enthusiast, I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed this anime and finished it in only two days (first stage).  Because most cars are automatic nowadays, most people won't have any idea about how manuals work or even about the lost art of double clutching or toe/heel techniques.  Seeing little things like this was totally nostalgic and made the show just that much better for me.
                              First Stage review
                              Takumi Fujiwara is an average 18-year old high school student with an average job as a gas station attendant, and a not-so-average hand in the family business. To help his father's tofu shop, Takumi has been delivering tofu in his father's 'Eight-Six' Trueno to a hotel at the peak of Mt. Akina. Every night at 4 a.m. He's is brought into a world full of street racing and eventually over time feels compelled to become the best drift racer in all of tokyo. He is soon plunged into a world of competition and contests against some of the greatest racers in the japan prefecture.
                              So its pretty clear I am a fan of anime due to being on this website and of course I am a fan of cars. Combine the both and you have a recipe for success! It surprises me how a simple story about street racing can be so good! 
                              Let me state first off all that I don't really like cars that much. My dad likes it a lot and frankly, I still don't know why. Even now, after watching the series, it hasn't increased my interest in racing. So one would think that a guy like me, a guy completely oblivious to racing, would drop a show like this immediately.
                              Just finished Initial D, and I have to say it was a wild ride, it was a lot of fun. The races were pretty much the only attraction to this show, but they were filled with a lot of hype, tension and excitement. Just watching the cool drifting and thinking about how a certain character was going to win was a lot of fun, the racing was great. 
                              ""Initial D"" is a good sports anime about racing and definitely worth watching. The high school story is rather boring as it has been done many times and much better, but the racing aspect of this show is unique, pulls in watchers, and will get your heart racing.  The animation is an older style and not as fluid as it is from 1998, however the older character designs are a refreshing change from the near identical character designs of many current anime.  Also the racing scenes are in CG so that may be off putting to some.  As I have not watched          ",224
225,Music video for the song Kawaki wo Ameku by Minami.,8.28,8,241,3921,17409,171,"                              The song is remarkable but the visuals generic, flat and boring. As music VIDEOS go it deserves better. The OP this song comes from (Domestic Kanojo) while not fantastic either is way more visually interesting; it's rather unfortunate that the OP doesn't portray the entire song. This is not a music review site it's an ANIME site so I'm not sure if you expected for me to judge it on the basis of the music alone when the entire point of this video seems to be the creation of visuals that complement the song. Well it at the very least ""moves"" to the music in          
                              I have already stated this in my Domestic Girlfriend anime review, but since it's clear that vast majority of users have not read it, I will repeat myself: Its opening song is easily the best song from Winter 2019 anime lineup. I was surprised to find out that its full version, 'Kawaki wo Ameku' -- now with its own animated music video -- had a separate entry on MAL database where it had also slowly risen to the top 100 anime list in a short time. But even more so, I was surprised to agree with the consensus on how well-made it is.

With the end of the battle, however, comes the time for each of them to go their separate ways. Hakuryuu and Kougyoku are ordered to go back to their home country, the Kou Empire. Meanwhile Aladdin announces he needs to head for Magnostadt—a mysterious country ruled by magicians—to investigate the mysterious events occurring in this new kingdom and become more proficient in magic.

                              Note: I'm writing this review under the assumption that you've seen Labyrinth of Magic (the first season), so if you haven't, I'd suggest watching that first and then reading this review. There will be minor spoilers from the first season. You have been warned.
                              If I had to describe Magi, it would be more than just about magic. Sure, there are wands, hats, and spells along with magical kingdoms of witchcraft and wizardry. What sets Magi a bit different is its conventional way of presenting the series in a world building form. From the start, it’s easy to notice that Magi takes the tone of an adventurous tone following protagonists Alibaba, Aladdin, Morgania, and. Hakuryuu Ren. No exception is the fact that these characters all have gone through hardships and became who they are today.

                              Yeah you read my ratings right, its that brilliant.
                              I'll start by saying that I'm both surprised yet not that this anime isn't as popular as it could've been (by far). As my first review, this might be paced awkwardly so bear with me. That being said, I've watched dozens of animes and can easily say this one is review-worthy :3
                              The realm of ""Shonen"" Anime & Manga is encompassed by two major things: Conformity and Mediocrity. The term itself; ""Shonen"",  immediately conjures a vast plethora of negatively inclined connotations, many of which are based off of only a small array of relatively insipid and generic titles, thus leading to an offhanded generalization that ""It's shonen, it must be bad."",  leaving many other unknown titles failing to receive the attention they may or may not deserve.  This seems to have muddled a lot of the thoughts of the average anime viewer, and so when one is suggested a title, say, ""Magi: The Kingdom          
                              ~ No spoilers, but I will assume that you have already seen Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic~
                              This review is for the second season of Magi, so expect light spoilers for season one.

                              Magi: The Kingdom of Magic is the second season of Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic. For those of you who have not watched the first season, I highly recommend it unless you have zero interest in the fantasy-action-adventure genre. For those of you who have watched the first season, the good news is that Magi II does not disappoint. Everything that you enjoyed and liked about Magi, whether it be the diverse cast of characters, the battle orchestration, or the plot development, Magi II delivers. 
                              This series or aptly put the second season of Magi franchise is filled with themes of exploration and adventure. The story is a unique spin on Arabian Nights and creators have made it highly intriguing and fascinating by giving new shapes to our favorite characters. I liked it because I was excited by seeing the new Avatars of my beloved characters. It was exciting to see an all star squad of heroes.

                              If it’s only enjoyment that you are after, then Magi: The Kingdom of Magic may suit your taste and entertain you well but if you are looking for an anime that has depth, then this may not be the closest one. Whether which is which, don’t get your expectations too high!
                              If you haven't watched Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic, then read no further but if you have, continue as want.
                              A catastrophic collapse and blunder is what the kingdom of magic can be described as. It takes a weird direction in terms of storytelling, character building and world building and centers it around a conflict that is brought upon due to mere selfish desires. The first season subtly built its world through political conflict, internal strife between characters, and eccentric disney like environment/setting. The Kingdom of magic deviation from it's predecessor seemed like a wild decision because any viewer can tell from the first few episodes that Magi was taking a new approach in how it continues to build the world and characters.

In reality, they are just an everyday trio of ordinary guys trying to pass the time, but who said everyday life couldn't be interesting?

Boring, if you ask me. I used to think that a pure comedy show revolving around high school students life is so common and dull, my perception changed after I watched Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou, I will refer it as Nichibro from this point. The title may give you a doubt, I wouldn't be surprised if you're skeptical, what's so great about watching a comedy anime revolving around highschoolers' everyday life? I'd say Nichibro stands out because it succeed in delivering what it offers, that is comedy.

                              Warning: There will be a copious amount of taking my comedy anime seriously
                              Story (9/10) - 
                              We are all aware about how first impressions are a very important factor if you’re going to enjoy a show. 
                              Danshi Koukousei No Nichijou - Daily life of high school boys.
                              What word would you choose to describe your high school days? Is it stressful, exhausting, slave-driving, or even fun in some cases?
                              Pros: Great comedy, short length, skit and episodic format make it easy to pick up
                              The story actually does not deserve a 10, but each episode had its own individual story that was pretty creative and all-out hilarious. This was probably the funniest anime I've seen, especially the starting scene. The opening song is great and the characters are really likable. This is not a sentimental anime that will make you cry, but just a comedic anime made for laughs. If you just want a funny anime this is my favorite. 
                              Words cannot describe the ingenuity behind what seems to be very common and ordinary everyday practices that we sees them as 'jokes'. Every single skits have been re-watched more than my re-watch of Christopher Nolan's Batman films and the Star Trek series. The show has me grinning like a fool for hours to end, even after I've finished the show and wished for a season 2. 
                              This anime is obviously about High School Boys and their daily lives, or should I say, the highlights of their daily lives? 
                              I haven't seen many anime to begin with, and I sure as hell did not know what to expect from a highschool themed anime after series like FMA:Brotherhood, Neon Genesis Evangelion, Death Note and the likes.
                              Ah, slice-of-life. If you are not one to enjoy putting yourself into the character's shoes... well you should at least give it a try for this anime. Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou is quite different from other comedy anime because rather than having a continuous plot, it has various skits. I am not exaggerating when I say this is my all-time favorite comedy anime (I have not watched Gintama yet so maybe my opinion will change).
                              First off, I died watching this show. If you're looking for a comedic anime this one is pure gold. The situations or little skits it shows, will most likely crack you up because its just stupid. Though the show doesn't really have much of a plot it mostly just exist for comedic purposes. 
                              M'kay, this kinda bored the crap outta me, now I know that there are those of you out there who totally love this type of genre but I wasnt feeling this at all. ",228

There's several minutes of comedic buildup involving the usual trio to the eventual announcement, and then the remaining runtime is teaser trailers for future episodes. It wasn't awful; the comedy is what you'd expect from Gintama(references to running gags and some 4th wall breaks), but the actual amount of non-ad content was too minimal for me to get much entertainment out of it. Might have been better if I'd watched this back when it was released, but as of now, I'd recommend skipping this and starting to the second season.          ",230

Normally it takes more than a month for me to watch series this long. Usually I get bored before the ending and start new random series so in the end it can easily take like a year for me to complete all of it. How long did it take from me to go trough all of Major then? 6 fucking days.
                              Before you read this review, I would like to say that before watching Major I have never watched or played in a baseball game before. (My country has no baseball love &gt;_&gt;) Despite that, I knew some of the basics from a few video games I've tried a little of before. I cannot vouch for those who are already familiar with baseball as I will be reviewing from the point of view of a newbie.
                              I started watching Major with the expectation that it would be your stereotypical sports anime.  And if you boil it down to its bones, it sort of is.  But it's the meat of the story, the actual conflicts and the actual relationships and the actual characters makes this a really entertaining series to watch.
                              I was MAJORly excited to watch Major. I was afraid of it being a MAJOR disappointment, but it ended up being MAJORly fun! 
                              Major is a definite must-see for anyone that enjoys sports anime/manga.  The plot is pretty much your typical addictive shonen sports anime, but there is some noteworthy drama elements in there as well. I personally enjoyed the series very much, some parts were definitely tear-jerkers, the rest was adrenaline packed baseball. 
                              Holy cow. Watching this Anime was one of the biggest mistakes I have ever made. Ever.
                              I don't know what was wrong with me but it took me time to watch Major though to be a sport genre anime sport which is my favourite anime genre, and no, it's not the baseball game, I already learned from Cross Gamer that baseball have great deep playing than tennis soccer or basketball and specifically because of that it is very enjoying sport, it was not also the length of the franchise - the more the anime is long I more love to marathon it, and still I don't know what kept mo so long to watch Major.
                              I signed up on AnimeList especially to give this review, I just got through the 3rd season of Major after watching S1-S2-S3 almost non-stop.
                              Okay, disclaimer, baseball is one of my favorite sports. I never got to play it growing up because I had track and that was in the spring, but it's one of my favorites. I religiously follow my favorite baseball team in the summer. But that's not the point of this anime.
                              I can't believe I haven't stumbled upon this anime until 2018 ... I confess I've seen all of it in less than a month and OMG it was sooo good.

                              Baseball. It has alot of mixed reviews when it comes to sports, but its just sports and its always amazing when you see someone give it all they have for the love of it.

                              This is how i review about Anime i watched and i will try my best to make my review short 
                              definitely worth a look, binged the series in a whole day and it brought me to tears at least 3-4 time. The first thing that caught my eye was the plot/storyline, just something intriguing and giving you the feeling of 'oh my, what's next' Secondly the characters! Probably one of the best protagonists you can have, Hasn't frustrated me once and have made me cry a few times. Hopefully, this review can give you a little insight of the anime, this is lowkey my first ever review online so I was lost for words at the number of times I saw 'not enough words'          ",231

                              This may be quite unfair but I really want to rate this show based on all 3 seasons and I am going to do just that. 
                              So, I just finished watching Nodame Cantabile Finale, the last season of Nodame Cantabile, and so my memory is still fresh about it, not that the anime is short forgotten, not by any given means, because this may well be one of the most memorable anime that I will ever be given the chance to watch.
                              *SPOILER FREE*
                              Paris-hen and finale could well have been made into one longer twenty something episode series as Finale directly follows from Paris-hen. If this was done Paris would have been better without affecting Finale.
                              Spoiler Alert!
                              I've watched this anime back when I was in elementary and now I've rewatched all 3 seasons having graduated from college. The experience watching this anime with different perspective of course is in itself different. Back then, all I knew was the comedy and romance genre of this anime. I was fascinated with the idea of music and Paris - that was the initial vibe I got from Nodame Cantabile. 
                              I'm not really fond of writing reviews, but I had to make a exception for Nodame Cantabile.
                              The first series to take the spot of ""personal favourite"" in my heart has been none other than the Nodame Cantabile series. This last part of the series proved to be an enjoyable watch like its prequels, however was lacking in the conclusiveness and depth of character development. I feel several plot articles were rushed and the end to not fully satisfy (hence needing me read the Opera-hen). 
                              Anime and Quality Films?
                              Nodame Cantabile: Finale only took me a day to watch through, and part of that is because it's an incredible addition to the NC series as a whole.
                              Finally, after putting it off for so long due to school, I was able to complete Nodame Cantabile. 
                              At last, we can see the closure to the one of much seen series of today’s anime.
                              Nodame Cantabile Finale is the third and final season of the series. This review assumes everyone reading has watched or is at least aware of seasons 1 and 2.",233

                              A sensory description accompanied by fields of gold swaying as the west wind moves. A reference to a European legend so obscure most people living where the legend was current will have never heard of it, and well-used to boot. A depiction of change, of progress and of its accompanying alteration of people's perception. All in a preamble spoken in a soft voice.
                              Spice and Wolf is a Supernatural, Romance, Adventure anime set in a sort of fantasy, European, Medieval world. The story itself revolves around a young travelling merchant (Craft Lawrence), who encounters a legendary wolf god, in the appearance of a cute girl (Holo/Horo) and they end up travelling together. However for those expecting plenty of wolf action or full-on romance may be disappointed. Instead it basically follows their journey from town to town, helping each other on complex business deals, whilst coming across major developments and dilemmas. Of course there are pockets of action &amp; minor romantic developments but those don&rsquo;t play much part until          
                              I saw this anime because of a few recommendations online and several glowing reviews, however upon watching Spice and Wolf I have to wonder how old the writers of these reviews are that they can find this enjoyable. If you've read any other review on this show, you'll know it is praised for its ""character depth"" and its use of economics. Let me warn you ahead of time, I have seen puddles with more depth than these characters. They are extremely 2 dimensional, the dialogue might as well have been written by a junior high student, and the monotonous tone of the voice acting is          
                              ""Presented a whole new definition for anime. One of a kind story-plot. Intriguing character relationships.""
                              ""We won't laugh until we get the money, we won't cry until we go bankrupt.""
                              Overview:
                              Wolves are beautiful creatures to look at. You see them prowling around the woods with their pack and rule the territory that they claim as their own. There is no doubt that they have been the focal point in some anime shows over the years, but when have you seem them being used as an intelligent focal point in a show's narrative? Out comes Spice and Wolf, a tale that follows two of our heroes in their journey involving mercantilism, to convince us once and for all that you can pull off a simple concept and make something brilliant out of it.
                              It's an anime about economics. And cheating out of economics with a giant wolf.
                              In one word, spectacular.
                              Personally I did not especially enjoy &ldquo;Spice And Wolf&rdquo; for what it was originally advertised, its dealings and plots involving medieval economics. Those sounded promising but proved to be a bit too difficult for me to fully grasp and really enjoy. Sure, the various aspects of economy, trading and business were interesting and quite unique to see portrayed in an anime series like that, but in the end they did not seem to be able to bring it in such a way that it provided grasping plot material. The fact on most occasions they resorted to standard action events (double-crossings, betrayal, attack by wild wolves,...)          
                              At first I was baffled what kind of anime is S&amp;W and would it leave an impression on me when I watched it. Happily enough, it did and with a fresh genre that it introduced for today's generation.
                              Usually, when one thinks of fantasy, sword-wielding heroes and epic battles are the first things that come to mind. Indeed, these are the norm for the genre. While there are some great stories that fit into this description, such as Lord of the Rings, or Berserk (to name an anime), the genre can feel quite stale. In this sea of monotonous tales, Spice and Wolf provides a refreshingly different take on the genre. It is a charming, laid-back tale that treads in territory scarcely explored in fantasy: Economics.
                              The driving force behind any action we take can be attributed to the profit as a result of said action. Whether that profit is tangible or intangible, our lives are loosely based on a ""avoid punishments and collect rewards"" mentality. Yet, it is strange. We sacrifice our health in order to acquire wealth only to spend that surplus to recuperate our well being. In that sense, it is seemingly irrational for us to work without pause in with the hope that our efforts will be handsomely rewarded.
                              Spice and Wolf is a peaceful journey through a stylized, medieval Europe.  The story follows Lawerence Craft, a successful merchant, as he travels a winding path North to take his companion, the wolf-god, Holo, back to the home she has nearly forgotten.",234
