3,"The self-proclaimed mad scientist Rintarou Okabe rents out a room in a rickety old building in Akihabara, where he indulges himself in his hobby of inventing prospective ""future gadgets"" with fellow lab members: Mayuri Shiina, his air-headed childhood friend, and Hashida Itaru, a perverted hacker nicknamed ""Daru."" The three pass the time by tinkering with their most promising contraption yet, a machine dubbed the ""Phone Microwave,"" which performs the strange function of morphing bananas into piles of green gel.

Though miraculous in itself, the phenomenon doesn't provide anything concrete in Okabe's search for a scientific breakthrough; that is, until the lab members are spurred into action by a string of mysterious happenings before stumbling upon an unexpected success—the Phone Microwave can send emails to the past, altering the flow of history.

Adapted from the critically acclaimed visual novel by 5pb. and Nitroplus, Steins;Gate takes Okabe through the depths of scientific theory and practicality. Forced across the diverging threads of past and present, Okabe must shoulder the burdens that come with holding the key to the realm of time.

                              The subject of time travel is no stranger to the world of anime, so it takes a lot of work to make a time travel story stand out. For Steins;Gate, that hard work paid off. This is by far the best-executed time travel story that I've ever seen in my experience with anime, and if you haven't seen it yet, you're definitely missing out!
                              As you may have noticed, Steins;Gate is revered as a masterpiece by most.  For those of you who haven't had the privilege of watching this show yet, i'm writing this (belated) review to emphasize just how much you're missing out on. 
                              Just a horrible anime. This is the anime equivalent of Inception. It tries to disguise itself as being complex and cool when it's really simple and stupid.  How it managed to fool so many people into believing it is the former is beyond me.
                              One word: Hype.
                              Note that I have not read the visual novel that Steins;Gate is based on. This is a review which judges the anime adaptation by its own merits alone.
                              Steins;Gate changed my life.
                              Tutturu~! It took me awhile to finish this review, school, other online drama and whatnot. So here is my in depth evaluation/praise of the show Steins;Gate. I must say that I have excluded a lot of spoiling content so that I can have a legitimate review posted. This is my first review and I hope it informs you and gives you a different perspective of the show!
                              I Have no Idea why I am writing this review
                              Steins Gate is one of the most famous Anime of all time, especially on this website, and during the last twenty years or so that have passed, many works that do not deserve any fame or recognition have unfortunately garnered a lot of fans, and we saw a lot of these works get sanctified and venerated by others, whereas in actuality, these Anime do not deserve five minutes of your time. So, is the original Steins Gate Anime one of those Anime, or is it something that is worth your time and investment? 
                              Steins;Gate. One of the most popular visual novels of 2009. When I first heard it would get an anime adaptation, I was both psyched and worried. We all know VN to anime adaptations don’t work out that well most (read: almost ALL) of the time, and we all know that ChäoS;HEAd’s anime was absolutely terrible, especially if you compare it to the obviously superior source material, but even because of all this I was incredibly hyped for it. I had only heard great things about the VN, and I was getting my hopes up really high. 
                              Let me start with some back story and then the actual review will follow.
                              This is what should be considered as art, not what is considered as art nowadays. Sadly, nowadays among the majority of people, Anime is just considered as nonsensical and childish trash. It is drawn, so it is immature. This is what the majority thinks, and this is why it is normally difficult to find any Otaku living in near of you. It's a shame actually, that they will not experience this awesomeness, and obviously I am looking at Steins;Gate when I am saying that. Ironically, I've recently been pretty much the same, like, two or three months ago.  But I tried Anime and was          
                              An anime as dull and flat as its colour palette.  
                              I put up with this anime for so many episodes because I was told it would get better. That never happened. Really boring show. I found all the characters to be pretty mediocre and the plot moved at a snails pace. By the time the twist or the climax happened there was no enjoyment to receive for how boring the show was before. Reading other reviews I really don't see what they get in this anime, and I'm not one who typically deviates from general consensus on most anime. At least the opening for this show was really good though!          ",3

                              At first, when I read the synopsis of hunter x hunter (2011) (for the rest of this review will be called hxh as abbreviation) I could not quite deduce the rationality of this show being scored and reviewed with such praise as it receives on a daily basis. I am sure many of you ,who are planning to pick up this show sometime soon, are thinking the same as I did before watching this show and I will do my best to change any contravening opinions towards this series.
                              ""I see now... Yes... I see... You had me in checkmate from the start."" - Meruem 
                              HxH is one of the many overrated shounen anime out there and I can summarize my review with one sentence: „If you became kinda interested in HxH, because you have heard it’s so much more than just a shounen, don’t believe it, because it is exactly that, just another shounen."" Now I’m not a fan of shounen, and if you read this review you will find out why, so this anime is not made for me, but just for more diversity in views I will analyze this anime a bit closer.
                              After years of everyone from personal friends to random internet commentators imploring me to watch Madhouse’s 2011 adaptation of Hunter x Hunter, I finally got around to it. I was told that this was the best long-form battle shounen out there, avoiding all the sins of mediocrity other Shonen Jump titles like Naruto, One Piece, and Bleach commit. I was told Hunter x Hunter did not constantly try to implausibly escalate the stakes of each battle, didn’t rely on boring cliché motivations of characters just wanting to get stronger for no reason, did not draw out its battle sequences for outrageous lengths of time, did          
                              Heed my warning and heed it well: If you so choose to watch the gracious series that is Hunter x Hunter (2011), watch it well past the first few episodes. Though the first few episodes make the entire series as a whole seem bland, if you think this way, you're wrong and you should feel bad. Really really bad. Think of it this way: the series is a marathon runner. A good runner prepares himself and warms up for the long arduous journey ahead (ie. HxH). The bad runner carelessly takes off from the start with no preparation and eventually dying down halfway through because          
                              I often see people complain about a lack of originality when talking about anime titles without giving it proper thought. The very idea of ""being original"" is within itself a fallacy, especially when referring to any form of storytelling. Everything in one way or another draws inspiration from something else and seeking out ""original"" content shouldn't be an end goal for viewers. What one should look for is how the content itself is presented. A typical story setup is only hindered by the writer and execution of said story. Proper execution and presentation can often be what makes or breaks a show. And even a

                              - Sorry for bad english -
                              So I've recently finished watching HxH after tons of recommendations from friends.
                              Story: 9.6/10
                              **This review will contain spoilers**
                              Whenever Shonen Jump releases anime based on a popular manga they are usually for the fighting and story enthusiasts. Hunter X Hunter is a show that balances the two perfectly in the form of a Yin-Yang.  Although this story is fiction, it’s still based on some part of the truth of the real world we reside in. The story is brutal, deep, emotional, breathtaking and much more! A story that is different, but yet has the same basic elements you would expect from a Shonen anime. I won’t go into details of the story or the arc because I can’t mention that without spoiling          
                              HxH has to be one of the most overrated shonen anime out there if I've ever seen it , it has the most toxic , egotistical and elitist demographic out there. The fans of this show sit on the throne they fantasise about and constantly brag about how well-written or complex this show is just to feed their inferiority complex , there are many reasons as to why I rated this show the way I did and soon you'll find out why.
                              What makes a show great? Is it the engaging story? Is it the interesting characters? Is it the immersion the show creates? I find myself always asking these questions whenever I start a series. Hunter x Hunter was no exception. I hadn't heard much when I first started it, but I had heard comparisons to Fullmetal Alchemist and Attack on Titan, both of which are some of my favorite shounens. Still, I had my doubts. ""148 episodes? How could there possibly be that much interesting plot without fillers?"" I asked. I was a fool.",4

While Reinhard climbs the ranks of the Empire with the aid of his childhood friend, Siegfried Kircheis, he must fight not only the war, but also the remnants of the crumbling Goldenbaum Dynasty in order to free his sister from the Kaiser and unify humanity under one genuine ruler. Meanwhile, on the other side of the galaxy, Yang—a strong supporter of democratic ideals—has to stand firm in his beliefs, despite the struggles of the FPA, and show his pupil, Julian Mintz, that autocracy is not the solution.

As ideologies clash amidst the war's many casualties, the two strategic masterminds must ask themselves what the real reason behind their battle is.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",9.07,9,7,627,231540,13909,"                              This is Star Wars. Lucas's franchise should be renamed to something else.
                              Legend of the Galactic Heroes is an epic tale of the rise to power of two men born at the right time on opposite sides, leading to a clash of brilliant spectacle that could only be executed with care in as an animated original.
                              It is so rare to find any type of lengthy series that span over 100 episodes without declining in quality over its duration due to various factors such as the abundance of inconsistencies in the story, or rehashing the same narrative structural wise, which is pretty common in long running series. Other limiting factors are the available funds for its execution, or its own popularity, which can induce authors to change the course of the story. However, there is one title that managed to evade said issues, being an adaptation of a series of novels by Yoshiki Tanaka, with a lengthy production of 110 OVA          
                              History is not just the study of the past, but the events that occur throughout history hold a different meaning for different people. These past events encompass the overall thoughts, beliefs, ideas, and conceptions of all those who lived throughout it.  When a war between two different states and political ideologies breaks out with both states claiming to be fighting on the side of righteousness, which side is truly the right one?  This is the overarching theme of of the epic 110 episode OVA space opera, Legend of the Galactic Heroes. Adapted from the science fiction novel series by Yoshiki Tanaka and directed          
                              I can’t believe people has dubbed this most intellectual and complex to have come to anime. This is pretty much all talk and an unoriginal generic war story. Basically it follows two men and a guy who drinks tea on death star. These three are your typical “fight against the man because they are corrupted” characters. Of course everyone is corrupted because apparently humanity always ruins itself in the future. Humanity is split apart so our heroes must re-unite the universe, lame. If this was like 50 episodes I would probably rate this 7 and consider recommending to people.
                              Overview:
                              Legend of the Galactic Heroes feels like reading a book. 
                              Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu is a somewhat odd series, in anime terms. It began as a series of novels in the 80s, got adapted into a manga and, over the course of the late 80s to late 90s, it was turned into a 110 episode OVA. The odd part being that it was released as an OVA. For those of you who don't know, an OVA is a direct to video/ DVD release rather than one that runs on a televised network. Usually OVAs are pretty short, running somewhere from an episode to maybe a dozen. A hundred and ten episodes is virtually unheard of from          
                              Are you tired of Good Republic vs Evil Empire? Are you tired of archaic honor and pointless martyrdom? Are you tired of war dramas with runaway nationalism and selfless sacrifice to secure the government's next election victory?
                              A masterpiece! This is anime for adults. When watching it you are seeing a historical epic unfold before your eyes. It is not only one of the greatest anime series of all time, IMHO, but also one of the greatest science fiction series of all time. For both anime fans and science fiction fans it is a must see. 
                              This isn't Star Wars. George Lucas's franchise should NOT be renamed into anything else.
                              I'd like to preface this review with the fact that I'm an avid science fiction reader and have chewed through a fair amount of books in my day.  Within minutes of beginning this show you can see how derivative it is from a series of books.
                              What I have just witnessed was history unfolding before my very eyes!
                              Usually, when I have a high expectations for a show, after watching it I end up somehow disappointed. For this reason, before I watch a show I lower my expectations.
                              Legend of the Galactic Heroes is an old ass OVA series spanning 110 episodes which elitists or 'cultured' anime fans deem to be the greatest anime of all time.",5

As he stretches to fight the leftover sluggishness of a satisfying sleep, he decides to step out on the balcony. The warm wind of a mellow morning slowly brushes past his fragile frame as if greeting him friendly. The sunshine reflects from the river just beneath the railing; a lustrous shimmer signals the change of seasons. He leaves the apartment.

He has moved on.
                              There is no anime that I am more confident in calling a masterpiece than 3-gatsu no Lion. What it is able to do is so powerful and I find it unparalleled by any other show that I have watched. Every single aspect of the show is masterful and is able to shine and enhance the show even more.
                              One year after 3-gatsu no Lion’s first season, the second one has arrived. And it manged to be even more outstanding. 
                              Ah, 3-gatsu no Lion. How I wanted to love you, and how disappointed I ultimately was. Most of the time I agree with the crowd when it comes to such things such as media review. If it’s well-received by critics, I tend to like it as well. If most people find shortcomings, most of the time I resonate with those as well. But considering I’m giving this anime a rating substantially lower than the stellar (above 9 at the time of writing) average on MAL, take this review with a grain of salt. 
                              All fart no shit.
                              I saw season one some time ago, assumed there was no second season and gave the first one 9/10. It was great.
                               The second season is so boring, it shows a lot of not usefull stuff from kawamoto family, and it gets really anoying as the anime goes. When I saw the first season, I got super interested on Kyouko, Nikaidou, Shimada and Souya, but they barely appear on the this season, instead, there are a lot of scenes of Akari cooking, I mean, not intersting at all. 
                              3-gatsu no Lion is a spectacularly popular and accredited anime that unfortunately falls short of all the hype that the series has generated. It is incredibly overrated, however it is still decent relative to the thousands of anime series out there. I know I'm going to receive a lot of flack for this review so without further ado I shall outline my arguments.
                              For people new to 3-gatsu no lion, the main problem with this series is, It doesn't have any negative reviews and it feels as if fans are only watching it. So here I am writing a genuine review for you so that you might have a better understanding of the series you are about to watch.
                              A short review for those that are new to this anime.

                              Sangatsu no Lion is an anime that challagens even the most boring lives in the world. An anime the vanquishes all sense of extraordinary and unique to portray the most average kind of drama someone could ever experience during adolescence.

                              **THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS**
                              ***This is a spoiler free review***
                              As I've seen every part of this series in this year, I can say this story gives the tip of the iceberg. It concludes the main arc it had, not only flawlessy, but add something on top of it. I rarely purchase the source material for an anime, but clearly, I will purchase the entire series. I am suggesting anyone, who is just astound how this 2nd season has an high ranking, just to watch the entire series in release order.
                              Like everyone who has watched Monogatari to this point, I'm obviously a huge fan of the show, which is why it pains me to say this, but: Owarimonogatari 2nd Season is overrated.  Honestly, several parts of the Monogatarai series are better than this, including the first season.  And while it was an enjoyable entry, I kind of expected more, considering this is the highest ranked of all the Monogatari series.  But, in truth, this turned into one massive cop out after another.  
                              After a few months of watching Monogatari, I finally came to the second season of Owarimonogatari. And what an experience it was. There was everything I loved about this series, complex story, great music and characters and extensive but interesting dialogues. The only problem for some people can be the pace at which first episodes go, so it might be a problem for some people, at least at the beginning I think.
                              Originally I was only planning to watch Bakemonogatari because it was recommended to me saying it is like Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai. I did not expect after a few months I would watch the whole series and finally reach this point that I am just in awe of the trip I have taken. 
                              Owarimonogatari 2nd Season is one of those animes that have everything you will like.
                              (Before reading the review, or planning on watching this anime. Please do realize that this arc marked the end of the journey of Araragi's confrontations of the supernatural, amidst his occupation as a high schooler, before being graduated from being a high schooler to a college student. That being said, it's unwise and rather illogical to not watch this at the very end of the timeline, which can be discerned here (http://imgur.com/UjlhSyS). But that being said, you must watch all aired series of monogatari, excluding hanamonogatari ofc, since it's entirely irrelevant to the main story or the main attention of the plot of Koyomi, the          
                              Owarimonogatari’s Second Season is essentially the climax of the series, or at least one of them. We finally get to see others take care of Araragi in the same manner he takes care of others. Owarimonogatari II features and resolves Araragi’s Ghost Stories in a similar fashion it has featured and resolved every other character’s. 
                              Look, if youv'e gotten this far in the series, you're not gonna be reading reviews to check if you should finish. This review is for people who are wondering if this is a series that will be worth investing in, or for those who just finished the first one or two series and are thinking ""...is this worth it?""

                              Owarimonogatar Season 2 clearly solved all the problems and questions we always had throughout the series. We could say this is the end(but not technically). I really enjoyed watching this and was totally immersed during the whole 3 episodes. Not to mention in light novel as well.",15

",8.91,8,18,36,1279013,64955,"                              Code Geass is the dumbest show to ever take itself seriously. It is essentially a hackneyed amalgamation of clichés and overused plot devices that clumsily attempts to disguise itself as something greater. Hell, it stole Death Note’s whole shtick, and ruined it completely, before the anime version even finished airing. It blatantly stole from Evangelion, the most popular mecha anime and deconstruction there is, to make one of the weakest and most cliché mecha series ever. Both of the series Code Geass stole from were dark and had at least some depth; Code Geass, on the other hand, juxtaposes pseudo-dark scenes with light school-life harem          
                              Put on your seatbelts and brace yourself, for you will be taken on a rabidly-paced and concluding journey, slaloming through plot twists and character development at a tempo that will leave you longing for a new episode at the end of each one. Save a lot of time, for this is obnoxiously addictive. This is... Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch... R2!
                              *A great sequel to Code Geass, but not quite a masterpiece.*
                              On the surface, this looked great - promising setting, themes, characters, world. Unfortunately, all things that were clever about Season 1 were scrapped in favor of... well, I don't know, really. Shocking the audience? Misplaced fanservice?
                              Code Geass R2 is, in essence, the most resounding travesty in the history of Japanese animation, and proof that anime fans will watch anything if it panders to them enough. It is to anime what Heroes is to US television, except that when Heroes became terrible midway through the viewers abandoned the series. This monstrosity only got more popular in the same situation. It's truly baffling.
                              Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion Review:
                              I'm going to write a review about R2 that may not be well liked among Geass fans, for the low score I give it, but I ask the reader to hear me out and read this in an impartial light. 
                              Code Geass R2 has provoked conflicting reactions among the fan base, just like the original series did. Viewers still loved or hated it outright, even as many others laughed, and once again it's not hard to see why.
                              The sequel outdoes the original!
                              I've been trying to review this series since it ended, but it's proven difficult because while I want to treat it as impartially as possible, there are a lot of factors that went into the decision-making of the series that make it hard to judge in just one way. I'm sure that that's true for a lot of series, but it's simply that I've been made all too aware about everything that had to do with this one. Being a huge fan of the first season doesn't help either.
                              Well, I'm not going to be very positive about Code Geass R2. Since the first season was actually pretty good, I started to watch CG R2 in the hope that R2 would be just as great. 
                              NaNoWriMo is an annual event in which the goal is to write a novel in 30 days. Anyone can do it, but in order to reach your goal, you often sacrifice editing, plotting a narrative, and forgetting certain character developments you meant to make. The reason I say this is because Code Geass R2 is an exact reflection of the NaNoWriMo story down to the last detail.
                              After a hugely successful season 1, we have the highly anticipated sequel, Code Geass R2.
                              Generally I review only the anime that haven't been reviewed but Code Geass R2 affected me so much I had to write a review. RL Context: Work and other RL obligations had kept me from anime for a while. Coming back to anime and starting with .Hack/Sign wasn't the smartest thing to do. Thank god the next anime I saw was this one, or I would probably have gone on another anime hiatus.

                              Given that this season feels like it was split in half by the story, I'm gonna go at this that way because, otherwise, I won't have anything to say.
                              This review covers the Gintama series as a whole. 
                              This season had a lot going for it. It immediately fixed the pacing issues of the season before it, it put its budget on display immediately, and even though the story shift halfway through sounds strange in concept, it really worked, and looked like it was going places. The emotionally charged opening had one of the best songs in the entire series, and effectively used the massive cast to its advantage.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.82,8,24,38,1265163,25979,"                              This is like watching a dream. Sometimes when you have those moments where you picture something then you say to yourself that was not reality, the image that came to my mind must be from a different world that I saw somewhere, but not that I can recall when or where. This is like opening a door deep down in your mind and behind that door lies all your lucid dreams and imaginations. watch it for sure, you can never go wrong with this.
                              This is my first review in MyAnimeList, so I apologize in advance if you find the ideas I'll put forward here badly-written, explained or structured.
                              In many ways this is a difficult review to write.  This is because I&rsquo;m clearly not the target audience, as Spirited Away is a film that is clearly targeted towards children.  In the end, I simply decided to review the film as I normally do and leave a disclaimer about not being the target audience.
                              The very facet of childhood can be boiled down to the very definition of mysterious wonder and awe-inspiring imagination. We’ve all had those moments where we would go off into our own little world of childlike imagination and try experience an entirely new reality different from our own. Films have tried to recapture the atmosphere that resembles this nostalgic feeling of experiencing the journey of childhood that either succeeded or failed. It just takes a man like Miyazaki to do just that flawlessly.
                              At the time of this writing, Spirited Away is ranked #2 among anime movies on this site.  In my opinion, that is sorely inaccurate.  Reading the reviews for it, there are a lot of remarks about the excellent animation and soundtrack (rightfully so) and the strong character design (understandably so), but beyond that, the praise begins to falter.  People struggle to justify the disjointed nature of the film, sometimes going with ""shows remarkable creativity"" and sometimes just falling back on ""makes me nostalgic.""  Viewers who liked it don't know why they liked it, and that doesn't surprise me.
                              As an Oscar-nominated animated feature by a world renowned director and studio, everyone had high expectations for this movie.
                              By far my favorite Miyazaki film, Spirited Away transported me to a place that I never wanted to leave. The visuals of this film are simply astounding. The colorful landscapes and the ornate buildings really brought the films story to life. The music was also extremely excellent. The characters were the best part of the film. Each one had their own story to tell. Most people might write this film off as a childrens movie, but in my opinion this is a movie that everyone- adults included- can watch and enjoy.           
                              Giving this a 10/10 is the equivalent of giving Dora The Explorer a 10/10.
                              As I'm aging everyday, I felt the need to reminisce about my childhood past, and so recently I decided to re-watch a whole bunch of Disney movies as well as Miyazaki (Studio Ghibili) films. (By the way, did you guys hear that Studio Ghibili is no more? Depressing news for future generations). The movies brought me to tears, and I couldn't help but feel an urge to write a review on how significantly emotional and magnificent Miyazaki's films are. Spirited Away is definitely by far the most popular of all Miyazaki's films considering he won a countless number of awards for the movie and it          
                              Unfortunately, the movie that introduced 'mainstream' America to Miyazaki is not as good as it has been advertised.
                              Spirited Away was one of my first anime. I remember my mom came home from the movie store with it one day. It was a pleasant surprise for me to find that such a film exists. After it ended I said to myself, this isn't like any other animated films I had ever seen before . . . and then I watched it a second time.
                              I'm sorry, with respect to what he's accomplished, Miyazaki can't tell a good story to save his life. As a test, ask someone who loves Spirited Away for a brief wiki-style synopsis and see if they can do it. Probably not, but it's not their fault; it's a plot based on coincidences and contrivances. The sentimentalism is manipulative & manufactured (aww, the old spider guy has developed a grandfatherly attachment to the protagonist for no reason! etc) and the usually great Joe Hisaishi is reduced to sappy Disney style orchestral ""emotional scene #50"" muzak. At a bloated two hours, I don't think good visuals are

                              No matter how you approach a review for this movie, this will always be one of the greatest animes ever made. It has fluid artwork and strong characters. And it  eschews from typical anime stereotypes. Most importantly, it has a strong moral point about growing up.",22

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.78,8,27,41,1259258,62487,"                              Cowboy Bebop is one of those series that is just impossible to criticize. Not because it has no flaws, but because it has rabid fans who will defend it to the death. It has obtained the mythical “classic armor,” which is an abhorrent carte blanche, bestowed upon only the most overrated of anime, that is used to automatically defend against any sort of legitimate criticism. Cowboy Bebop certainly has good qualities, and it is relevant in how it influenced western perception of anime, but it wasn't quite groundbreaking or revolutionary in and of itself. You could argue that its audiovisuals were in fact groundbreaking, but          
                              Cowboy Bebop was originally an anime series created by Shinichiro Watanabe in 1998. It consists of 26 episodes, a mini-sode, and a theatrical movie. It was released in America in 2001, and is one of the few anime franchises to be more successful in North America than in its native Japan. I have seen the 26 tv episodes and the movie. I already know what a lot of you are doing right now after glancing at the numerical score I gave; you're hitting up the comment box on my profile and writing these exact words:
                              Only a few anime series or movies could be considered true classics, and one of the most notable shows to fall into this category is iconic not just for its style, design and animation, but also for the depth of its characters and its music.
                              Cowboy Bebop was one of the first anime that truly impressed me. 
                              Cowboy Bebop is an episodic series. By episodic, I mean that one episode doesn't necessarily lead or follow the next one. With that being said, don't expect a lot of ""plot"" in this series. You watch Cowboy Bebop for the characters, plain and simple. Spike, Faye, Jet, Ed, Ein are what make this anime arguably one of the most memorable series ever produced. The music is awesome (especially if you're a fan of Jazz), the animation is top notch (considering when the series came out), and the enjoyment value is second to none.
                              Cowboy Bebop has something that the anime world has seem to have forgotten in a coinpurse somewhere: balls.
                              Cowboy Bebop is, in effect, an episodic, slice of life sort of series revolving around our Space Cowboys (and girls) Spike, Jet, Faye and Ed. This review is here to tackle some points about the series I feel are worth mentioning, as I know it's all been said before.
                              I think its quite saddening that I don't have anything better to do than writing a review. On christmas! However, this really needs to be done at some point, and while other people are eating cookies, I'll do this one: Cowboy Bebop Review Mk II. New and improved, rated by my new guidelines!
                              There’s nothing quite like it when you come off an anime and realize how much it has built itself as this vital piece of art that has since transcended its ever-present influence on other mediums. This particular show, named Cowboy Bebop, definitely lived up the legacy it deserves of being the pinnacle of late ’90s anime that would influence a wide variety of anime leading up to the new millennium. Even with all that has been all said and done, that’s not to say that Cowboy Bebop has its fair share of hiccups.
                              ""Cowboy Bebop"" reeks. It really does. It reeks of originality, it reeks of attitude, but most of all, it reeks of perfection.
                              Story, Character, and Enjoyment: 10/10 Drama Llama? 
                              I was scared to touch this anime. Despite the reviews, despite my friend's sage advice, despite everything, I resisted for months. I didn't want to dive into something that showed only on Adult Swim at 2 in the morning on weekdays. It didn't seem like the kind of show I wanted to watch. I want to see the latest and greatest, the anime that grab the headlines, that are here and now, that are modern and are visually appealing. Cowboy Bebop didn't seem to me like it fit into any category I ever liked either. Western styled mixed with space drama? How can that even          
                              First of all, let it be known that Cowboy Bebop is an episodic anime. This changes the whole scope of the piece, as it's goal is completely different from those of more traditional ways of storytelling. And so, it shall be interpreted and criticized as such. 
                              ""Cowboy Bebop is a generally overrated Anime that now is mostly famous due to its continues element of referencing Western pop culture, high-quality OST, and well-animated action sequences, however, doesn’t offer neither too much in actual substance nor actual characterization worth mentioning in its episodic narrative"".
                              I have been putting Cowboy Bebop off for a month or two, watching an episode here, watching an episode there, dropping it, putting it on hold, picking it back up again, etc. It's a little hard to get into considering it is solely character driven from the first episode on, and since you don't even find out...anything...about the characters until the tenth or so episode, there isn't much to work off of in the ""do I or don't I"" character like/attachment department.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.72,8,39,15,1601244,91279,"                              Code Geass is one of my favorite anime. Why? It's filled with so much action, bombastic dialogue, and has such eye-catching visuals that it tops the charts in entertainment value. This is an exciting and epic anime and it's over the top. 
                              Alright, its taken me since April to reach this point so I may as well dispense with any further delays and say it outright.  Code Geass:  Lelouch of the Rebellion is not a masterpiece, it isn’t a great show nor is it a very good one.  What it is is a marginally good television program that takes concepts and characters from a wide variety of successful anime productions from the last decade and stitches them all together into twenty-five episodes of vulgarity and excess, a Frankenstein’s monster of a production that has the cold manufactured feel of a product of a focus          
                              Directed by Goro Taniguchi, arguably one of the best directorial talents left at studio Sunrise, and written by his Planetes screenwriter Ichiro Okouchi, Code Geass promised to be a true epic series in the making. An interesting alternate history, a lead character that promised to evolve into a ruthless rebel seeking revenge against the father and the country that ruined his and his sisters life and a dash of mecha added into the mix for good measure. So why did it turn into such a complete circus? An absolute mess of jumbled ideas never touched upon in any way that isn`t absurd or laughable, a          
                              Code Geass is set in a alternate reality where the Britannian Empire has conquered more than one third of the world and counting, and that includes Japan. In said Japan, now called &quot;Area 11&quot; - and its inhabitants &quot;elevens&quot; -, a Britannian student named Lelouch Lamperouge finds himself thrown into a cycle of events that ultimately leads to him gaining a power known as the &quot;Geass&quot;, a power allowing him to force anyone to obey any order he gives to them. Together with his hate for Britannia, he uses his newfound powers to gain followers and eventually bring forth a war against the oppressive Britannian          
                              Yet another review for the highly acclaimed Code Geass. I believe this is the 98th review C.G would’ve received; but I can’t help but review this even if so many others have. 
                              Code Geass is awesome. If you have any qualms against it, whether you dislike mecha or anything like that, put it aside and watch a few episodes. Then you'll see what I mean when I say that Code Geass is a great anime.  
                              Probably one of the most blatantly obvious train-wrecks of bad writing in the history of serial visual narrative production, shamefully destroying its own at first stimulating concept of alternate reality with awful characterizations, extremely weak script and cheap developments that only serve the purpose of working as a &ldquo;shock-factor&rdquo; to keep the audience entranced beyond the notice of a very clear lack of sequential planning.
                              Some people like to attribute Code Geass's success to the fact that it is a Sunrise mecha.  Personally, I'd like to think that it succeeds (critically) despite the fact that it is a Sunrise mecha.  Code Geass manages to establish a believable backdrop from which it launches a compelling plot along with motivated and realistic characters, something that has been missing from the last few Gundam series produced by Sunrise.  It injects a plot where the focus is finally on the characters and the events surrounding them, rather than the machines that they use to fight.  In fact, it could be          
                              Code Geass is one of those series that can inspire praise, hatred or mere ridicule, depending on what is expected or what can be tolerated. Curiously, I find entirely valid reasons behind each of those reactions. There's still a bit of this and that, to put it bluntly, but perhaps the lines aren't quite as clear as they seem.
                              There some mecha's that achieve near brilliance, and others that are rendered useless in their awkward failure. Code Geass is neither of this. 
                              At first when i heard of how great Geass was and then I learned it was a mecha show, I was a bit reluctant to watch it since I am not a big fan of mecha. But once I sat down and watched code geass I was really impressed at how good it was.
                              The other reviews available here cover a lot of details, so this will be a somewhat brief overview that will concentrate only on the main aspects, without spoilers.
                                Code Geass is the most overrated anime on the top 20 list.  
                              Code Geass is definitely a very popular anime, no denying that, but I wouldn't exactly call it a master piece, but it is however, a fun and entertaining show, you just don't need to put too much thought into it.

Although they harbor no ill intentions towards humans, many suffer from the side effects of their existence and strange nature; exploiting the Mushi without understanding them, even unintentionally, can lead to disaster and strife for any involved. Mushishi Zoku Shou continues the story of Mushishi Ginko on his journey to help the visible world to coexist with the Mushi.

During his travels, Ginko discovers various gifted individuals—those cursed by circumstance and those maintaining a fragile symbiosis with the Mushi—inevitably confronting the question of whether humanity, talented and tortured alike, can manage the responsibility of the unseen. Moreover, as a Mushishi, Ginko must learn more about these strange beings and decide if he has the right to interfere with the complex relationships between Mushi and mankind.

Mushishi held this title and I'm proud to say that Mushishi Zoku Shou holds it as well. When such an eloquent blend  of story writing, narration, atmosphere, art and sound come together it creates a fantastic, bone-chilling new world that those whom have the pleasure of viewing can't help but gawk at. Whether there is sadness, happiness, anguish or joy Mushishi Zoku Shou has delivered these feelings in a presentation so well-wrapped even its flaws cannot be seen.

                              There is a common saying that lightning never strikes twice at the same place. The same analogy can be applied to how a sequel of a classic never reaches the quality of that of its predecessor. However, both statements are far from the truth; it’s just that we don’t often see both happen very often. But when we do see it, its nothing short of magical.
                              ""once the rain stops and real tears can be shed, I will put down roots. Until then, with the rain by my side, I will continue to drift like the clouds""
                              Back in my days absorbed into slice of life anime, a word like ""fascination"" with Mushishi understated my feelings at the time. Try ""enamoured."" ""Obsessed."" It has a likeable, highly capable protagonist with such an introspective personality. It integrated the elements of mystery, fantasy, and the supernatural in far better ways than its dystopian (Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou) or complex (Ghost in the Shell) seinen contemporaries. It should also be noted that Aniplex’s responsibility for a great deal of superior anime promised a series like this success.
                              Mushishi Zoku Shou continues the story of Ginko, a mushishi, which roughly equates to one part medicine man, one part paranormal expert. Mushi exist in a sort of gray area between living creatures and spiritual, other worldly beings. 
                              ""Now make yourself comfortable and cosy, after 8 long years your beloved mushi master Ginko will take you to the mysterious world of mushi once again."" Or that I thought before watching the series. From the very beginning I had some vague feeling that something here isn't how it should be. I mean I know it isn't an action whatsoever, but don't you think 10 seconds of completely white screen in the opening is an oversimplification? Well, who needs the opening, one may say. That's true I was going to skip it anyway. But after watching several episodes you will notice that good art and          
                               I don't think my opinion on Mushishi is going to change at all, after many years, I was beyond thrilled to have the chance to dive back into this show. Quite simply this show is just beautifully animated, written and acted. 
                              Good Day all , this review is gonna be short and I hope you gonna decide that you watch it or not from my review . 
                               I've got to admit, by the end of episode 9, I was ready for the series to end. This may be because I had been watching this anime in long sequences and being an anime with single episode arcs, it's not really an anime that is good for watching in long sequences. When I watched Mushishi, I would watch a single episode and then play video games and read. I suspect that made me enjoy it more then I would have if I watched the episodes back it back. It may also be that the stories in Mushishi were more interesting, perhaps because they          
                              Mix a few of these episodes in the original Mushishi, and hardly anyone would notice the difference. That’s not a compliment. The original Mushishi had mainly novelty value. It was a deeply flawed show with a brilliant premise. Next Passage doesn’t do much but gets more steam out of it.
                              (This review is completely my opinion, but any constructive criticism to better myself as a writer and critic is greatly appreciated) 
                              Having written a short review on Mushishi with vague statements (it's in the first season of Mushishi), I feel like writing a full fledged analytical (self proclaimed :v ) review on the series as well. I'm not giving a spoiler warning because it's not really possible to spoil Mushishi like that. But, this review will contain plot points from within the series. So it's better if you've already watched it. This will take a really long time. Alright, let's get to the point.
                               My very first review on MAL was of the 2005 anime Mushishi. I mentioned in that review that it was one of my favorite anime of all time Then I found out that there was a 2014 continuation that would be seperated into two 10 episode seasons,2 specials, and a conclusion movie. The subject of this review will be the first 10 episode season of this new saga of mushishi.
                              Alright, back with Mushishi. I'm excited to talk about the things I love about this anime and also where I'm hoping it'll improve in the future, so let's get at it.

44,"Six months ago, Sakuta Azusagawa had a chance encounter with a bunny girl in a library. Ever since then, he’s been blissfully happy with his girlfriend: Mai Sakurajima, that same bunny girl. However, the reappearance of his mysterious first crush, the now-adult Shouko Makinohara, adds a new complication to his relationship with Mai. To make matters worse, he then encounters a middle school Shouko in the hospital, suffering from a grave illness. Mysteriously, his old scars begin throbbing whenever he’s near her.

With Shouko’s bizarre situation somehow revolving around him, Sakuta will need to come to terms with his own conflicting feelings, for better or worse. With a girl's life in his hands, just what can he do?

                              Going to keep this review short. For those who watched the anime series, you already know what you're getting yourself into. All the girls make an appearance and have some sort of role in the story. The main stars, however, are main girl Mai and the mysterious Shouko. And boy, do both of these girls know just what to say and do to pull on the heartstrings of not only MC Sakuta, but also the audience. Both of the girls get fully fleshed out over the course of the movie, and satisfied fans may gain (or keep) some waifus by the end.
                              Rascal Does Not Dream of a Dreaming Girl was an exceptional adaption. I went to the fan preview of this event and if I'm being honest I came into the cinema with not the worlds highest expectations, expecting the movie to be fan service. However, I was gratefully shocked. 
                              Why is this low budget powerpoint presentation with an incoherent plot sitting at an 8.72? Seriously, besides sound, what redeemable aspect is there here?
                              This movie insulted my intelligence.

Why? because the movie was fantastic, brilliant and it perfectly completed the puzzles of life ( referring to the confusionness of the show ) in which made me feel enlightened. Well, what if I told you that the movie no longer has the number #1 spot as the best time travelling anime movie? Or perhaps, to put this in a less offensive term. Does The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya have a newly emerged competitor that is as or better

                               ""Rascal Does Not Dream of a Dreaming Girl"" is the sequel to the 13-episode anime series ""Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai"" that took the internet and otaku world by storm in the forth quarter of 2018 with its flabbergasting title and premise. Adapted from the light novel series with the same name, at first glance it seemed as if it would be another adaptation of an unreasonably long and clickbait title, however it turned out to actually have a beating heart and an interesting direction to take its viewers to. The chemistry between Azusagawa Sakuta and Sakurajima Mai was reminiscing of          
                              Every now and then I will be so excited about something coming out only to be let down by the adaptation. After not knowing what to expect from the Bunny Girl anime going into it initially, like most i thought fan service, I was blown away by the show and everything about it, only wanting to delve deeper into the story. As someone who had knowledge of what was going to happen going into the theater last night to watch the movie. I was skeptical that it wouldn't live up to what I wanted. Lets just say my skepticism was way off the mark. Clover          
                              What started as a cheap way to get viewers hooked on “just another supernatural school anime” became one of the most highly regarded anime of its time, sparking loads of discussion.  Many regard the original anime as having power in its emotional payoffs but incredibly painful with its broken and inconsistent plot.  Having been built upon that already established world, there are two types of people that watched this movie: the type that ignores plot holes and contrivances to focus on character and themes, and the type that look for intellectual consistency in a story.  You either looked forward to enjoying the

66,"Yotarou is a former yakuza member fresh out of prison and fixated on just one thing: rather than return to a life of crime, the young man aspires to take to the stage of Rakugo, a traditional Japanese form of comedic storytelling. Inspired during his incarceration by the performance of distinguished practitioner Yakumo Yuurakutei, he sets his mind on meeting the man who changed his life. After hearing Yotarou's desperate appeal for his mentorship, Yakumo is left with no choice but to accept his very first apprentice.

As he eagerly begins his training, Yotarou meets Konatsu, an abrasive young woman who has been under Yakumo's care ever since her beloved father Sukeroku Yuurakutei, another prolific Rakugo performer, passed away. Through her hidden passion, Yotarou is drawn to Sukeroku's unique style of Rakugo despite learning under contrasting techniques. Upon seeing this, old memories and feelings return to Yakumo who reminisces about a much earlier time when he made a promise with his greatest rival.

Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu is a story set in both the past and present, depicting the art of Rakugo, the relationships it creates, and the lives and hearts of those dedicated to keeping the unique form of storytelling alive.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.6,8,67,654,224779,4935,"                              Shouwa Rakugo is a story about life. It is a story about the art of Rakugo, of Japan's history during the Shouwa era, of friendship and family, and of sacrificing everything to reach one's potential, but particularly it is a story about life— the lives of two talented, troubled and yet ordinary men. 
                              When I sat down to write this review I had a hard time condensing my feelings towards it into written format. This wasn't to say the story was complex; on the contrary, it was rather straightforward on paper. But when I tried to articulate my thoughts to virtual ink, nothing came to fruition. Then after I sat back and let everything that had transpired sink in, it just hit me, a simple word, yet one that was able to properly express the feelings that I had wadded up inside for this title. Simply put, Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu was poetic. 
                              It is truly fascinating of what people are capable of doing to survive in society, especially when you are basically abandoned by your relatives. A young boy who once aspired to be a dancer has no choice but to learn the art of Rakugo, a form of Japanese verbal entertainment in which the storyteller sits on stage while performing a complicated comedical story. Audiences may have had the impression that it solely focuses on the profession, yet this is not the case. At first it seems that it simply served as means of survival, but it becomes apparent that the journey throughout his life was          
                              If you have ever watched stand up comedy or listened to NPR ( This American Life, Fresh Air with Terry Gross, A Prairie Home Companion from Lake Wobegone), you should check this anime out. If not, it's slow, mediocre, and overrated. The reason why it's rated so high is that it's one of those "" at least it doesn't take place in high school"" anime shows. 
                              Overview: 
                              Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu. I have to admit, this show took me by storm. A series about rakugo isn’t something that we see often in the anime industry these days in particular dealing with performances on stage. As such, this series is what I like to describe as a dark horse. And for a lot of reasons, it deserves quite a lot of praise for what is.
                              *Despite both the title, and the first episode spoiling the show in heavy detail, there is so much here to unwind, that I cannot bear not giving you the classic SPOILER warning. Please, watch the show if you haven't; I implore you to do so. For those who have (or those who don't care about spoilers), let's move on*
                              (This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site)
                              Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu has been hyped to me as the best anime of this year. Mature historical drama with amazing voice acting and editing. 
                              A diamond in the rough, that’s for sure. Who could have thought that a show dedicated to the art of sitting down and telling a story could be so engaging? Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu has blown me away with its ability to create a thoroughly fleshed-out cast, packed to the brim with personality. I hung on to every word that was said, and in a show revolving heavily around dialogue, that would be critical to helping the anime hit the mark. The performances are always entertaining but always serve that dual purpose of opening up a window into our characters’ lives and their troubles. This          
                              Rakugo. Essentially, the art of storytelling. But through the course of these 13 episodes, we discover there is so much more to this ancient Japanese art-form. There is great attention to technique, pacing, the teller's voice, the genre of story and so on. What SGRS does is transport us to a time when this beautiful yet under appreciated art-form is stagnant and slowly dying, due to other emerging entertainments such as television. Yet also the stubbornness and pride of the elder Rakugo masters to stick to old traditions and their disdain for anything new and different. 
                              Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu is a historical Josei manga written by Kumota Haruko that began in 2010. Just this year, an anime adaptation aired, being brought to us by Studio Deen. You may recall them as the studio behind Read or Die, Gravitation, The law of Ueki, & Sakura Trick. Just to name some of their series I've looked at. How does this historical drama compare? Let's take a look and see.
                              Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu was definitely not an extremely popular show when it aired. And yet, after a few different sources said that this show was different, but definitely worth watching, I tried it out. And the result was an amazing, sorely underrated show that is incomparable to anything else.
                              To be excellent, an anime doesn't always need to be endowed with great ideas. It doesn't always have to explore overwhelming themes. It doesn't need to have deeper meaning. Sometimes, subtlety and proper execution of everything it does is sufficient to make a masterful series. Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu is such an anime.
                              Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu is the story of two men trying to preserve what they love and themselves in an era where the world around them is constantly evolving. Bon, a boy confronted with the lack of attributes corresponding to his role in society, failed in a path of implausible success in the feminine arts after a lifelong injury and finally abandoned by a cold-hearted mother because of it, pursues in rakugo a cure for the scars of his past. Shin, an orphan raised by the remains of a fallen, forgotten legend, seeks for a change in rakugo alongside the new winds of post-war Japan          ",66
74,"From unraveling the secrets of opening and closing doors to defusing surprise packages more commonly known as bombs, there is never a dull day at the Hololive Production office! Holo no Graffiti follows an eccentric cast of Virtual YouTubers, also known as ""VTubers,"" going about their absurd yet hilarious daily lives, detailing all their cute moments and mishaps.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.58,8,77,3815,18251,1067,"                              I think there's a new potential #1 on MAL. Having been watching anime for many years, I can successfully conclude that this is my second ever 10/10 anime I've ever seen.
                              I think Holo no Graffiti is an exquisite work of art. Every episode, it shows how unconventional that makes you think ""wow that sure is weird huh"" but in actuality it depicts life as it is. No aspects of life are truly conventional, in fact every weird thing that happens in our lifetime happens because the Greater Being grants us the cruel punishment that is life. Another interesting design choice that ""Holo no Graffiti"" shows is the rapid, moving dialogues and animation that is present in most of its episodes. Rather than being done for the sake of comedy, it is actually a reflection of          
                              The anime industry has a long and rich history filled with series, shorts and movies that mark generations and it’s audience in a particular time period. Suchs works were produced thanks to numerous creative minds that were passionate about animation and wanted to be a part of the creative process behind such works.
                              Alright, so, just to preface, this review is coming from someone who hasn't really watched much hololive stuff. I've seen a few clips here and there on YouTube (As most of us have at this point, it's inescapable.) but I haven't exactly dedicated any time to watching full streams or remembering many of the members' names. With that out of the way, here's my review of what I've seen of this little anime.
                              What the fuck is going on? Am I missing a joke? Why is this stuff rated so highly out of nowhere? I have no idea what I just witnissed, I actually want to believe it's all fake.
                              The best work of the aniem of the history, each chapter is a unique experience in which the problems of our current society are explored with good exposition. All the characters have development arcs, good characterization and all are endearing, despite this I feel that the ones that stand out the most are Okayu for his revenge and redemption arc, I also highlight Korone despite his tragic past he manages to walk again thanks to the corpse of the holy body and to Watame who at first did not want to get on the Eva but thanks to her companions she manages to overcome the          
                              While as Hololive (JP, ID, EN included; CN Star excluded) is eventually invincible, Nijisanji should be thrown into the trashtank of VTB history.
                              Ok, so I'm not exactly a fan of Hololive; Not that I have anything against it or v-tubers in general, I just never got into it. I have a vague understanding of some of the more popular characters from memes and stream clips, but I've never sat through one of their streams. I do, however, have an Hololive-obsessed friend who showed me a few of these and now that this show has been added to MAL I am bound by the competitionest's curse to see this through to the very end.  
                              I don't review anime but here, I need to do it.
                              I´ve seen a lot of series, but specifically this one is such an amazing work, i really can't believe how this is that good, every time i see a episode from Holo no Graffiti there is a smile in my face  that I can't get rid of, all the episodes are just as good, all  the characters are so deep that they even have their own  Youtube's channels, is that good that a whole life wouldn't be enough to watch all the content that hololive has to offer.

Following their exploits on the island during summer vacation, Class 3-E continues to sharpen their blades with their sights set on their teacher, the slippery Koro-sensei. They have more to worry about than just their teacher, however, as enemy assassins, both old and new, are out for the increased bounty on the octopus' head.

Moreover, their rivals in Class A, as well as Kunugigaoka Junior High's fearsome principal, stand to block Class E from achieving academic excellence. With all of these obstacles opposing them, the group must continue to work together in order to overcome their foes and accomplish their goal of successfully assassinating their teacher.

Thus, Class 3-E - the only class that teaches assassination - must come to an end, as well, whether the world goes down with it or not. In this season of Assassination Classroom, we get to see how it all ends, making it one of those anime that is actually a full adaptation of the original manga. When I watched the first season last year, I enjoyed it a whole lot; that was more than enough          
                              Mod Edit: This review may contain spoilers.
                              After finishing the first season, I started to question the direction of the story. It had its moments and the comedy was fairly good, but I wasn’t overall very impressed with it. The assassination premise is presented in a colourful and fun manner that it tends to take lightly of its consequences. It glorifies that assassination serves as a way for fellow assassins to create bonds and promote self-improvement. I can’t help but see it as a flaw, given that I’m already used to seinen titles that explore the world of assassination in detail and it’s definitely not all fun and games. The dynamic between          
                              I'm very conflicted about this anime, because on the one hand it is undoubtedly one of the best shows I've ever seen, but on the other hand it features both the most beautiful and most soul-crushing episode in existence.
                              (This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)
                              Now that you're reading this review, I'm assuming that you have already watched Season 1. Season 2 starts questionable but ends with a BOOM, it's better than Season 1 in my eyes.

                              AP classes, or Advanced Placement Classes are a kind of challenge that students put themselves through in order to show that they're the best of the best or much higher level than the rest.  These courses are much faster than their 'less advanced' counterparts, have much more material to them, and are usually less fun.  So why do I make this analogy?  Well, if AssClass S1 is a standard course, AssClass S2 is an AP course.  Case in point, onto the lecture as to why this show isn't as good as people may say it is.
                              STORY: 8/10
                              The story of the Assassination Clasroom is so beautifully written to pass on important messages and morals, about life and death, what it means to be a teacher and connections we have with the world around us. It makes you connect with the characters and feel their emotions from start to finish,you understand their pain as they have been rejected from their normal society for different reasons and you get to know each and every character (despite the amount of them) and its easy to imagine yourselves as part of that. This show is a must watch for anyone, and will touch the hearts of          
                              This is undoubtedly the best anime I've watched in my life thus far, its so unique you can define it as a genre itself, and that's what makes  Ansatsu Kyoushitsu so good
                              Assassination Classroom has now become my favourite anime of all time. The first season makes the entire thing seem like a pure comedy anime , but anyone who has finished both seasons will know this is not the case. The second season is absolutely amazing , just as you think you know how the anime will end there are 2 huge twists in the story. All of the questions are answered in season 2. Assassination Classroom also has very little filler. When a certain activity or situation does take up an entire episode , it is always for a very good reason or important to          
                              After glancing at the scores on the other reviews, it has quickly become clear that I do not share the popular opinion in regards to this season of Assassination Classroom. While I thought the first season was pretty average, I think this season was worse.
                              So season one was good i thought it was very funny but when season two started i  just knew it would be way different because march was coming.
                               The secont season of assassination classroom was great.You learn everyting you need to know about what happented to the past and the story becomes MUTCH better than the first season.",83
106,"Centuries ago, mankind was slaughtered to near extinction by monstrous humanoid creatures called titans, forcing humans to hide in fear behind enormous concentric walls. What makes these giants truly terrifying is that their taste for human flesh is not born out of hunger but what appears to be out of pleasure. To ensure their survival, the remnants of humanity began living within defensive barriers, resulting in one hundred years without a single titan encounter. However, that fragile calm is soon shattered when a colossal titan manages to breach the supposedly impregnable outer wall, reigniting the fight for survival against the man-eating abominations.

After witnessing a horrific personal loss at the hands of the invading creatures, Eren Yeager dedicates his life to their eradication by enlisting into the Survey Corps, an elite military unit that combats the merciless humanoids outside the protection of the walls. Based on Hajime Isayama's award-winning manga, Shingeki no Kyojin follows Eren, along with his adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman and his childhood friend Armin Arlert, as they join the brutal war against the titans and race to discover a way of defeating them before the last walls are breached.

You can understand the anime very well even without having read the manga. However, SNK isn't understood by many because it's a psychological manga .. SNK isn't just a succession of empty and meaningless clashes and, of uncontrolled violence, stereotyped heroes who fight the bad (like Bleach). Here are shown the darkest sides of the human psyche with great mastery: the desire to be the best but can't do it, the

                                        Every once in a while, and even more frequently now than in the past, an anime appears that is completely and unequivocally shrouded in layers upon layers of hype and popularity from the anime community. It's the show that's on everyone lips, as well as everyone's TV screens. In the Fall of 2011, The Future Diary created an exceptional level of hype that had not been seen for quite some time. When the Summer of 2012 rolled along, it was time for Sword Art Online to take the spotlight, and its own popularity grew to          
                              Shingeki no Kyojin... Where do I start?
                              I started watching Shingeki no Kyojin a year ago, almost to the day that I am writing this. So I figured I would write a review on what has grown to be one of my favourite series of all time.
                              Attack on Titan is a particularly unique case for me. As such, my review needs to be broken up to properly analyze it. 
                              So what on earth? What have I done?
                              Let's get straight to it! Shingeki no Kyojin is an incredibly gripping, action packed show, and it is certainly capable of converting non-anime watchers. When you begin to understand the plight of humanity versus the titans, you'll quickly begin to realize that this is a show of epic proportions - essentially it is an inter species war: and violence comes hand in hand with this theme, so squeamish viewers might want to look elsewhere.
                              This anime made my mouth open wide for longer than 5 seconds more than a handful times. This is the type of world where more people get killed than the entirety of the A Song of Ice and Fire series. It exists in a timeless universe – not in the past, present or future of our world, but in a pocket universe where Titans existed long before the existence of machines. In this world, machines were not invented to improve humanity’s lifestyle, but for the continuous existence of humanity itself.
                              The hype of 2013 leading to an ending that closed off lots of action and questions throughout its run. With an anime that has a lot of hype, comes a lot of conflict between haters and people who genuine enjoy the anime. Shingeki no Kyojin is an anime that made peaks in sales and getting fans world wide, but is it really worth watching? 
                              Shingeki no Kyojin is an amazingly written story with a very dark premise and a lot of action. This is definitely not a series for the faint of heart, especially those with fears of man-eating giants that don't even have the decency to kill you before they eat you (sometimes). The story keeps you guessing as it progresses, there's a new reveal that completely destroys what you thought you knew and makes you wonder just how far the rabbit hole goes. The characters are very relatable and you really do want to see them succeed. What makes this series unique however is the protagonists very          
                              It's nice to have an anime this popular that isn't just tsundere school rom-com no' 10746 for a change. But does that alone make said anime great? No, not really.
                              If you’re an anime or manga patron, you’ve more than likely heard of, if you haven’t already read or seen, a series entitled Shingeki no Kyojin (Attack on Titan). Based on the popular manga, Shingeki no Kyojin had been made into an anime in 2013, that had literally taken the entire world by storm. It's even been airing on American Television alongside other popular shows such as One Piece and Naruto. It’s popularity is getting to the point where it’s damn near impossible to say the word “anime” without someone bringing up Shingeki no Kyojin. But is Shingeki no Kyojin worth the hype? 
                              This will be my first ever review on this website, and I figured it best to start with the one series most fresh in my mind.  Attack on Titan was one of the most rewarding anime experiences I've ever had.  Unique premise, serious characters and a vivid soundtrack and art style make the first season of this show one to remember.  I will keep this review spoiler free, as to not ruin the experience for anyone else.
                              It pains me in a way to not give Attack on Titan anything but a 10. I completely understand why this show got so popular so fast. I also understand why everybody is impatiently waiting for season 2. I want to say that it is really as flawless as people say it is.",106

                              The final season for the Monogatari series...I never thought I'd reach this point. This obviously isn't the final show for the series. There's still the 2nd cour for Owarimonogatari, a bunch of Koyomi arcs and Kizumonogatari.
                              To start with the good news, Owarimonogatari is a breath of fresh air in this rather stale year in animes. The bad news? While its second half provides hints of what was the aftermath of Kizumonogatari film to be aired next year, it is one of the worse arcs in the Monogatari universe.
                              Story + Overview 10 / 10
                              Love it, hate it, indifferent to it, or once-loved-then-hated-now-extremely indifferent to it, Owarimonogatari (literally 'end story', though the series doesn't conclude here) will most likely meet your expectations of the long-running light novel adaptation. For me, that means occasionally witty dialogue shoehorned with ecchi, traces of pedophilia, and genuinely interesting ideas muffled by execution. And yup, it's got all three. NisiOisiN really knows how to keep his writing consistent! 
                              Owarimonogatari is the telling of two stories. The first one is about Oikura Sodachi, which is a long lost friend of Koyomi Araragi; the other is about Shinobu Oshino.

                              (This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)
                              Many people who gave this monogatari series or owarimonogatari a lower than average rating, let me say this. The meaning of ""owari"" or the prefix name of this monogatari means the resolution or the end of something. By this sense, many of the monogatari that we saw with its prefix name tells you, and predetermine what you are about to see, within those monogatari series that will entails as its main theme or topic of the anime's discussion or introductory standpoints, until it meets it resolution or the end of that specific monogatari series. And if you notice something about this owarimonogatari series. Both shinobu's          
                              Now this installment of the Monogatari series was fairly odd, since it tried to incorporate new characters as well as one old character that we don't know too much about. The show is split up into two stories, both being six episodes long. Although both stories are under the same title (Owarimonogarati) they don't really have anything to do with each other. 
                              Here we are with my fanboy review of another installment of the monogatari series. This series definitely stands out from heaps of other anime with very few series being like it. At first people might go into this series thinking its supposed to be something super artsy with hidden messages and metaphors everywhere but honestly all it does is take a fairly generic story and take a new approach with it. People criticize this series for its lack of character development and plot. A lot of these people  watched 3 episodes and quit. Character development in this series is actually very interesting. The main          
                                    I'll start off by saying that I initially had a higher opinion of Owarimonogatari in the first hour or so after I finished it.  While I still really enjoyed the series overall, my impression weakened after I gave it a bit more thought.  While many reviews break this show up into 3-4 mini storylines, there are really only two true arcs.  The first one revolving around the mysterious background of Oikura Sodachi was far superior to the second arc centering on Shinobu and the reincarnation of her first kin, and I'll explain why in my story          
                              I was highly disappointed with Owarimonogatari. In my opinion it was a major step down compared to the rest of the series/stories. I thought if I gave it more time that maybe there would be a better chance of me liking it and changing my rating, however to my disappointment it did just the opposite. 
                              Owarimonogatari is yet another installment in the adaptation of the Monogatari LN series. This follows 3 stories, two of which focus on one character exclusively and resolve in a way that's both satisfactory and at the same time, kind of disappointing. The VA's of the focal female characters are doing their own openings with exception given (yet again) to Maaya Sakamoto. Decent Black strikes the nerves a funny bit the first few listens, but it soon becomes catchy and you find yourself obsessively looking it up on youtube. Mathemagics on the other hand, has a rather James Bond-esque feel to it that works really well          ",107

Long ago, a Mushi of terrifying power threatened to extinguish all life. The Minai clan of Mushishi were born from those who stopped this malevolent force, their members bound by duty to serve as retainers to the Karibusa family, within whom the Mushi remains sealed. The Mushishi Ginko is given a job request from Tanyuu Karibusa: oversee the work of the head of the Minai clan, Kumado Minai, in investigating an abandoned village where dead wood and even houses spring back to life as flourishing plants.

Though the Minai clan are oddly ruthless among Mushishi, even more peculiar is their widespread dull character, with little appreciation for beauty or sentiment. Tanyuu believes there is more to this trend than meets the eye. Ginko aims to answer her curiosity as he follows Kumado into a ""Path of Thorns,"" a place where Mushi flow from their own strange sources into the world of the living. Rare and deadly varieties of Mushi lurk in these depths, along with the secret nature of the Minai clan's resolve to their ancient task.

We always feel that death is such an alien concept, it exists but is somehow detached and unrelated to our own little world until it comes knocking on our doorstep. Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai (We Still Don't Know the Name of the Flower We Saw That Day), tries to show us just how powerful an effect death can have on us.
                              What do you do, when you suddenly see a ghost of a person that you were close to? Most people would think it's just their imagination or the effect of stress. But what if your mind doesn't play tricks on you and you really encounter a ghost from the past? AnoHana plays with this idea. The story starts out on a usual day for the shut-in Jinta, who suddenly sees the ghost of his childhood friend Menma. Menma tells Jinta she has a wish that she wants to be granted by him. And from here on, Jinta's unusual summer starts.

                              In this review I will defend the claim that ""Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai"" is an absolutely terrible show.  It is well known that this show get's a lot of positive attention.  At the time of this write-up, it is currently ranked 42nd on the site overall (or, if the site had good programmers, 39th since Gintama 2015, Unlimited Bladeworks season 2, and One Punch Man are above it and have not even aired any episodes), with a weighted score of 8.70.  It is often discussed in forums as being a tear jerker.  Indeed, there          
                              I don't often follow currently airing shows. It's usually hard to tell which shows are genuinely good until the hype dies down a bit. But under intense peer pressure, I started following a certain series this season. That show is ""Deadman Wonderland"". To cut a long story short, it sucked. So to deal with the disappointment I decided to follow another series, the sleeper hit ""Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai"", which apparently translates roughly to ""We Still Don't Know the Name of That Flower We Were Smoking When We Came Up With This Title"". Something like that. With a

                              Death of a close friend is always difficult to deal with, mainly because it always comes when you least expect it. It is especially hard to portray it accurately in any medium, let alone anime. When I first heard of Anohana, I was expecting a beautiful story about a group of friends coming to accept the death of their beloved friend and eventually becoming better people. I was sorely mistaken. Anohana is a travesty of writing and I have no idea why this deserved any praise whatsoever.
                              I watched Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai (I will call it Anohana in this review) after all the episodes had aired so I didn't have to wait for each episode. I saw a lot of posts about this on tumblr so I decided to give it a try. 
                              Ano Hina has a charming premise and interesting first few episodes. A lot of times in the later of the series there are tear-jerking moments. However I was a little disappointed with how it played out in the end. Of course, I stuck with it until the end because there was something sweet about it.
                              I begin this review with informing you.
                              In youth, we tend to over-exaggerate, over-analyse, and over-experience any event. That ice cream we ate for the first time as a child will never quite taste that good again; even as teenagers and later adults, we chase after these childhood fantasies, never quite giving up on finding that metaphorical ""fountain of youth."" What's the most likely thing, then, to happen if one were to experience childhood trauma? Perhaps insanity in later life, a cold heart, apathy, denial, or maybe all of the above? What exactly does happen? Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai explores this phenomenon that happens when          
                              At first AnoHana didn't catch my attention at all. I thought it was a plotless anime about a group of friends who spend their summer with each other. When I ran out of ongoing anime I could look forward to during my week, I decided to try this one. I realized that I had completely underestimated this show.
                              After finishing Anohana, I could only think of one thing -
                              Why? why this garbage of a show has 8.5 score?!!

                              Ah, it's nice to be back in the world of Natsume Yuujinchou. Legitimately, within the first few minutes of experiencing this lovely story, I just felt instantly relaxed and calm. I missed that feeling, so I'm glad I finally got to watch this movie. 
                              I'm going to save you from reading the usual fuzz that you can read in every other review ever on Natsume Yuujinchou. I mean, it's Natsume. You already know what Natsume Yuujinchou is.
                              At last, after almost 9 months from the original release, this movie was subtitled. This movie was honestly really cute, and really gave off that Natsume vibe! So, here I am with my very first review.
                              The movie is basically an arc equivalent to 3-4 episodes of the series.It starts with Natsume returning a name of a youkai from the yuujinchou which initiates a turn of events leading into the plot of the movie.
                              Basically it's a regular series episode that's a bit longer, with even better drawn environments, which is awesome.
                              After a long wait, here it is, the subbed version of the movie we've all been waiting for. (Spoiler-free)
                              Overall Grade: 9
                              The fleeting nature of relationships between youkai and humans has been a recurring theme within Natsume Yuujinchou. It's been explored in various ways, through different perspectives, and Ephemeral Bond is a very welcomed addition to the canon. The closing lines of the fifth season goes, ""We know the flowers' petals will fall someday, and yet still, we are entranced by them."" This perfectly captures a running motif of the show. The risk/inevitability of pain is not enough to outweigh the opportunity to be happy and to live, even if it's only for a moment. It also examines the dichotomy between Natsume and Reiko's opposing philosophies          
                              I'm going to go against the grain and rate this move poorly compared to other people as well as compared to how I would rate the Natsume series overall.",136

                              Shingeki no Kyojin: No Regrets/Kuinaku Sentaku is  a spin-off of the ever popular Attack on Titan on which our beloved supporting character Levi finally gets a main role.  This shows the flashback of Levi before joining the Survey Corps. You don't really need to watch AOT first if you want to watch this.

I'll try my best to be as vague as possible to avoid spoilers, but I'll post warnings just in case. 
                              This is probably the best content in the AOT universe, and beyond a shadow of a doubt the best OVA produced in the series.

                              It is an enjoyable anime that gives a glimse of one of Attack on Titan's favorite character Levi's past. I find it interesting to see how the Underground works and looks.
                              It is a crime that these two episodes were not included in the main show. While you do get some of Levi's backstory later in season 3, rewatching the show after watching these two episodes made me appreciate Levi and Erwin as characters so much more.
                                  I have got to say that ever since I read the manga and found out about the release of this OVA I've been anxiously waiting for the occasion to watch it. It's hard to say that the story impressed me, and you'll see for yourself whether you think the same or not. Of course, nothing can beat the ingenuity of the titan-related stuff, not even something from Levi's mysterious past, although we get to see a side of him that we didn't really get a glimpse of in the original anime. The other characters play an important role in his development,          ",149

What I thought to be watching was a modern Lupin, it ended becoming the classic 'predictable but not fun' kind of story. I wanted to like it and say originals aren't always bad... I couldn't.
                              I have never felt so compelled to write a review about an anime until I watched the end of Great Pretender. 
                              We will, we will mislead you.
                              Great Pretender has a decent soundtrack, and the art is quite pleasing, but these things don't matter when the story is poor. The emotional/dramatic scenes were well done, but I couldn't take it seriously knowing how absurd the plot was. If you don't get too hung up on how well the plot is written, you might enjoy it, but it was dreadful for me.
                              Man, in all of my years watching anime, I've never watched such a good show that left me with such a bad taste in my mouth. Before I get into the meat and potatoes of my review, let me first say that I will try to avoid spoilers for those of you who aren't watching the sub online off of Netflix, since the final arc isn't available on US Netflix yet. Furthermore, a lot of my harsher scores in the story, character, and enjoyment areas are heavily influenced by the final arc, and especially the ending, so if you don't want to be jaded before

                              THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS
                              People often like to dramatize how they feel about any given show for the sake of being theatrical, but I'm telling the truth when I say that the Great Pretender is one the best, and most dissapointing anime I've seen.
                              I haven't seen any comments about Great Pretender yet, but I can already foresee the many free praise for his art, which consists of a palette of colors quite different from the usual, but which does not suit the unity of the rest of the work at all.
                              The Great Pretender was fucking incredible. Without getting into spoiler territory, all I can really say is... it's one of the smartest anime out there. I know I sound like a goddamned Rick and Morty fan when I say that, but believe me. Everything about is top notch. The animation is incredible, the characters are realistic and relatable, and most importantly, the heists are incredibly well thought out. It's definitely worth your time.
                              Great Pretender was an anime i was excited to watch due to Wit Studio and the general hype around it. After waiting a few months due to work, i finished the anime and boy was i disappointed. The anime is essentially a ""i predicted this prediction to happen"" and everything goes all according to Laurent's plan. I am aware it's an anime but the general ""villains"" of the anime are essentially robots taking orders from Laurent as they do everything according to plan. It doesn't exactly help that they throw away the whole plot of the anime at the final episode where Edamura magically has          
                              I loved the Show it was suspenseful fun, and is great for a binge watch or a slow burn. One of the only bad things that I can say about the show is that one or 2 of the episodes feels repetitive. But after that it keeps its momentum. The characters were cool, and a the main character is a so enjoyable to see him scheme fail, and succeed.  if you like shows like kakeguri, kaiji, or other suspense filled shows this will quickly become an all time favorite. The art is amazing every establishing shot, or just a still from an episode is

                              Well this is definitely a great revenge story(kind off).
                              Great Pretender is a masterclass in weaving a spider’s web of intricacies, all intended to dispatch a missive to an interconnected, worldwide audience, thrilled by the conceits of exploitation and retribution, whilst concurrently lacking understanding of our inherent malleability and tendency to form absolute judgements without successive evaluation.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.37,8,172,439,319566,5406,"                              2021 is definitely a year that will be monopolized by Fantasy animes, and honestly, if most of them are like ""Mushoku Tensei"" I really don't mind. Competing with ""Tensura S02"" and ""So I'm a Spider, So What?"" Mushoku Tensei easily (in my opinion) outstands them with better character development and amazing art. They actually make you feel bad about the main character with his past life being so fucked up and seeing him in this new life overwhelming his fears gets you closer to the story. Something we can say other ""Reincarnation"" type animes definitely fail at. 
                              A story about a middle-aged pedophile that is reincarnated in a fantasy world where everything is conveniently set up so he can make all his pedo dreams come true without the legal and moral obstacles of the modern world.
                              I went in blind when I started this show. Didn't know anything about it, and was pleasant surprised by how good it is. It's charming, funny, and gives you interesting characters for sure. Defo one of the better isekai's for sure, and for good reason.
                              I haven't seen such a mess for ages. For real I don't know why this good looking shit has so high score. But lets go:
                              I know that I can't analyze the anime exactly by watching only 4 episodes, but this is my initial conclusion: 
                              This show was one of my more anticipated of the season going into it. Isekai stories are a fair bit played out at this point, but I really liked the nuance it seemed to be giving as to what made this rebirth a second chance. delving into topics such as mental trauma and overcoming obstacles of a more personal nature then your typical fantasy wish filament story. The only problem is those topics, as well as others of a more serious nature, are handled with the delicacy of drop kicking a baby down a flight of stairs. 
                              SO I'm a little biased because I have read the manga and Web Novel. BUT. I have to give this story a 10/10 as of right now and here's why.
                              Mushoku Tensei is a superbly well animated garbage. That is the reason I give this anime a 3 instead of a 1 or 2.
                              My background:
                              ""IsekaiHood, the Anime""
                              There are more number of isekai anime now a days. I heard many saying this is just another isekai. Guys now here this out ""THIS IS NOT ANOTHER ISEKAI ANIME"" , This is the best ever isekai (a.k.a GOD FATHER of isekai). I just read the manga which was ongoing at chapter 68, the story was so exciting so actually moved to read the light novel also finished it.... believe it or not, This anime has best story(saying form novel reader).
                              Reincarnated to have another chance... at being a disgusting person.
                              Before I start this review, I really don't want to talk about the greats of this series as most other reviews will be addressing already, so if you want to know about why you SHOULD watch this series, read another review. Instead, I will be addressing (and debunking) some of the reasons other people will tell you to not watch this show.
                              What can I say, it checks all the boxes for a fantasy anime and an isekai. 
                              To start this review i'm just going to be outright. I love this series. I first started reading the LN and WN around a year ago due to general boredom and i must say it was a rather good decision. The anime adaptation is everything i'd thought it would be and more.",155
157,"While playing in the snow one day at her shrine, the land god Nanami Momozono witnesses her familiar—the fox youkai Tomoe—collapse, with dark markings appearing on his body. Tomoe's former master, Lord Mikage, appears after his long absence and places Tomoe into a magical pocket mirror in order to stave off his ailment.

Mikage explains that long ago, before he and Tomoe had met, the fox youkai was in love with a human woman. Seeking to live as a human with his beloved, he made a deal with a fallen god, but he only ended up cursed and dying. When Mikage discovered Tomoe, the god made the youkai forget his human love as a quick solution. However, something has changed recently to reactivate the curse; Tomoe has fallen in love with his new human master, Nanami. Since there is no way to stop the curse, Nanami wants to stop Tomoe from getting cursed in the first place by traveling back through time, even if it means they may never meet. As Nanami travels back hundreds of years to save her precious familiar, she discovers that she is far more closely bonded to Tomoe than she previously thought.

                              It was so good I actually cried.  (Rarely cries when watching tv shows or movies)
                              I fell deeply in love with all the episodes of Kamisama Hajimemashita from Season 1 to 2 to its OVA version. I love the development of the two main characters; from enemies to friends, and eventually, to lovers. Unlike, the many animes that I have seen, the streak of independence, wit, kind-heartedness, positivity, and charm in Nanami was a welcome change from the dimwitted and damsel-in-distress qualities that female leads in this genre have been stereotyped with. Same with Tomoe, who, though initially had difficulty wearing his heart on his sleeve, still managed to overcome the usual cold and steely demeanor, which often characterized anime          
                              First things first, don't expect to feel ""satisfied"" with the ending after watching this. Reading the manga is so much better in terms of furthering the plot with Nanami, Tomoe, and Akura-ou. 
                              I'm going to assume you've watched season 1 and 2 before reading this.
                              Before I start, this is my first review, so it might suck. Also, I've read the manga volumes that this four part OVA covers, so take that how you want to. 
                              Ok, i know the anime hasn't finished yet, but i have read the manga so i know how much i love it already and if you have an issue with this review just go to the next one. It is hard to talk about it without giving anything away, but ill do my best!
                              I'm a big fan of this anime series, and have read the manga, so I know what happens throughout these four episodes. On one hand I'm happy to be able to continue this series, but on the other I'm not sure how this will span out considering in the manga it is the part of this series that is the most romance filled , and so spreading it through only 4 half an hour episodes may feel rushed. Hopefully not.
                              Well first of all, all i can say about this anime is AWESOME OMG!! LOVE IT SOO MUCH!!",157

169,"Toua Tokuchi is an athlete by profession, but a reckless gambler at heart. On the streets of Okinawa, he uses nothing but his wits and a ""fastball"" peaking at a mere 134 kmph to somehow achieve 499 wins in the game of ""One Outs,"" a simplified version of baseball between the pitcher and one batter. Amazed by Toua's unique prowess on the mound, veteran slugger Hiromichi Kojima artfully scouts the pitcher for his long unsuccessful team, the Saikyou Saitama Lycaons. Kojima desperately hopes Toua will lead them to the championship; however, Tsuneo Saikawa, the mercenary owner of the Lycaons, sees the vastly talented pitcher as a threat to the income generated by the team. Rising to the challenge of swaying the owner, Toua suggests a one-of-a-kind ""One Outs"" contract: every out Toua pitches will earn him five million yen, but with every run he gives up, he will lose fifty million yen.

Adapted from the manga by Shinobu Kaitani of Liar Game fame, One Outs documents the intense psychological battles between Toua and those around him. With millions of yen at stake, can a pitcher who has done nothing but gamble in a head-to-head imitation of baseball finally lead a real baseball team to victory?

Its very similar to Akagi, so if you enjoyed that the chances are VERY slim that you wont enjoy this one as well!
                              ""Winner takes all. This is the universal rule of battle."" - Toua Tokuchi. 
                              Pen is mightier than sword, that is what we learn from one outs. From the synopsis one may be confused that Is this baseball? Is this chess? Is this gambling? The answer is Nope its not, its ONE OUTS. Bored of animes with cliche MC, who either suck at everything and gradually develops into a strong character or suddenly gets a powerboost to defeat all his foes, or in the name of friends brings out some kind of hidden power, and stuff, then u r definitely looking for this awesomesauce.
                              Shit.
                              One Outs was a baseball manga written by Kaitani Shinobu. It was adapted into an anime by our old friends at Madhouse, who brought us such classics as Black Lagoon, Petshop of Horrors and Rideback. Unfortunately, they've also been behind some of the worst anime I've ever seen such as Highschool of the Dead and Devil Hunter Yohko. I'm honestly not predicting their best work this time around, although a lot of that is more to do with the subject matter than anything else. I am not a person who cares about sports in the slightest. So, let's look at One Outs and see if          
                              It can be difficult to find a good mind game anime that doesn’t water down the suspense. One Outs is a classic example of this. The story follows our main character Toua Tokuchi who loves two things: baseball and gambling. He plays for a team and demonstrates his skills in both pitching and out thinking his opponents. The show has a darker theme given its more mature art style and character design similar to that of Akagi and Kaiji.
                              ""Winning a game is not dependent on surpassing your opponents with your strength or waiting for lucky breaks. Conquer the opponent, crushing them, and stepping over the fallen ones ruthlessly. Winning means dominating over countless dead bodies.""
                              This anime was partially enjoyable, but my enjoyment was mostly overshadowed by what I see as failed potential. One Outs starts out with a world of potential with the interesting and enigmatic main character, genius pitcher Tokuchi Toua. The supporting characters are interesting as well and immediately given impressive backstory and development. The atmosphere seemed to be setting up for a great baseball journey and even the narrator promised that great unforeseen events would happen later on. However, after the first few introductory episodes the series levels out and becomes uninteresting focusing on one long match after another. Many people say this series is like          
                              Hands down my favorite anime.  I've rewatched it twice and if it were possible to erase my memories of what happens in this anime, I would likely rewatch it many more times.  Now, without further ado...
                              ""A low possibility doesn't mean its zero"" 
                              “Winning is about trampling over corpses… It's not something beautiful. It's brutal. If you want to make it to the top- Steel yourselves.”
                              this isn't really a sports anime, despite using baseball as a vehicle, and it isn't really a gambling show either, despite the lead character Tokuchi being an inveterate gambler.  it is primarily a sort of mystery -- i got the most out of trying to figure out what Tokuchi was thinking, and how he would foil his enemies.
                              *Note* This is my first review, so any feedback on how I can make it better/more useful to the reader is greatly appreciated :), thanks in advance.
                              Who said gamble mixed with sport isn't good enough? Well, those who have opinion like that should consider to watch One Outs. As the synopsis above, One outs is mostly about gambling in baseball world. Yes, gamble and baseball. Although, the gamble in this term isn't about manipulating score or something like that, it's more one on one gamble, in this term it's Touma vs the club owner.
                              One Outs was an overall enjoyable series that was definitely worth the watch. It contained an interesting and rather original premise, and captured my attention from the early episodes. However, it was not without it's flaws.",169

                              It is so rare to find any type of short series that span under 13 episodes without declining in quality over its duration due to various factors such as the abundance of inconsistencies in the story, or rehashing the same narrative structural wise, which is pretty common in short running series. Other limiting factors are the available funds for its execution, or its own popularity, which can induce authors to change the course of the story.

181,"Kino, a 15-year-old traveler, forms a bond with Hermes, a talking motorcycle. Together, they wander the lands and venture through various countries and places, despite having no clear idea of what to expect. After all, life is a journey filled with the unknown. 

Throughout their journeys, they encounter different kinds of customs, from the morally gray to tragic and fascinating. They also meet many people: some who live to work, some who live to make others happy, and some who live to chase their dreams. Thus, in every country they visit, there is always something to learn from the way people carry out their lives. 

It is not up to Kino or Hermes to decide whether these asserted values are wrong or right, as they merely assume the roles of observers within this small world. They do not attempt to change or influence the places they visit, despite how absurd these values would appear. That's because in one way or another, they believe things are fine as they are, and that ""the world is not beautiful; therefore, it is.""

                              What do you say about an anime that is just about a traveler, journeying to different countries on the back of her talking motorcycle.  Sounds boring, right?  WRONG!!!  This episodic anime, through odd little stories and dialogue, actually explores different aspects of human nature, in one of the most unique ways I have ever seen.
                              I stumbled onto this anime without knowing what to expect. Once I started watching it, I became very moved by it.
                              One of the biggest criticisms the anime medium constantly faces is that it merely a form of entertainment.  With the abundance of shows, especially in the recent years, that are evidently nothing more than blatant attempts to cater to hormone-overflowing young men with endless amounts of fanservice, it is easy to see why many skeptics share this common misconception.  And while there are numerous titles that break the mold and provide watchers with much more than just flashy action sequences featuring gun-toting, well-endowed girls, a great deal are quickly forgotten, destined to only be watched by a small fraction of individuals who are          
                              These 13 episodes are packed with compelling storylines all revolving around the character of Kino who is journeying from fictional country to country on her motorbike.
                              “Someone once told me that watching the birds made them want to go on a journey.”
                              Title: Kino no Tabi: The Beautiful World
                              I was reminded of some lines I'd long since forgotten:
                              Overview:
                              It's difficult to sum up Kino's Journey in words. The only  words that come close are unique and stunning. The premise is simple. It follows the journey of a traveler and her talking motorcycle as they travel from place to place and encounter many unusual cultures and customs in the process. However, this simple summary falls short of giving a potential viewer any deep sense of what they're about to see. Each episode explores elements of society and human nature with a rare sense of beauty, touching upon the addressed themes with a sense of pathos that entire series dedicated to them may fail          
                              A journey can be a pivotal point in a person’s life.  It provides an opportunity for a person to experience a new world where they encounter new ideas and do things they have never done before.  More importantly, a journey allows is a time of self-discovery.  Interacting with a new culture forces a person to evaluate their own beliefs and customs that may seem natural to them, but may soon learn they are not intuitive.  It is also an opportunity to see that there are things that are universal for all cultures.  It is this power that a journey has          
                              ""Warning: Kino's Journey has been known to induce a strong feeling of wanderlust in its viewers. It has also been proven to boost levels of empathy. Watch at your own risk.""
                              My shorthand way of describing Kino’s Journey is that it’s Aesop’s Fables the Anime. The characters do not act like real humans, nor do their dialogue and actions seem like those of normal humans. That is because it is not a story about people. It’s a story about society. It’s about democracy and religion and work and the things we take for granted because we do not question these societal constructs.

Each of these teams possesses a member of the Generation of Miracles, and Seirin prepares to face the largest obstacles on their path to winning the Winter Cup.

In the final season of Kuroko no Basket, Kuroko goes head-to-head with his old teammates once more as he attempts to show them that individual skill is not the only way to play basketball. His firm belief that his form of basketball, team play, is the right way to play the sport will clash with the talents of a perfect copy and an absolute authority.

While Kuroko tries to prove that his basketball is ""right,"" he and the rest of Seirin High ultimately have one goal: to win the Winter Cup and overcome the strength of the Generation of Miracles, who have long dominated the scene of middle and high school basketball.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.34,8,197,229,514779,4549,"                              At this point, Kuroko no Basket (Kuroko’s Basketball) is a series that needs no introduction. After two seasons of competitive gameplay, we have the third and final season to conclude the entire story based off the manga written by Tadatoshi Fujimaki. If you’re really anxious to see how the Winter Cup will be decided and who will earn the ultimate glory, then this is a must-see for KnB fans. Otherwise, I confess to myself that the third season is a bit of a hit or miss.
                              Finally... I got to finish this anime. Even few hours after I finished watching, adrenaline still overflowing inside of me. I really enjoy this season. Okay, before reviewing, I have read all the manga chapters before the anime even started the third season. Even though I did enjoy reading it, I was not that hyped up for the ending... but the anime did the reverse. With solid story as the base, characters we have grown to love, animated in such an astounding way, this is one of the rare case when I feel more enjoyment with the anime. 
                              First of all, I will clear things out by saying, that I am a big fan of season 1 & 2 of this anime series. I liked almost everthing about those two anime. Eventhough with such a great prequels the third season felt a bit too repetitive. While watching this anime I felt like I have watched the same things in season one & two. The thing that I loved about the first two seasons was character development which was somewhat missing in season 3. The story is good and it give the whole in depth backstory of all the players. This backstory helps viewer          
                              I'm gonna say it and i'm gonna say it now: KnB is the most predictable, shounen-like and overrated anime i have ever seen. We all know why it's rated so high: it is very enjoyable and flashy. It's like a weak version of Bleach, with more cliches and totally unjustified powers, since we're talking about basketball, not shinigamis.
                              Brilliance, that's the most accurate term I can think of when describing pathetic Kuroko no Basket anime series. To me it's something so exciting and so addicting that I can't help but love it, even for someone who doesn't really care for basketball such as myself. Basically what the third season of this series covers is the Generation of miracle's lives in middle school and the conclusion of the winter cup. So what does this season do correctly? Well season 3 doesn't only supply character development, it introduces an awesome character namely Akashi. What makes Akashi great character is his whole split personality characteristic, and          
                              *If you haven't watch the series yet, see my first season review instead. I also won't repeat the things I've said from my first season review.
                              This is my very first review EVER, so please bear with me. KnB is the first sports anime I've ever seen and actually finished. Starting from season one all the way til the last episode I literally just cried over twenty minutes ago. This story is great, you never get bored and it keeps you on the edge of your seat, believe me. The art is AMAZING! I'm a sucker for vibrant colors and good animations. The art is smooth and fits very well with the show. The sound is perfect. It adds to the intensity of the show and the emotions. All of the          
                              I can't believe it just ended like that. I'm like nooo if anyone saw Akatsuki no Yona it ended just like that but in a different way of course. I just felt it ended to fast and man I wish it could be more. Anyway, I loved the skits the series had and the characters where reminiscing. The action. Movements. And Everything about it XD my favorites are Aomine and Kuroko since they're full of surprises and there reactions are priceless when the unexpected happens. The art in this anime is amaazing it really fits for a 2014-2015 anime and the sounds you can hear

                              Edit: Review has been updated to when I have seen all the series' three seasons and even rewatched it:
                              I just want to start off by explaining my stance on sports anime. For the most part I tend to dislike them. It's not that I don't like sports, in fact I partake in both tennis and golf in real life on a regular basis. My issue with a lot of sports anime is that they tread a strange line between trying to be realistic and give an accurate presentation of that sport whilst stretching the realism of said presentation to the limits. This grey area between fiction and non-fiction often results in a uninvestable environment. My other big problem with sports anime is the

                              For a person who did not accompany the novel, this ONA was absurdly incredible, without words, the new animation was very pleasing to me.
                              Disclaimer: Novel reader > Biased
                              Awesome anime about the world of the professional game industry. As a fan of this type of events. I loved the anime and this Special episodes. 
                              The first season has had growing pains and, fortunately, the lessons learned have been incorporated. The first episode of the ONA is a confident, competent stride with all-around better animation and direction. It now uses creative ways and shot angles to help express the emotions of a moment and that presents one of the biggest leaps of the franchise coming from Season 1’s piss-poor direction and a tendency to telegraph everything to the viewer, sometimes in the most obnoxious slapstick way possible, reinforced by the janky animation of that season. Here, however, the motions are more fluid and subdued. And it’s a much better product          
                              *Spoilers Ahead, (though seriously if you watched it already then its fine)*
                              I was planning to watch just 1 episode at a time, but I was glued to the screen and watched all three back to back.
                              As a short ova follow on to the main show of The King's Avatar Aka Quanzhi Gaoshou Tencent has done a great job, The story follows on and leaves you wanting more.
                              Even tho I loved the first season and was looking towards this full of hopes and full of excitement, it ws rather disapointing. 
                              Having loved the first season, i was very eager to see this second season.
                              EDIT: Just finished watching the last ep, and it was quite the suprise. Much of my review still is the same. Others may disagree and they are certainly entitled to that ;)
                              For having spent a year on three episodes, some parts of the animation is rather disappointing, especially episode 1. I can see a lot of people being turned off from it after that episode. But the parts where you can tell that's where they put all their money into, i.e. Gao Yingjie vs Wang Jiexi, the animation and the style used there is amazing. Fortunately, the quality of the episodes gets better after that. ",204

",8.31,8,224,123,732596,6838,"                              Childhood is a blossoming period of learning and developing one's own idiosyncrasies. It has always been a sedate stage in which little youngsters define themselves through their senseless antics—ones that appear innocent but are of an elusive nature, and are merely an inadvertent expression of the capricious phase that is childhood. However, since kids are so full of youthful tendencies, very few directors have managed to portray the rascals in a sincere and realistic manner. But among those select few is an irreplaceable Ghibli film which has become a sensation both within its native community and the western world—and that film is Hayao Miyazaki's My          
                              I remember Totoro was my favorite anime. I'd pop it in the VCR player (yes, old school, I know) and watching it with my little brother when I was a little girl. Somewhere around 14 years later, it's still my favorite movie, and probably always will be.
                              Another win for Miyazaki!
                              It's often easy to get carried away in the everyday vices and tribulations of life. We often want to reminisce and look back on the better days, full of adventure and enjoyment. Well, this movie does an excellent job of bringing me back to that feeling. It is full of heart-whelming adventure, and exploration.
                              My Neighbor Totoro is a wonderful telling of child curiosity with some sprinkles of coming of age. It's surprisingly flat on plot, but I can't really tell you what I was expecting. I wanted... more, but I don't know why. It was a perfectly fine film. The story is really cute, the characters are really cute and compelling. It looks amazing, but for some reason, I was expecting Spirited Away. This is nowhere near that. This is the last Miyazaki review I do for a while. Nothing really seems to have the same impact on me as Spirited Away. It's disappointing.           
                              My Neighbor Totoro is the flagship of Ghibli and one of the first Japanese animated feature films to receive wide critical acclaim in the west. As much as its successor 'Spirited Away' capitalized further in terms of revenue, Totoro stands as one of the most influential anime, with the ubiquitousness of Totoro plushies and pop culture references to it still present today. But there are reasons beyond its success that attributes it as a must watch on the checklist of any avid fan of anime. 
                              I was down with the flu and I was curled up in my room, looking for something cozy to watch. Flipping through my collection, I suddenly remembered the My Neighbor Totoro DVD I had received as a gift a while back. Needless to say, I popped it into my player, sat back and had one of the most relaxing and peaceful 90 minutes of my life.
                              Tonari no Totoro - Would be one of the best Animes I saw when I saw little.
                              What more can be said about My Neighbor Totoro? Get this movie. Immediately. Without a doubt one of the best animated features ever made, Japan or otherwise, Totoro is an outstanding original creation from Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli.
                              My Neighbour Totoro begins with a cheerful ride of a family of three: two young girls and their father. The vast, watery fields, reflecting the morning light, as well as a distinct, towering forest pass by in a flash. Shortly after, the trio arrives at the steps of what's to become their new home.
                              My Neighbor Totoro is a weird movie. It's also one of Hayao Miyazaki's first directorial works as well as his first film with Studio Ghibli. Totoro is often cited as classic anime, but is it really any good? It's hard for me to say; I'm not a big fan of Miyazaki or family movies. It's a bit melodramatic, though some people would rephrase it as touching. It's hard to relate to the main characters because they're so annoying! They seem to yell all the time. My Neighbor Totoro also has Miyazaki's signiture trippy scenes, such as Totoro with the umbrella and the catbus. While I

                              Sigh...How should I describe my most cherished and precious childhood memory of my whole life so that I wouldn't understate it at all?!?!
                              STORY: My Neighbor Totoro is simple and whimsical. Although the story is a children's fable, the heart of the tale can draw out the child in everyone. The movie begins in a period of transition for a family, and the movie concludes alongside the end of the transition. The finished product is like a meaningful photograph. The events occurring in the story or picture are not life changing. It's the memory and feeling you take away that holds the worth of the story in Totoro. However, the story is not ground-breaking or awe-inspiring.  But the it is delightful and unforgettable.",208

The one about which a classic said, “If cancer were pretentious, it would be Garden State.” Wonder Egg Priority with its bumbling attempts to be profound invokes the same familiar feeling of a student movie way over its head.
                              Wonder Egg has come, and it's hit so many marks and boundaries, it's unreal. No matter where I go, no matter who I talk to when it comes to WE, it's always in a positive tone. Even I recommended it to a friend, and they enjoyed it too. That's the quality of Wonder Egg. Really top notch stuff, but let me explain why this is the case within this review.
                              This review might be what I understood and what I believe it would be or could be about this anime. Before anything I want to say that don't get scammed by just the slice of life tag... it more than that, I can assure.
                              Overall: 9/10
                              *TRIGGER WARNING* (very slight spoilers too)
                              Wonder Egg Priority is a pretentious mess that tries to sell itself as a deep and complicated story, but remains in the end another waifubait show. It brings to the table a lot of ""hot topics"" such as school bullying, teen suicide, sexism and sexual harassment, but never explores them in depth, it just throws more and more OMG SO DARK twists without any attempt to give them a meaningful context or resolution. 
                              TL;DR
                              I’ll put a 10 for now but we’ll see how it ends but just right now I’m enjoying this the most out of all the winter lineup and there’s a ton of great anime.
                              Depressed disguised magical girls doing cute things. Fast pace main characters's introduction, maybe fine not too soon, hopefully there will be more depth. 
                              So I reviewed Wonder Egg Priority last week out of pure excitement for the series, but it got taken down since episode 4 wasn't even out yet, so I figured I'd come back now to finish the job. Originally I gave the show a 10 for reasons I'll elaborate on in the review itself, but as you can see I've bumped it down to a 9.
                              It's not like I hate this series, but I just don't find the thing that make me enjoy this. This series just about someone making friends with someone that have same regrets while fighting monster. Maybe my interpretation wasn't right, but that what I feel. 
                              TLDR: Wonderful art and music, charming voice acting and characters, interesting story that's slowly opening up!
                              Beautiful visuals, tasteful subject matter, incredible animation, great voice actors, 8/10 so far
                              I want to start out by saying, that with all the absurdly popular sequels airing this season, I did not expect a new show that came from no where to be the thing I enjoyed the most, and stick with me in my mind for so long. The visuals for the show are utterly stunning--excluding the Senoevils which are the only reason I'd rate the art 9/10 for the show--and I can't stop listening to the full versions of the Opening and Ending songs.
                              First I'll say what makes the anime so good, its that its so realistic when talking about the social sense. ",210

However, some of my main gripes in relation to this series will of course be in relation to what was omitted from the manga. For example, I was upset that they took out Hayami vs Kobashi for Sanada&rsquo;s vacated jr. featherweight title, it was a fight people enjoyed and gives further character development for the winner for that fight at some capacity, and it also sets up how Ippo first meets Sanada and Dankichi, which made the build up more dramatic, while in this anime, their initial encounter is just at the weigh-in.

It was almost as great as when he won the title, in this movie you see the reason why he loves boxing and what it means to be strong, i personally liked this a lot, he defends his title and and also fights for his love, so please watch and comment on it.Now i wanna see the fight of Takamura for the world title!!! so please can we have this as a movie or a OVA!!!          
                              What makes Hajime No Ippo great are its characters. This includes Ippo's opponents. Unfortunately for this special I felt nothing for Ippo's opponent. The opponent's rationale didn't make sense. Why are you fighting? What are you trying to prove? The latter is never really fleshed out but passingly mentioned. 
                              Where should I begin, another boxing classic.
                              I have watched a lot of series all of them amazing, I'm even practically caught up in the big three but honestly no anime I have watched can top this series and I haven't even finished it yet. This is the first review I have done for an anime, no other anime has motivated me enough to actually take the time to make a review for it. though with this one I feel like I need to get the info out there. This was actually so far in my opinion the highest point of the anime. everything about this movie was just top notch and          
                              I give this special a 10 because of how the characters have built up their relations from the prequel to now.
                              This is one of the rare moments when an anime movie is satisfying. I suspect that this might be because this movie is actually canon.

                              Unfortunately this movie was a little off for me. the bulk of it was funny and enjoyable, but the fight was basically identical to the Sendo one and the opponent is a bit mono dimensional.",214
