"""In order for something to be obtained, something of equal value must be lost.""

Alchemy is bound by this Law of Equivalent Exchange—something the young brothers Edward and Alphonse Elric only realize after attempting human transmutation: the one forbidden act of alchemy. They pay a terrible price for their transgression—Edward loses his left leg, Alphonse his physical body. It is only by the desperate sacrifice of Edward's right arm that he is able to affix Alphonse's soul to a suit of armor. Devastated and alone, it is the hope that they would both eventually return to their original bodies that gives Edward the inspiration to obtain metal limbs called ""automail"" and become a state alchemist, the Fullmetal Alchemist.

Three years of searching later, the brothers seek the Philosopher's Stone, a mythical relic that allows an alchemist to overcome the Law of Equivalent Exchange. Even with military allies Colonel Roy Mustang, Lieutenant Riza Hawkeye, and Lieutenant Colonel Maes Hughes on their side, the brothers find themselves caught up in a nationwide conspiracy that leads them not only to the true nature of the elusive Philosopher's Stone, but their country's murky history as well. In between finding a serial killer and racing against time, Edward and Alphonse must ask themselves if what they are doing will make them human again... or take away their humanity.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",9.19,9,1,3,2262683,184889,"                              Adaptations have long been a thorn in the side of anime viewers, but not because they are inherently bad. No, the main problem has been that many studios have regarded the original work almost as an afterthought, and there are a number of shows that could have been wonderful if the writers had simply stuck to the original story.
                              Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood gets an immense amount of praise in the MAL community, is the #1 ranked show and is constantly referred to as a masterpiece and the greatest show ever created. I've seen many fans preach about how ""it lives up to the hype"" and ""can never receive too much praise"". Now this is just the opinion of one guy. I'm certainly not the law of the land or anything. However, I personally feel as though calling FMA:B a masterpiece and the champion of all shows is a bit of a stretch. That's not to say that I didn't enjoy it or that it          
                              Overview:
                              Since I couldn't find any legitimate objective analysis in any of these fanboy reviews, I decided put my own review: 
                              I can't even watch the original FMA anime now that I'm currently watching Brotherhood! This is a NO FILLER anime it gets straight to the point with it's beautiful animation and amazing portrayal of the manga, everything is so different! Emotions are strong and there's more of a connection between characters then in the original anime, you immediately get dragged into this show within the first 5 minuets, this is honestly one of the most spectacular anime's i've ever laid my eyes on, it's definitely one of the best new shows of the last couple years. Its a definite watch, don't miss out!          
                              Now, this is a prime example of how to adapt an manga into an anime the RIGHT way.  The original Fullmetal Alchemist, though well made and very popular, went into a downward spiral as soon as it diverted from the manga storyline and never seemed to recover.  This however, shows that instead of trying to add their own story elements when adapting manga/visual novels etc., sometimes anime producers should just sit back and retell the great story that has already been written in the original.
                              ""We're not gods, we're only human. We can't even save a little girl, so what good are we?""-Edward Elric
                              If one wishes to obtain something, something of equal value must be given, that is the law of equivalent exchange, the basis of all alchemy, the law that governs the world of Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood.

                              Why do people give this such a high rating!
                              One of my favorite anime of all time!
                              I have followed both the anime and manga of FMA for years, simultaneously. The first anime adaptation was satisfactory, but left a bad aftertaste.
                              There isn't much more I could say with all the praise it already has, but I truly believe that Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood deserves every bit of it.
                              I'm going to be completely honest here... this is my favorite anime I have ever seen. Why you ask? Simple: (besides a few irritations) there is nothing wrong with this show.
                              Ah, Fullmetal Alchemist, what an amazing ride through the world of alchemy, I'm not surprised at all it is #1 on MAL, since it also is, and probably will be, at least for a long time, #1 on my list."
"Gabi Braun and Falco Grice have been training their entire lives to inherit one of the seven titans under Marley's control and aid their nation in eradicating the Eldians on Paradis.

Having finally reached the Yeager family basement and learned about the dark history surrounding the titans, the Survey Corps has at long last found the answer they so desperately fought to uncover. With the truth now in their hands, the group set out for the world beyond the walls.

                              Shingeki no Kyojin, ''mistranslated'' as Attack on Titan, actual translation The Attack Titan. But could it mean both? Or could it hide even more meanings behind the ''Shingeki''? Shingeki no Kyojin is amazing starting from the name, and the how the meaning of  ''Shingeki no'' changes throughout the series. This has amazed me, after all never before have i seen a series with the meaning of it's name changing throughout the series.
                              Attack on Titan is probably one of the most overrated animes of all times, and to be honest, I had high expectations about this series. Before I continue, this review will cover the series from its beginning up until this point, with few minor spoilers.
                              To think that season one of Attack on Titan aired in 2013, and that I have had the pleasure of following the series since that time is something that makes me feel a great amount of pride. 
                              Oh boy, Attack On Titan is on it’s final stages. This time with a new Studio, and that Studio is MAPPA. Well let’s get straight to the review.
                              This is one of the masterpiece anime ever made, has the best storyline and the song is very epico.
                              Attack on Titan or Shingeki no Kyojin, a name which is very popular among fellow Anime watchers.

                              Shingeki is one of the many overrated shounen anime out there and I can summarize my review with one sentence: „If you became kinda interested in Shingeki , because you have heard it’s so much more than just a shounen, don’t believe it, because it is exactly that, just another shounen."" Now I’m not a fan of shounen, and if you read this review you will find out why, so this anime is not made for me, but just for more diversity in views I will analyze this anime a bit closer.
                              Well Guys this is my very first review, I wanted to start reviewing this show as soon as it comes. I'm a loyal SnK anime fan, I somehow managed to keep myself from reading the Damn Manga and avoid (maximum) spoilers. When I heared that WIT Studio is no more animating the series, I was really afraid of a sequel that's gonna end up like Nanatsu no Taizai by studio Deen, But when They announced that the final season will be released by MAPPA I was kinda relieved. Even if they changed the original character design to make it resemble more to Isayama's Artstyle.
                              Attack on titan season 4 is on its fourth episode so my opinion can change.So far I feel as if the season is following the source material the manga pretty well.It just depends how well Mappa can pull it off since the 3D titans are throwing people off.On the other hand though season 4 accelerates to a whole other level and there's a lot of new characters and good story which introuduces more understanding on titans, the rest of the world, and Erens new goal.Though it starts off with a 4 year time skip in which a lot has changed (in my opinion for the          
                              Attack On Titan is probaly one of the biggest anime out there besides Death Note or Naruto. And this season will be the end of the anime. Its sad indeed but what do I think of the first four episodes and is it still as good as the other seasons?Or better?"
"Seeking to restore humanity's diminishing hope, the Survey Corps embark on a mission to retake Wall Maria, where the battle against the merciless ""Titans"" takes the stage once again.

Returning to the tattered Shiganshina District that was once his home, Eren Yeager and the Corps find the town oddly unoccupied by Titans. Even after the outer gate is plugged, they strangely encounter no opposition. The mission progresses smoothly until Armin Arlert, highly suspicious of the enemy's absence, discovers distressing signs of a potential scheme against them. 

Shingeki no Kyojin Season 3 Part 2 follows Eren as he vows to take back everything that was once his. Alongside him, the Survey Corps strive—through countless sacrifices—to carve a path towards victory and uncover the secrets locked away in the Yeager family's basement.

                              *Minimum Spoiler Review*
                              Attack on Titan is the face of anime. It exploded onto the scene in 2013 with popularity unmatched by any other anime. No other anime has left as titanic of an impact as this one. It's the anime that introduces many newcomers into the medium. Many with no exposure to anime whatsoever have still heard of or even watched Attack on Titan. So it's only appropriate that it would be great, because that's what should be expected from what is essentially the representative of all anime. And for me, every season leading up to this one has met these high standards and been great.
                              [Spoiler Warning]
                              Season 3 Part 2 excels in presenting an engaging storyline that ties many of the mysteries of the previous seasons. It also manages to immediately grabs the viewer's attention as it displays the battle deciding humanity's fate in its full glory.
                              Attack on Titan, the franchise that made a huge impact in the anime industry once again proves itself capable of carrying the torch. Before watching this part 2, I confess that the announcement of 10 episodes was slightly worrying. I approached this season with a bit of trepidation even with some of the jaw dropping cinematic trailers. Truth to be told, Attack on Titan has a lost some hype over the years but still manages to maintain a strong fan base. It’s for that reason and its many successes that we’re getting part 2. 
                              After years and years of foreshadowing, teasing and promising great things, Attack on Titan is back and ready to reveal its mysteries. Was it worth the wait though?
                              I do not think I can ever give a 10/10 as quickly as I can for Part 2 of Season 3 of Attack on Titan. It has set the new standard for adaptations. Isayama's master storytelling, the exquisite soundtrack by Sawano, the emotional tight rope the studio had us walk throughout, the sweat-inducing action, and the perfection of the voice cast. Everything in this season has been fine tuned, and the end result is one of the greatest animated feats that I have ever had the pleasure of watching. 
                              This is the arc I think a lot of people were waiting for. The one with lots of answers. Seen folks complain for years about all the questions introduced with no immediate answers and I've seen endless memes about Eren never getting to that basement. Well we're here, we made it all the way to the sea even. But that's not enough. I think that's what Eren means at the end there, that they thought the sea would grant them freedom but in they search for freedom they only discovered that there's so much more out there. Like finally opening a door and then seeing          
                              Many people have anticipated the manga to be animated and when the wildfire spread all over the place in 2013, people were gushing over it. The popularity grew dramatically and along the way caused controversies as to whether it had become overrated. After watching the first 3 seasons, it is not. It never failed to deliver what Attack on Titan really is. So, what about this part of season 3? It still holds well. Whether you are a newcomer or a die-hard fan, you must admit that this is one of the best anime in a long time.
                              When last year Season 3 was declared to be split cour there was a considerable sadness among the fans because of the delay.But it actually came as a blessing in disguise.This season had probably the highest anticipation till now and it goes without saying there was lot of expectation and honestly WIT Studio was able to deliver it.Whether they will pick up SNK again or not is not clear at this point but this season will probably be their best work for a long time.

                              I feel bad for people who dropped this show. 
                              Don’t be so surprised when you see a whole stream of 10/10s come gushing from the reviewers who have just finished this piece of work. SnK Season 3 Part 2 is really, nothing short of breathtaking. It’s that one anime that actually makes you crave the next episode after the next, as the madman himself, Hajime Isayama leaves you awestruck with his storytelling. Why has such a typical looking shounen series risen to the 2nd place, in all of MyAnimeList? If you have not watched such a rare gem of this caliber (that may never appear in the next 5 years) yet, I suppose I          
                              A lot of bombs dropped this second half of the season. The story has finally kicked into high gear. Twists and turns and revelations seemingly dropped every episode. The plot moved beyond the threat of regular titans to the threat of the true enemy outside of the walls. We're finally starting to understand who Reiner, Bertholdt, Annie, and Zeke are. The society they belong to, where they are coming coming from, the reasons behind the attacks, and the titan origin story are some of the questions that answers were given to."
"The self-proclaimed mad scientist Rintarou Okabe rents out a room in a rickety old building in Akihabara, where he indulges himself in his hobby of inventing prospective ""future gadgets"" with fellow lab members: Mayuri Shiina, his air-headed childhood friend, and Hashida Itaru, a perverted hacker nicknamed ""Daru."" The three pass the time by tinkering with their most promising contraption yet, a machine dubbed the ""Phone Microwave,"" which performs the strange function of morphing bananas into piles of green gel.

Though miraculous in itself, the phenomenon doesn't provide anything concrete in Okabe's search for a scientific breakthrough; that is, until the lab members are spurred into action by a string of mysterious happenings before stumbling upon an unexpected success—the Phone Microwave can send emails to the past, altering the flow of history.

Adapted from the critically acclaimed visual novel by 5pb. and Nitroplus, Steins;Gate takes Okabe through the depths of scientific theory and practicality. Forced across the diverging threads of past and present, Okabe must shoulder the burdens that come with holding the key to the realm of time.

                              The subject of time travel is no stranger to the world of anime, so it takes a lot of work to make a time travel story stand out. For Steins;Gate, that hard work paid off. This is by far the best-executed time travel story that I've ever seen in my experience with anime, and if you haven't seen it yet, you're definitely missing out!
                              As you may have noticed, Steins;Gate is revered as a masterpiece by most.  For those of you who haven't had the privilege of watching this show yet, i'm writing this (belated) review to emphasize just how much you're missing out on. 
                              Just a horrible anime. This is the anime equivalent of Inception. It tries to disguise itself as being complex and cool when it's really simple and stupid.  How it managed to fool so many people into believing it is the former is beyond me.
                              One word: Hype.
                              Note that I have not read the visual novel that Steins;Gate is based on. This is a review which judges the anime adaptation by its own merits alone.
                              Steins;Gate changed my life.
                              Tutturu~! It took me awhile to finish this review, school, other online drama and whatnot. So here is my in depth evaluation/praise of the show Steins;Gate. I must say that I have excluded a lot of spoiling content so that I can have a legitimate review posted. This is my first review and I hope it informs you and gives you a different perspective of the show!
                              I Have no Idea why I am writing this review
                              Steins Gate is one of the most famous Anime of all time, especially on this website, and during the last twenty years or so that have passed, many works that do not deserve any fame or recognition have unfortunately garnered a lot of fans, and we saw a lot of these works get sanctified and venerated by others, whereas in actuality, these Anime do not deserve five minutes of your time. So, is the original Steins Gate Anime one of those Anime, or is it something that is worth your time and investment? 
                              Steins;Gate. One of the most popular visual novels of 2009. When I first heard it would get an anime adaptation, I was both psyched and worried. We all know VN to anime adaptations don’t work out that well most (read: almost ALL) of the time, and we all know that ChäoS;HEAd’s anime was absolutely terrible, especially if you compare it to the obviously superior source material, but even because of all this I was incredibly hyped for it. I had only heard great things about the VN, and I was getting my hopes up really high. 
                              Let me start with some back story and then the actual review will follow.
                              This is what should be considered as art, not what is considered as art nowadays. Sadly, nowadays among the majority of people, Anime is just considered as nonsensical and childish trash. It is drawn, so it is immature. This is what the majority thinks, and this is why it is normally difficult to find any Otaku living in near of you. It's a shame actually, that they will not experience this awesomeness, and obviously I am looking at Steins;Gate when I am saying that. Ironically, I've recently been pretty much the same, like, two or three months ago.  But I tried Anime and was          
                              An anime as dull and flat as its colour palette.  
                              I put up with this anime for so many episodes because I was told it would get better. That never happened. Really boring show. I found all the characters to be pretty mediocre and the plot moved at a snails pace. By the time the twist or the climax happened there was no enjoyment to receive for how boring the show was before. Reading other reviews I really don't see what they get in this anime, and I'm not one who typically deviates from general consensus on most anime. At least the opening for this show was really good though!          "

                              At first, when I read the synopsis of hunter x hunter (2011) (for the rest of this review will be called hxh as abbreviation) I could not quite deduce the rationality of this show being scored and reviewed with such praise as it receives on a daily basis. I am sure many of you ,who are planning to pick up this show sometime soon, are thinking the same as I did before watching this show and I will do my best to change any contravening opinions towards this series.
                              ""I see now... Yes... I see... You had me in checkmate from the start."" - Meruem 
                              HxH is one of the many overrated shounen anime out there and I can summarize my review with one sentence: „If you became kinda interested in HxH, because you have heard it’s so much more than just a shounen, don’t believe it, because it is exactly that, just another shounen."" Now I’m not a fan of shounen, and if you read this review you will find out why, so this anime is not made for me, but just for more diversity in views I will analyze this anime a bit closer.
                              After years of everyone from personal friends to random internet commentators imploring me to watch Madhouse’s 2011 adaptation of Hunter x Hunter, I finally got around to it. I was told that this was the best long-form battle shounen out there, avoiding all the sins of mediocrity other Shonen Jump titles like Naruto, One Piece, and Bleach commit. I was told Hunter x Hunter did not constantly try to implausibly escalate the stakes of each battle, didn’t rely on boring cliché motivations of characters just wanting to get stronger for no reason, did not draw out its battle sequences for outrageous lengths of time, did          
                              Heed my warning and heed it well: If you so choose to watch the gracious series that is Hunter x Hunter (2011), watch it well past the first few episodes. Though the first few episodes make the entire series as a whole seem bland, if you think this way, you're wrong and you should feel bad. Really really bad. Think of it this way: the series is a marathon runner. A good runner prepares himself and warms up for the long arduous journey ahead (ie. HxH). The bad runner carelessly takes off from the start with no preparation and eventually dying down halfway through because          
                              I often see people complain about a lack of originality when talking about anime titles without giving it proper thought. The very idea of ""being original"" is within itself a fallacy, especially when referring to any form of storytelling. Everything in one way or another draws inspiration from something else and seeking out ""original"" content shouldn't be an end goal for viewers. What one should look for is how the content itself is presented. A typical story setup is only hindered by the writer and execution of said story. Proper execution and presentation can often be what makes or breaks a show. And even a

                              So I've recently finished watching HxH after tons of recommendations from friends.
                              Story: 9.6/10
                              **This review will contain spoilers**
                              Whenever Shonen Jump releases anime based on a popular manga they are usually for the fighting and story enthusiasts. Hunter X Hunter is a show that balances the two perfectly in the form of a Yin-Yang.  Although this story is fiction, it’s still based on some part of the truth of the real world we reside in. The story is brutal, deep, emotional, breathtaking and much more! A story that is different, but yet has the same basic elements you would expect from a Shonen anime. I won’t go into details of the story or the arc because I can’t mention that without spoiling          
                              HxH has to be one of the most overrated shonen anime out there if I've ever seen it , it has the most toxic , egotistical and elitist demographic out there. The fans of this show sit on the throne they fantasise about and constantly brag about how well-written or complex this show is just to feed their inferiority complex , there are many reasons as to why I rated this show the way I did and soon you'll find out why.
                              What makes a show great? Is it the engaging story? Is it the interesting characters? Is it the immersion the show creates? I find myself always asking these questions whenever I start a series. Hunter x Hunter was no exception. I hadn't heard much when I first started it, but I had heard comparisons to Fullmetal Alchemist and Attack on Titan, both of which are some of my favorite shounens. Still, I had my doubts. ""148 episodes? How could there possibly be that much interesting plot without fillers?"" I asked. I was a fool."
"The 150-year-long stalemate between the two interstellar superpowers, the Galactic Empire and the Free Planets Alliance, comes to an end when a new generation of leaders arises: the idealistic military genius Reinhard von Lohengramm, and the FPA's reserved historian, Yang Wenli.

While Reinhard climbs the ranks of the Empire with the aid of his childhood friend, Siegfried Kircheis, he must fight not only the war, but also the remnants of the crumbling Goldenbaum Dynasty in order to free his sister from the Kaiser and unify humanity under one genuine ruler. Meanwhile, on the other side of the galaxy, Yang—a strong supporter of democratic ideals—has to stand firm in his beliefs, despite the struggles of the FPA, and show his pupil, Julian Mintz, that autocracy is not the solution.

As ideologies clash amidst the war's many casualties, the two strategic masterminds must ask themselves what the real reason behind their battle is.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",9.07,9,7,627,231540,13909,"                              This is Star Wars. Lucas's franchise should be renamed to something else.
                              Legend of the Galactic Heroes is an epic tale of the rise to power of two men born at the right time on opposite sides, leading to a clash of brilliant spectacle that could only be executed with care in as an animated original.
                              It is so rare to find any type of lengthy series that span over 100 episodes without declining in quality over its duration due to various factors such as the abundance of inconsistencies in the story, or rehashing the same narrative structural wise, which is pretty common in long running series. Other limiting factors are the available funds for its execution, or its own popularity, which can induce authors to change the course of the story. However, there is one title that managed to evade said issues, being an adaptation of a series of novels by Yoshiki Tanaka, with a lengthy production of 110 OVA          
                              History is not just the study of the past, but the events that occur throughout history hold a different meaning for different people. These past events encompass the overall thoughts, beliefs, ideas, and conceptions of all those who lived throughout it.  When a war between two different states and political ideologies breaks out with both states claiming to be fighting on the side of righteousness, which side is truly the right one?  This is the overarching theme of of the epic 110 episode OVA space opera, Legend of the Galactic Heroes. Adapted from the science fiction novel series by Yoshiki Tanaka and directed          
                              I can’t believe people has dubbed this most intellectual and complex to have come to anime. This is pretty much all talk and an unoriginal generic war story. Basically it follows two men and a guy who drinks tea on death star. These three are your typical “fight against the man because they are corrupted” characters. Of course everyone is corrupted because apparently humanity always ruins itself in the future. Humanity is split apart so our heroes must re-unite the universe, lame. If this was like 50 episodes I would probably rate this 7 and consider recommending to people.
                              Overview:
                              Legend of the Galactic Heroes feels like reading a book. 
                              Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu is a somewhat odd series, in anime terms. It began as a series of novels in the 80s, got adapted into a manga and, over the course of the late 80s to late 90s, it was turned into a 110 episode OVA. The odd part being that it was released as an OVA. For those of you who don't know, an OVA is a direct to video/ DVD release rather than one that runs on a televised network. Usually OVAs are pretty short, running somewhere from an episode to maybe a dozen. A hundred and ten episodes is virtually unheard of from          
                              Are you tired of Good Republic vs Evil Empire? Are you tired of archaic honor and pointless martyrdom? Are you tired of war dramas with runaway nationalism and selfless sacrifice to secure the government's next election victory?
                              A masterpiece! This is anime for adults. When watching it you are seeing a historical epic unfold before your eyes. It is not only one of the greatest anime series of all time, IMHO, but also one of the greatest science fiction series of all time. For both anime fans and science fiction fans it is a must see. 
                              This isn't Star Wars. George Lucas's franchise should NOT be renamed into anything else.
                              I'd like to preface this review with the fact that I'm an avid science fiction reader and have chewed through a fair amount of books in my day.  Within minutes of beginning this show you can see how derivative it is from a series of books.
                              What I have just witnessed was history unfolding before my very eyes!
                              Usually, when I have a high expectations for a show, after watching it I end up somehow disappointed. For this reason, before I watch a show I lower my expectations.
                              Legend of the Galactic Heroes is an old ass OVA series spanning 110 episodes which elitists or 'cultured' anime fans deem to be the greatest anime of all time."

                              Gintama and Godly both start with G, coincidence? This anime is the pure essence of entertainment. You will laugh, you will cry, you will become emotional invested in a variety of ways. Not having watched this anime is like missing out on a classic movie and that means that you haven't fully lived yet. I watch an episode every night before I go to sleep so that I can sleep in pure comfort and relaxation. Watching Gintama for me is not a hobby. It is a life style. I HIGHLY recommend this show to anyone who likes anime and especially comedies.          
                              Gintama'..
                              また いつか! [Mata Itsuka] [See you Again Someday!].
                              its nearly one year since the second season of Gintama has started and the loyal fans can remember the Joy and the life it gave us back then when it was aired again.the story that once was supposed to be about an school for demon dispellers and then about the Shinsengumi finally turned into something bizzare called Gintama which u can say is the Golden Work of Hideaki Sorachi.
                              GINTAMA 2012  !!!!!!! and its HD 
                              Gintama is in 16:9! Honestly, that is a genuine improvement in this season of Gintama as well as the animation. The look of this season was so much nicer than the first season, of course, since it's newer. 
                              This is my first review and i'm not really that good with writing in English. But I'll do my best.
                              My favorite Anime of all time because it has all i ever wanted.
                              There is something that nobody talks about in gintama. Even though it's one of, if not the most important detail that most people can't seem to be able to accept.
                              Gintama is the most hilarious series I’ve ever seen in my more than a decade of watching animes and reading mangas. It is number one on my top lists of best animes in comedy and in the top ten on my hundred lists of best animes in the history of anime world. So when I learned that they are coming back, I was more than delighted, I was so thankful for the whole production who decided to bring them back.
                              I've heard of this anime for a long time, but never got into it because there's so many episodes and I didn't want to start from the beginning...So I jumped into Season 6. After watching a few episodes, including the classics within Season 6, I asked myself ""What took me so long to get into Gintama!?""
                              I really like the weirdness, randomness, and epic (I would like to put ness there but there is no word epicness. Hahaha) of Hideaki Sorachi. 
                              I've seen many anime videos and movies and etc, and Gintama has to be one of those I could re-watch over and over again!
                              Gintama"
"While Gintoki Sakata was away, the Yorozuya found themselves a new leader: Kintoki, Gintoki's golden-haired doppelganger. In order to regain his former position, Gintoki will need the help of those around him, a troubling feat when no one can remember him! Between Kintoki and Gintoki, who will claim the throne as the main character?

In addition, Yorozuya make a trip back down to red-light district of Yoshiwara to aid an elderly courtesan in her search for her long-lost lover. Although the district is no longer in chains beneath the earth's surface, the trio soon learn of the tragic backstories of Yoshiwara's inhabitants that still haunt them. With flashback after flashback, this quest has Yorozuya witnessing everlasting love and protecting it as best they can with their hearts and souls.

Gintama': Enchousen includes moments of action-packed intensity along with their usual lighthearted, slapstick humor for Gintoki and his friends.

                              This might be the shortest season of Gintama but I love everything about it, from the Kintama Arc which solidified my love for both the characters and for their bond; to the courtesan of nation arc which is pumping me up for the future serious arcs and let me tell you that that arc has one of the best music, fight scene and storyline in the series; to the Beam Sword Style Arc which made me wonder if I should take it seriously or not because the whole thing is both good and farcical and of course there's Sadaharu, our gigantic and adorable dog. 
                              There are some differences between seasons of Gintama one of most important is that Gintama is getting more serious first season is more like a comedy one second and third and bit serious and like this till the end. There are lot of people who don't really like this and i will say its personal, I like where it’s going because it has potential this way too and i like that they are using it and I must also say that comedy part isn't lost its just got less. Third season consists of 12 episodes so it’s more serious than comedic, it consists of two          
                              One of the big Enchousen things is that it covers the Kintama and Courtesan of a Nation arcs, which is a turning point on the series, become more plot-oriented and entering the whole political concept of the story, since it's based on the Edo period. 
                              This season is so interesting because it's entirely filled with episodes that carry a serious tone. Gintama is always funny, but everything from the three arcs in this season to the only episodic-type episode carried emotional content. And I loved it.
                              Already wrote a review on one of the Gintama long series but I am to finish for all of the 6 Gintama on MAL just cause i'm bias AF.
                              (This review applies to the entire Gintama series.)
                              *This review is spoiler free
                              This is my first review on an anime. I'll try to write my best and try to keep it simple.
                              This was the shortest of the Gintama Arcs but it actually packs a lot in for 13 episodes. There are 3 main Arcs and few one-shot episodes. 
                              Gintama' Enchousen, one of the top anime on the list and there's only like 3 episodes out..  that says alot right there. to people who think gintama is overrated, try watching it. It's not bad, in fact its great. Give it a try, and this dipshit afdal is just bitching out because his favorite anime wasn't number one
                              Okay this is my first time writing a review. So let's give this a shot.
                              --Sorry for my English, I'm from a non-English speaking country--
                              Gintama is the most awesome anime I've ever watched, it's true that there are many great animes out there but I find them too common. Like for example, Naruto, Bleach or One piece which have almost the same plot, but I admit those three animes are good too. I'm just saying my opinion, so I think Gintama deserved to be number 1. It's almost an all in one anime. There are fights, romance, comedy and many more that you can't see in other animes. It's whole new different anime so if you haven't finished watching it yet. DON'T FRIGGIN' JUDGE. "

As he stretches to fight the leftover sluggishness of a satisfying sleep, he decides to step out on the balcony. The warm wind of a mellow morning slowly brushes past his fragile frame as if greeting him friendly. The sunshine reflects from the river just beneath the railing; a lustrous shimmer signals the change of seasons. He leaves the apartment. A lot has changed over the past year: his listless demeanor is all but gone; he has made friends and acquaintances—he isn’t alone any more. His steps have become strong and determined. He has moved on.
                              There is no anime that I am more confident in calling a masterpiece than 3-gatsu no Lion. What it is able to do is so powerful and I find it unparalleled by any other show that I have watched. Every single aspect of the show is masterful and is able to shine and enhance the show even more.
                              One year after 3-gatsu no Lion’s first season, the second one has arrived. And it manged to be even more outstanding. 
                              Ah, 3-gatsu no Lion. How I wanted to love you, and how disappointed I ultimately was. Most of the time I agree with the crowd when it comes to such things such as media review. If it’s well-received by critics, I tend to like it as well. If most people find shortcomings, most of the time I resonate with those as well. But considering I’m giving this anime a rating substantially lower than the stellar (above 9 at the time of writing) average on MAL, take this review with a grain of salt. 
                              All fart no shit.
                              I saw season one some time ago, assumed there was no second season and gave the first one 9/10. It was great.
                               The second season is so boring, it shows a lot of not usefull stuff from kawamoto family, and it gets really anoying as the anime goes. When I saw the first season, I got super interested on Kyouko, Nikaidou, Shimada and Souya, but they barely appear on the this season, instead, there are a lot of scenes of Akari cooking, I mean, not intersting at all. 
                              3-gatsu no Lion is a spectacularly popular and accredited anime that unfortunately falls short of all the hype that the series has generated. It is incredibly overrated, however it is still decent relative to the thousands of anime series out there. I know I'm going to receive a lot of flack for this review so without further ado I shall outline my arguments.
                              For people new to 3-gatsu no lion, the main problem with this series is, It doesn't have any negative reviews and it feels as if fans are only watching it. So here I am writing a genuine review for you so that you might have a better understanding of the series you are about to watch.
                              A short review for those that are new to this anime. 
                              This Contains some spoilers.
                              Sangatsu no Lion is an anime that challagens even the most boring lives in the world. An anime the vanquishes all sense of extraordinary and unique to portray the most average kind of drama someone could ever experience during adolescence.

                              3-gatsu no Lion for me has always been one of the most overlooked anime I've known."

                              [This review contains NO spoilers]
                              Overview:
                              Read All First! / SPOILERS*: (Im sorry if you don't agree, but this is my Review)
                              Everyone in the world is distinctive, each person having both positive and negative aspects about them, and every society is known for their own distinctive features. There are those who disagree with this view as nothing more than a blind and false generalization, and there are those who completely agree with it. Both ways of thinking, in my opinion, are unnecessarily exaggerated. The best solution for this is a balance, as we cannot hide one society’s trait, nor can we realistically say that a whole society belongs to a certain feature. For example, Japanese people are considered to be people who love a clean environment,          
                              This is gonna be in Spanish and in English. I'll add the translation below, explaining why I put the ""low"" rating.
                              I didn't like A Silent Voice as much as I would have liked to. The storyline had so much potential but failed to step out of boundaries. Expressing issues like suicide, mental illnesses, and bullying is a challenge through a movie, but no matter what the mediocre plot remained. I am surprised that it is rated so highly, and I think it's because of the main storyline that everyone loves it so much, but here's why I rated it so low.
                              I don't like this movie. If you do, that's great! I'm only writing this to warn people who, like me, might find this movie to be a waste of their time, and not to say anything negative about the fans of this movie.
                              some people say ""I love you"" is the hardest word to ever say to someone... but is that really true? is it that hard to say? in my case it is hard yes, but not the hardest. have you ever thought of the word ""I'm sorry""? I'm not talking of the ""easy"" ""I'm sorry"" i'm talking about the ""I'm sorry"" that comes from the bottom of your heart, the expression of your true feelings, being completely sorry, regretful, that word that burns inside you like hell... now, that's really REALLY hard to say.
                              A Silent Voice is a beautiful looking filmーlike most of Kyoto Animation’s productions. The artistic direction was on point, but that aspect of this creation doesn’t make up for the poorly constructed story. The story is about a bully making amends for beating and antagonizing a deaf girl as a child. 
                              I was lucky enough to catch the very first screening of Koe no Katachi in Singapore's cinemas on March 9, 2017. This is also my first review, so please bear with me if my review layout is not great.
                              Like any other slice-of-life anime, the plot is relatively simple, however there is an outstanding attention to the development of the characters."
"After joining the resistance against the bakufu, Gintoki and the gang are in hiding, along with Katsura and his Joui rebels. The Yorozuya is soon approached by Nobume Imai and two members of the Kiheitai, who explain that the Harusame pirates have turned against 7th Division Captain Kamui and their former ally Takasugi. The Kiheitai present Gintoki with a job: find Takasugi, who has been missing since his ship was ambushed in a Harusame raid. Nobume also makes a stunning revelation regarding the Tendoushuu, a secret organization pulling the strings of numerous factions, and their leader Utsuro, the shadowy figure with an uncanny resemblance to Gintoki's former teacher.

Hitching a ride on Sakamoto's space ship, the Yorozuya and Katsura set out for Rakuyou, Kagura's home planet, where the various factions have gathered and tensions are brewing. Long-held grudges, political infighting, and the Tendoushuu's sinister overarching plan finally culminate into a massive, decisive battle on Rakuyou.

When we talk about Gintama we mostly talk about its gag part but what I like more are the story like arcs with humor and not all gag arc which seems like a filler. This season focused on that very aspect. This season of Gintama has a nice story line with each episode explaining many plot holes like why people call Katsura zura (No it is not some plain nickname, it has meaning behind it), why did Yoshida Shouyo suddenly become his beloved students enemy and it          
                              Gintama is slowly coming to its end, sadly it isn't ending on a high note. With this season of Gintama the focus of the anime is moving towards ending its overarching story line which means each episode is more serious and focused on the action and backstory over what is in my opinion Gintama's biggest strength in the first place, Comedy.
                              When you think of Gintama, you think of its comedy and what it's known for. As like its previous season, Gintama has started to throw most of the comedy out the window in order to finish the story and thus its franchise as a whole. However, doing this is not a good thing, and in this season it is quite apparent. When you compare this to the previous one—while only being 12 episodes to 51—the dip in quality is really apparent. Would it have been better if it was more than 12 episodes? Yes, and maybe not. It would have had more time to bring

                              Can someone fill me in on why this season is boring to some people? Is it because it's a main story arc and there's no traditional, Gintama comedy? Does that make people butthurt? I thought this season was phenomenal. It took insane strides in character development and story development, and all of it was interesting to watch.

                              Gintama review 
                              Having now watched the main tv seasons of Gintama where do I rate this one...
                              While others argue this season is one of the worser ones of the Gintama seasons, I disagree. The only thing I can agree with, is that the art of the new season isn't as a good as in previous ones but that alone isn't enough to make it go down to a lower score. Another reason others say this season was a dip in quality was due to the lack of comedy, thus ""losing its franchise as a whole"" but that's bullshit. Although yes, Gintama is definitely a comedy series and generally doesn't have so many serious arc in a row, doesn't mean that this          
                              So we got 12 linear episodes of gintama, were they good or not, we'll see.
                              They made this season way too short. 12 episodes is nothing to what fans are used to. We want 30-50 episode seasons with fillers and lots of laughs - not just the cliche main story arc we all knew was coming with a joke thrown in here and there. Overall this season was way too short and way too serious. If nothing else is clear about this last season it is that we are approaching the end of another great anime and they no longer have the time or no longer want to take the time to make it as fun as it was in          
                              Are you kidding me? I think, this season is the most epic season in anime history. I love to see gintoki in battle scenes and action. yes, gintama may be a comedy-themed anime, but isn't it great to watch the stories of the characters? and they only did this in 12 episodes. Didn't all those fight scenes, sensuality and everything in 12 episodes make the anime even more spectacular? I'm sure if Gintama had been such an anime from the beginning, it would have been the number one in action anime. sorachi wants to tell us with this series ""I can write a story like          
                              I have to say that this is my first time walking away from a Gintama season not completely blown away by it.  In fact, I would say that this was the weakest Gintama season of them all.  But, because its Gintama, even though it was weak for its own standard, it still made for an entertaining anime.   
                              (This review applies to the entire Gintama series.)
                              This was a deception for me, Gintama is my favorite anime and even if this season was not ""bad"" it was bad in comparison to the other seasons."

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.96,8,13,84,919514,62347,"                              Recently I had the absolute pleasure of watching Clannad: After Story.  I had previously seen the original Clannad and liked it as a light-hearted slice of life anime, good but not amazing.  I went into After Story expecting the same thing, but what I got was something fantastically different.
                              Emotions are a powerful thing; they have the capability to override any modicum of rationality and force even the ficklest of beings to succumb to their emotional disposition. Due to this, often times, those of us who claim ourselves to be critics of various mediums fall short of our own expectations. “Clannad After Story”, a series described as “life-changing” by many is the perfect suspect; a production that captured the hearts of the majority that viewed it while instantly becoming a classic within its genre. Littered with subpar designed moe characters, irrelevant arcs, contradictory elements, forced plot devices, and a plethora of other obvious issues,          
                              *Yet another successful heart warming series produced by Kyoto Animation that surpasses its predecessor.*
                              The original series, the highly rated ""Clannad"", was one painful viewing experience for me - not because it's full of tragic tales, but because of how dire it is. Female characters sugary enough to induce diabetes in a lump of rock, combined with atrociously forced ""drama"" fast tracked it to a lofty position on my ""Overrated Shite"" list. And yet its ratings pales in comparison to that of its sequel, ""Clannad: After Story"".
                              ""Do you like this school? I really, really love it. But nothing can stay unchanged. Fun things... Happy things... They can't all possibly stay unchanged. Even so, can you keep on loving this place?"" 
                              After watching many anime and reading many manga, I would recommend Clannad AS to most people just as strongly as when I first finished it. (I cry to it just as much too.) What sets After Story apart for me is the encompassing world it develops in addition to the main story. The completeness of the narrative is beautiful and rare, since many other media products of our time give up on telling a complete story for a variety of reasons. A plethora of stories are all told at once for the imaginative viewer who appreciates all of the series' nuances. Without spoilers, by the          
                              **SPOILER FREE REVIEW**
                              To be frank, I despised the first season with a passion. For the life of me I couldn’t understand what was so great about it. Yet I still saw the fandom of Clannad everywhere; from the forums to it being favourited on every other profile. I promised to stay away from ~After Story~ after witnessing the fail or rather mediocrity of Clannad. However, seeing the rage of it rising faster and louder with it being currently ranked #1 on the site I caved. Like a kid being peer pressured into smoking I reluctantly watched it. And I’m glad I did. 
                              If a work of fiction drags its audience into the depths of hell with tragedy, does it retain its artistic merit if the entire experience is nullified by the conclusion?
                              ~After Story~ is an anime that touches people's souls. I watched it, and was blown away. This was just less than a year ago.
                              Clannad caught me off guard last year being incredibly different from its predecessors, Air and Kanon 2006. There wasn't so much focus on a story as there was just following the school life of main characters Nagisa and Tomoya, as well as all their friends. When Clannad ended, Clannad After Story was announced. After Story not only guarantees its like its predecessors, but does so in a way that almost makes it excessive and, in the end, shameful. Though this may be the case, After Story is still a superior follow-up to the first season, following a more structured storyline, deepening characters, and still portraying          
                              Clannad ~After Story~ Review
                              Magical, one of a kind beauty, executed and told in the most emotional way. Extremely unique and fascinating character development lead through life with its ups and downs. Realistic and tragic tale of love, life and living. A story which has lot to say and even more to offer. Life goes on, people change, but some things always stay the same. Or.. do they?
                              So it has finally come to this. As I'd watched this anime I felt compelled to review it, heck I've done it in my head many times over. Every time I had a new thought, realization that made it greater in my mind. The reason for doing this is most likely that Clannad succeeded in amplifying every single story arc, making it feel grand, perfect and complete. It was around halfway into After Story that I'd realized I am in way over my head. This does not deserve to be dissected and reviewed like some faulty piece of garbage. No sir.

"The Amanto, aliens from outer space, have invaded Earth and taken over feudal Japan. As a result, a prohibition on swords has been established, and the samurai of Japan are treated with disregard as a consequence.

However one man, Gintoki Sakata, still possesses the heart of the samurai, although from his love of sweets and work as a yorozuya, one might not expect it. Accompanying him in his jack-of-all-trades line of work are Shinpachi Shimura, a boy with glasses and a strong heart, Kagura with her umbrella and seemingly bottomless stomach, as well as Sadaharu, their oversized pet dog. Of course, these odd jobs are not always simple, as they frequently have run-ins with the police, ragtag rebels, and assassins, oftentimes leading to humorous but unfortunate consequences.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.96,8,14,115,762411,48648,"                              Gintama? Gintama. Hmmm, Gintama... Gintama or not Gintama, that is the question.
                              Gintama is an ongoing manga by Sorachi Hideaki. From 2006 to 2010, Sunrise, the same studio behind the Gundam franchise, did an anime adaptation which lasted for just over 200 episodes. So, does the anime manage to stay entertaining for that long, or even be entertaining at all? Let’s take a peek and find out.
                              Gintama is a masterclass in comedy writing and variety; a series that grows in originality with each passing episode, so inventive and fresh, dynamic and interesting, it's no wonder it has become one of Sunrises' flagship series, not to mention a mainstay of Shounen Jump.
                              Gintama is a very inconsistent and overrated series. 
                              It’s always baffled me how Gintama fans think a series with pretty much 80% filler and 20% story is a “masterpiece” and the “best anime ever!!1!”
                              Gintama to be symbolized is like a bottle of fine apple cider. Its not the hot cinnamon one you enjoy at  winter time, but a bubbly and sweet drink enjoyed alongside some of the finest of your holiday wines.  Gintama is sweet. With a cast of bubbling and energetic characters who lift spirits. They just make the show sizzle with satisfying pops. At first Gintama feels like a kiddy drink laughable and nothing more. As you slow down and enjoy Gintama it becomes something more.  There is certain tartness mixed in, a hint of something more dramatic, this only materializes itself once          
                              At first I was very skeptical towards the idea of watching this anime. For you see, to watch Gintama one must have a profound knowledge on Japanese pop-culture and language (as the show doesn't lack puns and references), none of which I have. Nevertheless, if you are one to appreciate a good laugh and a chaotic story line, Gintama is the anime for you.
                              I've never really been a fan of long-running shounen anime. I had some bad run-ins with series like Naruto and Bleach when I was a kid and ever since then I've tried my best to stay away from them. For the same reason, I'm quite sure I would never have made myself watch Gintama either if it wasn't for its incredibly high ratings which made me feel somewhat obligated to. When I eventually started it though about 1,5 years ago, it was very quickly made evident that Gintama is... different. Not just different from other shounen anime, but different from almost every anime. In many          
                              Before I write this review which is very long overdue I would like to first establish that Gintama is my favourite series in both the manga and anime mediums and it is something that I will carry with me forever, it took me out of a very dark part in my life and set me on the right path. Gintama is something that becomes better as time moves on and you learn more about Japanese culture (of course, manga and anime) looking back at the series but it is also a very compelling story with slowly arching storyline with some really emotional moments and just          
                              (Note: At the moment I am reviewing this I have completed every single seasons of Gintama so I am reviewing the Gintama as a whole series not just Season 1.)
                              My first review ever, and unfortunately a negative one, but i'll do my best to explain why i'm giving it such a score.
                              Comedy that never once fails to make us laugh
                              Gintama has become somewhat of a favourite amongst many in the anime community, as evident to anyone who views the Top Anime on MAL. However, does popularity directly correlate to quality? With a 5/10 rating, it's obvious my answer is no, but why exactly is that?
                              Comedy is a genre which can be very difficult to appeal to the majority of people, as it is heavily dependent on ones preferences, as well as his own past experiences with the medium. Besides these limitations, there is an other factor that plays a role, which are the cultural differences that exist in current society, as a lot of comedy is dependent on the understanding of said cultural customs. This is done in the West through various types, such as satires, sitcoms, cringe comedies or slapstick comedies; in the East, particularly Japan, this done through the most known type of comedy, the Manzai, or

"When Gintoki apprehends a movie pirate at a premiere, he checks the camera's footage and finds himself transported to a bleak, post-apocalyptic version of Edo, where a mysterious epidemic called the ""White Plague"" has ravished the world's population. It turns out that the movie pirate wasn't a pirate after all—it was an android time machine, and Gintoki has been hurtled five years into the future! Shinpachi and Kagura, his Yorozuya cohorts, have had a falling out and are now battle-hardened solo vigilantes and he himself has been missing for years, disappearing without a trace after scribbling a strange message in his journal.

Setting out in the disguise given to him by the android time machine, Gintoki haphazardly reunites the Yorozuya team to investigate the White Plague, and soon discovers that the key to saving the future lies in the darkness of his own past. Determined to confront a powerful foe, he makes an important discovery—with a ragtag band of friends and allies at his side, he doesn't have to fight alone.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.96,8,15,876,172033,2204,"                              With this movie, Gintama has reached even greater heights. Compared to the previous movie, Gintama: The Final Chapter - Be Forever Yorozuya isn't a retelling of an arc, but a story of Gin's past. Many fans throughout the Gintama franchise have always wanted an arc focusing about Gin's past during the Joui War, and now we get it. As a Gintama fan, you will definitely want to watch this movie about his past and how he tries to cope about what is to come of him. 
                              The new Gintama movie is a side story that delivers some laughs and new character designs, but is totally convoluted. Asking Gintama to make sense is kind of a faux-pas. It's demented on purpose. But what starts off as an absurdist comedy quickly devolves into boring shounen fan pandering. The movie follows 265 episodes, a recap film, plus a series of practically unrelated OVAs. In conclusion it is a minor entry in the series overall, but is certainly not worth missing for any Gintama fan.
                              I laughed, I cried, I felt. I cursed myself for not viewing it sooner. Be Forever Yorozuya encapsulates everything that makes Gintama in a two hour, finely wrapped package. If the tv series weren’t returning as of next year, I could think of no better way to send off the series.   
                              Easy to understand Gintama review:
                              Ok I will have to be honest, I am a new comer to the Gintama series and I heard it was fantastic and I was excited to watch it. I do not know all of the characters personally well but I invited my friends to watch it with me who were also new and OH BOY OK NOW TO GET TO THE REVIEW. ( I would like to point my knowledge of the series first)
                              I found this movie extremely enjoyable, from the start all the way until the end, it was hilarious! 
                              Being a fan of Gintama, I really looked forward to this movie. I was not really let down, but maybe that was because I already knew what was coming.
                              As if the anime wasn't incredibly good already...I really think this second film really tops both the series and the previous movie. It had all the elements of what makes the show so good including a wacky intro making it classic Gintama from the get-go.
                              Well to start off it should come by no surprise that i feel that this moive is awesome by my score.
                              *This review contains no spoiler*
                              ""THIS MOVIE IS BAD""... if there's someone who said something like that i dont know their reaction about other anime movie then ( or maybe they were drunk when they said that )
                              Advice: don't skip the beginning even though it seems like an ad
                              Gintama: Kanketsu-hen - Yorozuya yo Eien Nare, or Gintama: The Final Chapter - Be Forever Yorozuya, is the second film in the Gintama franchise, written by the author of Gintama,  Hideaki Sorachi. Written as a possible end to the anime, this film brings Gintama into darker and more dramatic territory, more so then ever before, whilst still balancing the film with the humour that made the series so popular. All this, and more, is all blended together to create one of the best anime films created in modern days.
                              I was a little worried at first because I hadn't watched gintama in a while and I thought that I was holding expectations that were too high, but of course, the movie reminded me that gintama will never disappoint. 
                              I remember all the laughs I had watching Gintama. I was so excited for this movie and it had been lost in my memories until now after waiting for English subtitles. I was right to be excited for this movie because it was... absolutely amazing. Many things in the movie might seem plain like the plot but the creators of the movie have dug deeper and expressed them more thoroughly which can get to the reader even more than a regular scene. The classic jokes of Gintama never fail and the transitions between serious and humor are great too. If you don't watch Gintama, I          "

                              Fair warning: this review contains MAJOR spoilers of basically the entire movie. First off, it's a movie that has taken people by storm, so I'm sure that if you want to watch it, you already have by now. If that's not the case, I recommend you exit off of this review immediately. You've been warned.
                              Before watching this movie, I must say I was pretty hyped as lots of my friends recommended it and it took the #1 spot on MAL. However, I have to admit I am quite disappointed in the end and here's why:
                              	Ever since I was a child, I wanted to be an author. I’d write for days on end, using every ounce of my imagination, and then stored my works away in some secret drawer when I finished. Frightened to death of sneers and condescending laughter, I rarely shared my writings with anyone, only submitting them to a contest or two over the years. A couple of months ago, I heard that there was going to be a prestigious writer’s conference, known as Books Alive, in my town, where literary agents would search high and low for the next great author. Despite having a small amount          
                              With ""Your Name"" storming up to MAL's top, I had to check it out for myself and experience this phenomenon, that has a score of 9,40 out of 10 at the time of writing. 
                               Makoto Shinkai never fails to frustrate me. His works have tremendous potential, yet they all inevitably end up as shallow exercises in romantic drama that are pretty to look at and not much else. With the release of Kimi no Na wa. I was very skeptical if any of that had changed. It released to the top of multiple anime lists seemingly over night and I figured it would be 5 Centimeters Per Second 2.0, but maybe, just maybe, Shinkai would break away from his old patterns and surprise me.

                              Before the review this is my personal opinion: I am so glad that this series didn’t disappoint me at all and I had such a great time watching it . Monogatari will always be one of the best anime I saw and I genuinely love it with all  my heart starting with the great characters and ending with the lessons told from each series. 
                              [9.0/10]
                              **THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS**
                              ***This is a spoiler free review***
                              As I've seen every part of this series in this year, I can say this story gives the tip of the iceberg. It concludes the main arc it had, not only flawlessy, but add something on top of it. I rarely purchase the source material for an anime, but clearly, I will purchase the entire series. I am suggesting anyone, who is just astound how this 2nd season has an high ranking, just to watch the entire series in release order.
                              Like everyone who has watched Monogatari to this point, I'm obviously a huge fan of the show, which is why it pains me to say this, but: Owarimonogatari 2nd Season is overrated.  Honestly, several parts of the Monogatarai series are better than this, including the first season.  And while it was an enjoyable entry, I kind of expected more, considering this is the highest ranked of all the Monogatari series.  But, in truth, this turned into one massive cop out after another.  
                              After a few months of watching Monogatari, I finally came to the second season of Owarimonogatari. And what an experience it was. There was everything I loved about this series, complex story, great music and characters and extensive but interesting dialogues. The only problem for some people can be the pace at which first episodes go, so it might be a problem for some people, at least at the beginning I think.
                              Originally I was only planning to watch Bakemonogatari because it was recommended to me saying it is like Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai. I did not expect after a few months I would watch the whole series and finally reach this point that I am just in awe of the trip I have taken. 
                              Owarimonogatari 2nd Season is one of those animes that have everything you will like.
                              (Before reading the review, or planning on watching this anime. Please do realize that this arc marked the end of the journey of Araragi's confrontations of the supernatural, amidst his occupation as a high schooler, before being graduated from being a high schooler to a college student. That being said, it's unwise and rather illogical to not watch this at the very end of the timeline, which can be discerned here (http://imgur.com/UjlhSyS). But that being said, you must watch all aired series of monogatari, excluding hanamonogatari ofc, since it's entirely irrelevant to the main story or the main attention of the plot of Koyomi, the          
                              Owarimonogatari’s Second Season is essentially the climax of the series, or at least one of them. We finally get to see others take care of Araragi in the same manner he takes care of others. Owarimonogatari II features and resolves Araragi’s Ghost Stories in a similar fashion it has featured and resolved every other character’s. 
                              Look, if youv'e gotten this far in the series, you're not gonna be reading reviews to check if you should finish. This review is for people who are wondering if this is a series that will be worth investing in, or for those who just finished the first one or two series and are thinking ""...is this worth it?""

                              Owarimonogatar Season 2 clearly solved all the problems and questions we always had throughout the series. We could say this is the end(but not technically). I really enjoyed watching this and was totally immersed during the whole 3 episodes. Not to mention in light novel as well."
"One year has passed since the Black Rebellion, a failed uprising against the Holy Britannian Empire led by the masked vigilante Zero, who is now missing. At a loss without their revolutionary leader, Area 11's resistance group—the Black Knights—find themselves too powerless to combat the brutality inflicted upon the Elevens by Britannia, which has increased significantly in order to crush any hope of a future revolt. 

Lelouch Lamperouge, having lost all memory of his double life, is living peacefully alongside his friends as a high school student at Ashford Academy. His former partner C.C., unable to accept this turn of events, takes it upon herself to remind him of his past purpose, hoping that the mastermind Zero will rise once again to finish what he started, in this thrilling conclusion to the series.

",8.91,8,18,36,1279013,64955,"                              Code Geass is the dumbest show to ever take itself seriously. It is essentially a hackneyed amalgamation of clichés and overused plot devices that clumsily attempts to disguise itself as something greater. Hell, it stole Death Note’s whole shtick, and ruined it completely, before the anime version even finished airing. It blatantly stole from Evangelion, the most popular mecha anime and deconstruction there is, to make one of the weakest and most cliché mecha series ever. Both of the series Code Geass stole from were dark and had at least some depth; Code Geass, on the other hand, juxtaposes pseudo-dark scenes with light school-life harem          
                              Put on your seatbelts and brace yourself, for you will be taken on a rabidly-paced and concluding journey, slaloming through plot twists and character development at a tempo that will leave you longing for a new episode at the end of each one. Save a lot of time, for this is obnoxiously addictive. This is... Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch... R2!
                              *A great sequel to Code Geass, but not quite a masterpiece.*
                              On the surface, this looked great - promising setting, themes, characters, world. Unfortunately, all things that were clever about Season 1 were scrapped in favor of... well, I don't know, really. Shocking the audience? Misplaced fanservice?
                              Code Geass R2 is, in essence, the most resounding travesty in the history of Japanese animation, and proof that anime fans will watch anything if it panders to them enough. It is to anime what Heroes is to US television, except that when Heroes became terrible midway through the viewers abandoned the series. This monstrosity only got more popular in the same situation. It's truly baffling.
                              Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion Review:
                              I'm going to write a review about R2 that may not be well liked among Geass fans, for the low score I give it, but I ask the reader to hear me out and read this in an impartial light. 
                              Code Geass R2 has provoked conflicting reactions among the fan base, just like the original series did. Viewers still loved or hated it outright, even as many others laughed, and once again it's not hard to see why.
                              The sequel outdoes the original!
                              I've been trying to review this series since it ended, but it's proven difficult because while I want to treat it as impartially as possible, there are a lot of factors that went into the decision-making of the series that make it hard to judge in just one way. I'm sure that that's true for a lot of series, but it's simply that I've been made all too aware about everything that had to do with this one. Being a huge fan of the first season doesn't help either.
                              Well, I'm not going to be very positive about Code Geass R2. Since the first season was actually pretty good, I started to watch CG R2 in the hope that R2 would be just as great. 
                              NaNoWriMo is an annual event in which the goal is to write a novel in 30 days. Anyone can do it, but in order to reach your goal, you often sacrifice editing, plotting a narrative, and forgetting certain character developments you meant to make. The reason I say this is because Code Geass R2 is an exact reflection of the NaNoWriMo story down to the last detail.
                              After a hugely successful season 1, we have the highly anticipated sequel, Code Geass R2.
                              Generally I review only the anime that haven't been reviewed but Code Geass R2 affected me so much I had to write a review. RL Context: Work and other RL obligations had kept me from anime for a while. Coming back to anime and starting with .Hack/Sign wasn't the smartest thing to do. Thank god the next anime I saw was this one, or I would probably have gone on another anime hiatus.

[Written by MAL Rewrite] ",8.87,8,19,122,736067,12958,"                              Like many other people, I initially wasn't attracted to Haikyuu. Seeing clips and hearing about anime such as Free made me think that Haikyuu too would be another fanservice sports anime. I was surprised, however, to find that I immensely enjoyed Haikyuu. Haikyuu is by no means my favorite anime, but it is the anime that I have become the most attached to.
                              Given the monumental amount of hype that Haikyuu seems to have within its own fan base, I hope that this review will not come across as more negative than I intended it to, so I would just like to start by saying that Haikyuu is for sure one of the better traditional sports anime I have seen, but even so it is still far from perfect.
                              “You are only an amazing ace if you can create a miracle.” 
                              The match point is finally here. You’re the one to take the first step in securing the final point. You start your way to behind the serving line. Your whole body is warmed up, but somehow your hands are still ice-cold, initiated by the sheer thought of failing in this crucial moment. The pressure is immense, yet you still don’t waste a thought on not giving your all. If you make that one more point you’ll win the match. Just one more point and all your hard work will be rewarded. Amidst that thought, you toss the ball in the air and set off for          
                              (Review got removed because it was updated to completion ;-; gotta make the climb back)
                              I take it back, I take it all back. I originally wrote a review during the season where I was of the opinion that this season was lacking compared to the first two. Still good, but not as great story wise. Well I just watched the final episode and hours later I'm still an emotional wreck.
                              Story: In this third installment of Haikyuu, the anime continues to follow the events of the manga with no significant changes. This season centers on the finals arc against Shiratorizawa, a powerhouse school known for its tall, strong, and talented players and has consistently represented the Miyagi prefecture in the National Spring Tournament.
                              Lord... since its premiere I must have watched and re-watched this season's Haikyuu!! for 20 times now and I am always mesmerized-- not only by its magnificence, but also by its timelessness.
                              Only a word for descript this Third season; Tsukishima!!! 
                              This season of Haikyuu was consistent in terms of the qualities Haikyuu has presented so far.
                              This anime will get you pumped .... Idk why people rate it with 6/7 ....
                              I'm not a big fan of sports anime.. At least it was what i thought. I was really skeptical when i began to see Haikyuu, but now, i'm very glad i watched it. It's like if a hidden passion for sports anime has awakened inside me, and Haikyuu is in the top of it. I don't know if this third season is the best; it's actually hard to choose just one season; to me, each one of them has its qualities, and they're equally outstanding.
                              Haikyuu!! Season 3
                              If your looking for a sports anime with character development this is the place! you can see the personal struggle each character is having and want to root for them when they do good and feel bad for the when they do bad. This show puts you behind the eyes of each character and being able to witness the struggles they face when up against a powerful foe. The conflict between characters is displayed beautifully and the way they battle it out is shown like no other. For both sides of the net you can feel the drive these characters have. In the end its          
                              This is my first review so i would like to start by saying that normally i dont write reviews no matter how great the anime but this anime really drew me in. This anime is probably one of the best if not the best sports anime i have ever seen the story was superb as if you see making a 10 episode anime of a single match is simply extraordinary. "

                              (Sigh)
                              Given that this season feels like it was split in half by the story, I'm gonna go at this that way because, otherwise, I won't have anything to say.
                              This review covers the Gintama series as a whole. 
                              This season had a lot going for it. It immediately fixed the pacing issues of the season before it, it put its budget on display immediately, and even though the story shift halfway through sounds strange in concept, it really worked, and looked like it was going places. The emotionally charged opening had one of the best songs in the entire series, and effectively used the massive cast to its advantage.
                              First things first. My ""reviews"" system is explained on a blog entry. Which can be found through my profile.

                              After all the episodes of Gintama i watched until now, this anime made me laugh a lot, sadly cant believe this best comedy anime is coming to end, when i first watch this anime, i thought it was something else, but when starting watching more and more episodes of it, it made me feel awesome!"
New Gintama movie.,8.85,8,21,2933,31014,908,"                              Listen up! Let’s say you drink too much strawberry milk, and have to use the bathroom in the middle of the night, but it’s cold outside your bed. You don’t want to get up, but the urge to urinate is just too strong! You make up your mind to go! You run to the bathroom, stand in front of the toilet, and let loose! You think that all your life has led to this moment! But then you realize. It isn’t the bathroom! You’re still in bed! That feeling of lukewarm wetness spreads like wildfire! But you don’t stop! You can’t stop! That’s what I’m          
                              This movie has everything that makes a classic Gintama: parody, toilet humor, drama, sword action, tears and blood, top notch DOES song, self deprecating humor and jokes that piss off Japan’s PTA.

                              Greatest of all time. Zenith of the medium. Hallmark of media. Gold standard of storytelling. Apogee of creativity. Vertex of invention. Crest of ingenuity. Acme of imagination. Pinnacle of innovation. Epic of epics. MASTERPIECE OF THE MASTERPIECE. Legend among legends. Peak fiction
                              Gintama finally making it's final chapter after so many fakes in theatres. This movie really was the ending the entire series deserved. It covers the final manga chapters and the story outlives the ending of the Silver Soul Arc. The story ended as it should be, the whole series had the over all goal for the characters to live their daily lives having fun jokes and gags as going on adventures together, as their pasts come to haunt them sometimes even literally. In one finale all the lovable characters come back once again to take down the one last obstacle from them living their lives.          
                              Gintama never fail to surprise the fans, it will always have a special place in our hearts."

He and his mentor Reigen Arataka continue to deal with supernatural requests from clients, whether it be exorcizing evil spirits or tackling urban legends that haunt the citizens.

While the workflow remains the same, Mob isn't just blindly following Reigen around anymore. With all his experiences as a ridiculously strong psychic, Mob's supernatural adventures now have more weight to them. Things take on a serious and darker tone as the dangers Mob and Reigen face are much more tangible and unsettling than ever before.

                              What makes a show good? Is it the story’s ability of positing a revolutionary concept or to delve into deep unprecedented philosophical topics and tackle uncharted themes and ideas? Or, maybe it’s the unique characters present that imbue the show with relatability and separate it from the rest? This season of Mob Psycho 100 has me thinking otherwise. Mob Psycho takes themes like self-identity, comradery, uniqueness and blends them into a tale that I will not soon forget. Mob Psycho tackles the aforementioned themes in a way that most of its predecessors have failed to do. This has me believing that in order to fabricate          
                              A heart.
                              Sometimes, I wish I could wipe my own memory and relive the experience of something all over again. Whether it’s a book, manga, video game, TV show, or anime, there’s probably one thing out there we all want to experience all over again for the first time. Mob Psycho 100 Season 2 is one of those things. 
                              Mob Psycho 100 II follows in the footsteps of its antecedent in having terrible comedy, uninteresting battles, and fatuous characters.  Mob-kun is essentially a younger, non-bald version of Saitama with none of the “charming” qualities that would allow the viewer to become engrossed with his various escapades.  Situational comedy typically originates from Mob’s lack of self-awareness, in conjunction with the manipulative nature of the self-proclaimed “Greatest Psychic of the 21st Century” (i.e. Arataka Reigen) who frequently employs “special moves” that are intended to be hilarious, but, more often than not, are puerile absurdities that involve copious amounts of — hypertension-inducing — sodium chloride.          
                              SPOILERS BELOW
                              It rarely happens that second season of any anime tops the first season but its not the case with the Mob Psycho 100, because its clearly improves over 1st season artistically and story-wise too. 
                              It's taken quite a while to sit down and write my thoughts on Mob Psycho 100 II. For the longest time, I've been trapped in this limbo of not wanting to write but never finding anything remotely close to my perspective being represented. It's as if no one has any of the same problems I have with this season, therefore I’ve yet to find someone disappointed in it for any of the same reasons as me. As such, this review is born more out of a place to satisfy myself and bring peace to my perspective than anything I’ve written thus far. Keeping a measured          
                              Like you, I was waiting for the unknown entity seen in the ""????!!!%"" state in Season 1 to somehow be expatiated upon and it wasn't. This season was incredibly unsatisfying and lost it's reputation of breaking tropes and instead made the decision to follow every single Shounen trope. No ground breaking themes or events in this season, sadly.
                              If you are coming back to the second of Mob Psycho to once again experience the series, then I do have great news for you. It's maintained the level of quality it has presented in Season 1 and it has continued to develop on the themes it has been presenting so far. If you were satisfied in the past by Mob Psycho, it is very unlikely that this season of Mob Psycho is gonna be any different. If you're on the opposite side of the spectrum, I haven't seen Mob Psycho change its approach in any way that would cause someone to consider the series          
                              If you thought Mob Season 1 was a 10/10 like I did, prepare to view a 20/10. Everything about this season dwarfs the original season. Everything that was good in it has been multiplied to an insane level I never thought was possible. The Art and Animation reach new peaks, the soundtrack and overall sound design totally immerse and treat the ear to a delightful, emotion-evoking experience. The story continues with similar and entirely new themes in an insanely powerful way. The characters continue to evolve and grow while still retaining what we all loved about them. It's truly one of the best anime, or          
                              Ok, so I'm pretty sure I'm in the minority here so before I start this review let me just say that I very much enjoyed the second season of MP II. I rate a 7 due to the fact that it was not as interesting compared to the first season. More specifically, it had a certain charm that stems a lot from the dynamic between Reagan and Mob. Where the first season had an extremely good flow to it, most of the story this season feels more episodic. 
                              As is the case with sequels of critically-acclaimed and popular anime, Mob Psycho's second season was among the most anticipated anime of 2019, with lots of hype being built even before it aired. Many claim that the second managed to actually surpass the first one by leagues, praising the character development and the plot's shift to more dramatic and slice-of-life elements.
                              A few years prior to the 2nd season of Mob Psycho 100, this series was relatively unknown. One Punch Man - once a goofy webcomic drawn in the charmingly childish style of ONE - was masterfully redrawn by the accomplished mangaka Yusuke Murata, and not long after an explosive anime adaptation from Madhouse introduced the world to the works of ONE.

                              I had the opportunity to view this film in theaters. This film exceeded my expectations. The previous 2 films were, unfortunately, unable to stand alone. Out of the two, this was the most action-packed and climactic. I was continuously blown away by the excellent sound direction and animation. Like most Shaft anime, the last Kizumonogatari film has an avant garde method of storytelling. It might seem strange, but it works for the tone and comedy of the anime. Random clips pop out and sometimes seem disjointed, however they only add to the amazing animation. There was one scene in particular that had everyone in the

                              Kizumono 3 answered questions that surfaced in the first and second installments. It also lessened my disdain for some of the objectives that were displayed in the previous films, particularly in regard to Guillotinecutter and his crew. After one last major surprise, Kiss Shot is returned to her final form. Her attitude has reverted to that of her 8-10 year old incarnation in the first film; cheerful, carefree and seemingly generous. Of course, her impression will appear differently to others. this is only my opinion and I admit, I didn't care for her person in Nekketsu. Araragis growth as a vampire and as a young          
                              Note: my native language isn't English. Sorry for any grammar/spelling mistakes.
                              I'm just gonna review all three Kizu movies here if you don't mind.
                              While Part II showed the descent of Araragi into a vampire, Part III showed the descent of Araragi as a character. He oscillates between the comfort of being led and self pity without remorse. After frolicking about with the vampire in an extended montage, Araragi realizes that his rescue would be responsible for human deaths when she feeds, then resolves to commit suicide to make up for... absolutely nothing but self-satisfaction. Rather, he conflates his humanity (e.g. ethics) for his human life, thinking that somehow the utility scales would balance after he exits the scene. The pity-fest continues until the end of the movie, interrupted          
                              Ive seen monogatari series from the season 1 and all the movies and mini series/side arcs. Shaft doing really good job in making this series interesting if not for them i'd definetely alrdy dropped this series long time ago, definetely will give 9 score to the main arc bakemonogatari and nisemonogatari and 7-8 score for some of the side arcs.

                              Wow, really wow. All the Kizumonogatari movie are outstanding!
                              At the time of writing this Kizumonogatari III is one of only two Anime's that I have rated a 10. It is very rare that I rate anything a 10 because I don't believe any movie/show is perfect. And this is no exception, it isn't perfect. However, the roller coaster of emotions and the astounding journey I was unexpectedly taken on took my breath away. Everything all the way down to the ending credits song I thought was perfectly placed and fit the vibe of the movie really well.
                              Kizumonogatari III is good, but not as good as I was expecting. Kizumonogatari II is better by leaps and bounds, but Kizumonogatari III is better than Kizumonogatari I.

Sometimes when you have those moments where you picture something then you say to yourself that was not reality, the image that came to my mind must be from a different world that I saw somewhere, but not that I can recall when or where. This is like opening a door deep down in your mind and behind that door lies all your lucid dreams and imaginations. watch it for sure, you can never go wrong with this.
                              This is my first review in MyAnimeList, so I apologize in advance if you find the ideas I'll put forward here badly-written, explained or structured.
                              In many ways this is a difficult review to write.  This is because I&rsquo;m clearly not the target audience, as Spirited Away is a film that is clearly targeted towards children.  In the end, I simply decided to review the film as I normally do and leave a disclaimer about not being the target audience.
                              The very facet of childhood can be boiled down to the very definition of mysterious wonder and awe-inspiring imagination. We’ve all had those moments where we would go off into our own little world of childlike imagination and try experience an entirely new reality different from our own. Films have tried to recapture the atmosphere that resembles this nostalgic feeling of experiencing the journey of childhood that either succeeded or failed. It just takes a man like Miyazaki to do just that flawlessly.
                              At the time of this writing, Spirited Away is ranked #2 among anime movies on this site.  In my opinion, that is sorely inaccurate.  Reading the reviews for it, there are a lot of remarks about the excellent animation and soundtrack (rightfully so) and the strong character design (understandably so), but beyond that, the praise begins to falter.  People struggle to justify the disjointed nature of the film, sometimes going with ""shows remarkable creativity"" and sometimes just falling back on ""makes me nostalgic.""  Viewers who liked it don't know why they liked it, and that doesn't surprise me.
                              As an Oscar-nominated animated feature by a world renowned director and studio, everyone had high expectations for this movie.
                              By far my favorite Miyazaki film, Spirited Away transported me to a place that I never wanted to leave. The visuals of this film are simply astounding. The colorful landscapes and the ornate buildings really brought the films story to life. The music was also extremely excellent. The characters were the best part of the film. Each one had their own story to tell. Most people might write this film off as a childrens movie, but in my opinion this is a movie that everyone- adults included- can watch and enjoy.           
                              Giving this a 10/10 is the equivalent of giving Dora The Explorer a 10/10.
                              As I'm aging everyday, I felt the need to reminisce about my childhood past, and so recently I decided to re-watch a whole bunch of Disney movies as well as Miyazaki (Studio Ghibili) films. (By the way, did you guys hear that Studio Ghibili is no more? Depressing news for future generations). The movies brought me to tears, and I couldn't help but feel an urge to write a review on how significantly emotional and magnificent Miyazaki's films are. Spirited Away is definitely by far the most popular of all Miyazaki's films considering he won a countless number of awards for the movie and it          
                              Unfortunately, the movie that introduced 'mainstream' America to Miyazaki is not as good as it has been advertised.
                              Spirited Away was one of my first anime. I remember my mom came home from the movie store with it one day. It was a pleasant surprise for me to find that such a film exists. After it ended I said to myself, this isn't like any other animated films I had ever seen before . . . and then I watched it a second time.
                              I'm sorry, with respect to what he's accomplished, Miyazaki can't tell a good story to save his life. As a test, ask someone who loves Spirited Away for a brief wiki-style synopsis and see if they can do it. Probably not, but it's not their fault; it's a plot based on coincidences and contrivances. The sentimentalism is manipulative & manufactured (aww, the old spider guy has developed a grandfatherly attachment to the protagonist for no reason! etc) and the usually great Joe Hisaishi is reduced to sappy Disney style orchestral ""emotional scene #50"" muzak. At a bloated two hours, I don't think good visuals are

                              No matter how you approach a review for this movie, this will always be one of the greatest animes ever made. It has fluid artwork and strong characters. And it  eschews from typical anime stereotypes. Most importantly, it has a strong moral point about growing up."
"After the fierce battle on Rakuyou, the untold past and true goal of the immortal Naraku leader, Utsuro, are finally revealed. By corrupting the Altana reserves of several planets, Utsuro has successfully triggered the intervention of the Tendoshuu’s greatest enemy: the Altana Liberation Army. With Earth as the main battleground in this interplanetary war, Utsuro's master plan to destroy the planet—and himself—is nearly complete. 

An attack on the O-Edo Central Terminal marks the beginning of the final battle to take back the land of the samurai. With the Yorozuya nowhere in sight, the bakufu all but collapsed, and the Shogun missing, the people are left completely helpless as the Liberation Army begins pillaging Edo in the name of freeing them from the Tendoshuu's rule. 

Caught in the crossfire between two equally imposing forces, can Gintoki, Kagura, Shinpachi, and the former students of Shouyou Yoshida put aside their differences and unite their allies to protect what they hold dear?

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.81,8,25,1154,129216,1081,"                              Gintama is an anime franchise with several seasons end more of 350 episodes. This season follow the events Shogun Assassination Arc, Farewell, Shinsengumi Arc and Rakuyou Decisive Battle Arc, adapting the Silver Soul Arc.
                              Reading the other reviews posted here, and guessing that people watching this have already watched all previous seasons of Gintama; this will be a short review pointing out the worst things of this season.
                              Well, it’s the beginning of the end. The real end, the one we never expected after all the hoaxes and fakes but knew nonetheless would have to come eventually. 
                              I was sort of modest with my rating of this season because I really did enjoy it, but it was a little bit slow so I hedged and went with a nine. 
                              The Silver Soul arc brings an amazing blend of comedy and action, never seen before in Gintama. One moment your in a fight and the next you are laughing your ass off. 
                              I might not be a fan of Gintama, but I would be lying if I said that this season wasn't pretty damn good.
                              *This review is spoiler free
                              The final arcs keep rolling along! Let's see... of course the story is more gripping now than ever before. We are finally seeing some questions from way back in season 1 really being fleshed out and answered. The world (especially Edo) is in more trouble than ever before. Etc. Etc.
                              This anime accelerated right as the shogun assassination arc started. Boy, it has been a journey and each episode was a joy to watch. Gintama's comedy and humour is overtaken by the more serious silver soul arc, but that is fine with me- it's still filled with its fair share of touching moments and well-animated fight scenes. 
                              (This review applies to the entire Gintama series.)
                              After a decade and two years of initial broadcast of the Gintama franchise, the time has come for the final arc. As like its previous seasons, Gintama has started to throw most of the comedy out of the window in order to finish the story and thus its franchise as well. However, the current season is something that is a bit different. Why? and How? The season is more funny compared to the previous one which is the Slip Arc (where Shinpachi is forced to shout in every scenes like it is being overused thus making the season unfunny). Moreover, the story started when the          
                              If you've got this far..... You just know that this final season is going to be epic!  Upon writing this, I do have to come to the realisation that this is the end of the road. The reality is that I'll never see another show that encapsulates so much energy and passion. People may call me out on that, but what Gintama has brought to many viewers is the hilarious, well- written comedy sketches as well as the painful, yet heartwrenching arcs throughout the years. "
"The Fifth Holy Grail War in Fuyuki City has reached a turning point in which the lives of all participants are threatened as the hidden enemy finally reveals itself. As Shirou Emiya, Rin Toosaka, and Illyasviel von Einzbern discover the true, corruptive nature of the shadow that has been rampaging throughout the city, they realize just how dire the situation is. In order to protect their beloved ones, the group must hold their own against the seemingly insurmountable enemy force—even if some of those foes were once their allies, or perhaps, something more intimate.

As the final act of this chaotic war commences, the ideals Shirou believes will soon be challenged by an excruciating dilemma: is it really possible to save a world where everything seems to have gone wrong?

                              This is candid review. Because I can't express this ultra masterpiece well. Please come with me if you're a patient person.
                              Watched it yesterday
                              First of all, would like to state that this film has popped my review cherry after hundreds of anime/movies watched. That in itself would mean of either two things, that it is terrible or that it is a masterpiece. Fortunately, it is the latter that is true. This masterpiece of a film has managed to make it my personal favourite route of the big three routes with three 2-hour films compared to two seasons of 20+ episodes each and one single 24 episodes anime. Now proceeding with the review.
                              Just watched it last night and I want to preface this (non-spoiler) review by saying that I feel blessed to have been able to catch this in a cinema despite these unprecedented times. I hope that all Fate fans will get the opportunity to experience watching this in a cinema as the world recovers.
                              Anime has offered many amazing works of psychological and philosophical exploration. The medium is ripe for exploring these themes with the ability of animation to depict the surreal in ways live action cannot. These works demand a certain level of risk, as it's far easier to tell the audience what they want to hear rather than what they need to hear. Heaven's Feel feels like the excited musings of a young fan of this genre that thinks they're ready to join the ranks of the elite but lacks the modesty to understand they have much to learn. It wants to play with the big boys,

                              When I walked out of the theatre after watching this, I couldn't believe what I had just witnessed. It was like some Lovecraftian shit where my human mind could not comprehend what had happened. What I know for sure is that this is hands down, without a shadow of a doubt, the best anime movie I have ever seen.
                              Ufotable outdid themselves with this movie. This film easily has the best animation in the entire Fate franchise. Perhaps even Fate's best animated fight, and most epic scenes. If you want an amazing soundtrack, this movie has it. This is the conclusion of this trilogy, and I haven't seen a more epic conclusion in a long time. As a fan of the Fate franchise, I loved these characters from the start, and seeing their stories come to an end here left me satisfied. I love this movie, and I love Fate.
                              I had the privilege to watch this in theater, and my oh my what a good movie from ufotable.

"Even after having risen to the utmost rank of shun'ichi, Yotaro struggles to find his own identity in the world of rakugo. Caught between his master's teachings and the late Sukeroku's unique style, his performance lacks an important ingredient—ego. And while his popularity packs the theaters, he is but one of the few; rakugo is under threat of being eclipsed.

Meanwhile Yakumo, regarded by many as the last bastion of preserving the popularity of rakugo, struggles to cope with his elderly state. Even though his performances are still stellar, he fears that he is nearing his limits. His doubts grow stronger as an old friend creeps ever closer. Konatsu, for her part, attempts to raise her son as a single mother, which Yotaro is heavily opposed to. Instead, he seeks to persuade her to marry him and in turn raise her son as his own.

In Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu: Sukeroku Futatabi-hen, the curtains fall on Yotaro and Yakumo's story, tasked with restoring the near-obsolete art form as well as overcoming their internal conflicts.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.78,8,29,1059,141211,2639,"                              The second season of Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu cemented the series as an undeniable masterpiece for me is what I wish I would be saying right now. However the second season lost a lot of the aspects that made the first season of Rakugo great for me.
                              Not only is this show not up to par in comparison to it's predecessor, but simply wouldn't be worth your time or consideration without it's lineage. 
                              When something moves you to tears, it's daunting to explain why. How can I possibly put into words how much of an emotional impact a single piece of media had on me? All I can do is try and hope that you decide to give it a chance.
                              Nostalgia is a powerful thing. Happiness is essential, for when death comes, we want to look back fondly at our lives. It's only natural, really. It's only natural that we feel this way, and it's only natural that this is the conclusion to such a wonderful work of art. With that sentimental tangent, back on track, though expect that to be the tone of this review. Death, or rather, actually dying and no longer being able to experience anything for all of eternity is something that legitimately frightens me, and it has since childhood. Leaving a legacy that you won't see, possibly not even knowing          
                              Coming off the highly acclaimed and one of the best anime of 2016, Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu, comes it's second season and it's... I don't really know to describe how good this is, but that's just how good it is..If that makes sense. It's light, It's beautiful, It's haunting, It's deep, It's dramatic. It's one of the most masterfully made anime there is. 
                              I never thought will give this series 10/10 score at first, after read it sypno I tought it will become a mediocore anime, but it turnout I found a masterpiece instead. And that shock me to found one in ""New Generation"" anime which is I expected full of mediocore.
                              The first season of Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu was personally my favorite anime of 2016. It was such a breath of fresh air for the slice-of-life genre with its traditional period drama setting that inevitably clashes with the modernization of society. Who would have thought that something like rakugo can hold such power when it comes to crafting mesmerizing narratives? Personally, I would’ve found it boring when I get to see a performance live. However, the show executes this art of storytelling so well that it never fails to catch my attention. The way it shows the perspective of the audience and the storyteller in          
                              Holy shit this anime is a fucking masterpiece. I'm not trying to be a hypebeast right now when I say that this anime is truly superb. The characters are treated extremely well and given ample space and time to grow and develop, the plot it interesting and plays out effectively, and the storytelling combined with the soundtrack combine to suck you in episode after episode to care about performances of an esoteric art that most watchers won't know about at the beginning but will love by the end. Goddamn. I came into this show with high expectations after the first season (which I gave a          
                              The first season of Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu was the absolute best anime of Winter, 2016, and very possibly the best anime of that entire year. It was certainly the most moving, truly adult, drama I've seen in a long time. Appropriately enough, since rakugo is the art of storytelling, the first season took the form of a story within a story, telling an incredibly moving tale of a complicated friendship, tragic choices, and the repercussions of those actions for people living in the present day. It was haunting, memorable, and it's been a very, very long year waiting for the sequel.
                              I am going to take a risky side with this review: Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu: Sukeroku Futabi-hen was disappointing. The atmosphere and the seriousness vibe was completely shakened by the new main character, which I thought was actually for the worse.
                              This isn't Rakugo, or at least this isn't the Rakugo that I knew. Descending Stories is weird and different. It constantly pushes a new idea for a show that worked so flawlessly. There's no way that I wouldn't doubt it. I was careful with approaching each new episode, gave it a chance after chance until I realized that I'm just being ridiculous and that it's exactly how it's supposed to be.
                              I don’t like Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinju. Main reason being is that the main characters’ stupidity is what caused the conflicts within the show. Right off the bat, the main focus of both arcs, Yakumo, is so fickle-minded. Come to think of it, he’s the indirect cause of Miyokichi and Sukeroku death. Now I don’t know if what he and Sukeroku had was just bromance or if he actually had feelings for him. Or if he just wants to focus on doing rakugo. But if he just manned up and dumped Miyokichi, then she could’ve just moved on with her life. But nope, he just

"In the year 2071, humanity has colonized several of the planets and moons of the solar system leaving the now uninhabitable surface of planet Earth behind. The Inter Solar System Police attempts to keep peace in the galaxy, aided in part by outlaw bounty hunters, referred to as ""Cowboys."" The ragtag team aboard the spaceship Bebop are two such individuals.

Mellow and carefree Spike Spiegel is balanced by his boisterous, pragmatic partner Jet Black as the pair makes a living chasing bounties and collecting rewards. Thrown off course by the addition of new members that they meet in their travels—Ein, a genetically engineered, highly intelligent Welsh Corgi; femme fatale Faye Valentine, an enigmatic trickster with memory loss; and the strange computer whiz kid Edward Wong—the crew embarks on thrilling adventures that unravel each member's dark and mysterious past little by little.

Not because it has no flaws, but because it has rabid fans who will defend it to the death. It has obtained the mythical “classic armor,” which is an abhorrent carte blanche, bestowed upon only the most overrated of anime, that is used to automatically defend against any sort of legitimate criticism. Cowboy Bebop certainly has good qualities, and it is relevant in how it influenced western perception of anime, but it wasn't quite groundbreaking or revolutionary in and of itself. You could argue that its audiovisuals were in fact groundbreaking, but          
                              Cowboy Bebop was originally an anime series created by Shinichiro Watanabe in 1998. It consists of 26 episodes, a mini-sode, and a theatrical movie. It was released in America in 2001, and is one of the few anime franchises to be more successful in North America than in its native Japan. I have seen the 26 tv episodes and the movie. I already know what a lot of you are doing right now after glancing at the numerical score I gave; you're hitting up the comment box on my profile and writing these exact words:
                              Only a few anime series or movies could be considered true classics, and one of the most notable shows to fall into this category is iconic not just for its style, design and animation, but also for the depth of its characters and its music.
                              Cowboy Bebop was one of the first anime that truly impressed me. 
                              Cowboy Bebop is an episodic series. By episodic, I mean that one episode doesn't necessarily lead or follow the next one. With that being said, don't expect a lot of ""plot"" in this series. You watch Cowboy Bebop for the characters, plain and simple. Spike, Faye, Jet, Ed, Ein are what make this anime arguably one of the most memorable series ever produced. The music is awesome (especially if you're a fan of Jazz), the animation is top notch (considering when the series came out), and the enjoyment value is second to none.
                              Cowboy Bebop has something that the anime world has seem to have forgotten in a coinpurse somewhere: balls.
                              Cowboy Bebop is, in effect, an episodic, slice of life sort of series revolving around our Space Cowboys (and girls) Spike, Jet, Faye and Ed. This review is here to tackle some points about the series I feel are worth mentioning, as I know it's all been said before.
                              I think its quite saddening that I don't have anything better to do than writing a review. On christmas! However, this really needs to be done at some point, and while other people are eating cookies, I'll do this one: Cowboy Bebop Review Mk II. New and improved, rated by my new guidelines!
                              There’s nothing quite like it when you come off an anime and realize how much it has built itself as this vital piece of art that has since transcended its ever-present influence on other mediums. This particular show, named Cowboy Bebop, definitely lived up the legacy it deserves of being the pinnacle of late ’90s anime that would influence a wide variety of anime leading up to the new millennium. Even with all that has been all said and done, that’s not to say that Cowboy Bebop has its fair share of hiccups.
                              ""Cowboy Bebop"" reeks. It really does. It reeks of originality, it reeks of attitude, but most of all, it reeks of perfection.
                              Story, Character, and Enjoyment: 10/10 Drama Llama? 
                              I was scared to touch this anime. Despite the reviews, despite my friend's sage advice, despite everything, I resisted for months. I didn't want to dive into something that showed only on Adult Swim at 2 in the morning on weekdays. It didn't seem like the kind of show I wanted to watch. I want to see the latest and greatest, the anime that grab the headlines, that are here and now, that are modern and are visually appealing. Cowboy Bebop didn't seem to me like it fit into any category I ever liked either. Western styled mixed with space drama? How can that even          
                              First of all, let it be known that Cowboy Bebop is an episodic anime. This changes the whole scope of the piece, as it's goal is completely different from those of more traditional ways of storytelling. And so, it shall be interpreted and criticized as such. 
                              ""Cowboy Bebop is a generally overrated Anime that now is mostly famous due to its continues element of referencing Western pop culture, high-quality OST, and well-animated action sequences, however, doesn’t offer neither too much in actual substance nor actual characterization worth mentioning in its episodic narrative"".
                              I have been putting Cowboy Bebop off for a month or two, watching an episode here, watching an episode there, dropping it, putting it on hold, picking it back up again, etc. It's a little hard to get into considering it is solely character driven from the first episode on, and since you don't even find out...anything...about the characters until the tenth or so episode, there isn't much to work off of in the ""do I or don't I"" character like/attachment department.

"Apparitions, oddities, and gods continue to manifest around Koyomi Araragi and his close-knit group of friends: Tsubasa Hanekawa, the group's modest genius; Shinobu Oshino, the resident doughnut-loving vampire; athletic deviant Suruga Kanbaru; bite-happy spirit Mayoi Hachikuji; Koyomi's cutesy stalker Nadeko Sengoku; and Hitagi Senjogahara, the poignant tsundere.

Monogatari Series: Second Season revolves around these individuals and their struggle to overcome the darkness that is rapidly approaching. A new semester has begun and with graduation looming over Araragi, he must quickly decide the paths he will walk, as well as the relationships and friends that he'll save. But as strange events begin to unfold, Araragi is nowhere to be found, and a vicious tiger apparition has appeared in his absence. Hanekawa has become its target, and she must fend for herself—or bow to the creature's perspective on the feebleness of humanity.

                              Since the release of Bakemonogatari, the first part of Monogatari series, this unique show has been splitting the community in two parts, one side being the Monogatari fans, like myself, who threat it like a rare philosophical gem of the anime universe, and the other side which sees it as just another harem show that tries to cover the fanservice with some 'random' philosophy.
                              Even though it’s been over half a year since I saw this anime, on impulse I decided that it was about time I said a few words about it, because I feel like I almost never see anyone ever talking about the “other” side of Monogatari and the quite clear problems the show has.
                              To live in a world with apparitions, what danger will Araragi face?
                              Shaft and Nisio Isin are like peanut butter and jelly. Both are good on their own, but together, they compliment each other with such perfect synergy to form something truly amazing. They both have their own unique quirks and styles that really come together in the best way. Isin's stories are character driven, and Monogatari is no exception. Shaft has a way of injecting so much life and personality into all his characters. You instantly fall in love with each character's personality, from Hachikuji's playful insults and Kaiki's snark and cynicism. This is especially important because of the focus on character and perspective in Season          
                              Sequels to any body of work have a reputation to uphold; a certain quality it must meet to please its viewers that are eager for the return of their favorite characters and stories. This is especially the case with this little nugget of a series here.
                              After watching Nisemonogatari and Nekomonogatari: Kuro, I really thought that the future Monogatari series will never live up to Bakemonogatari and will not be as good as Bake. That's not the case though because Monogatari Series: Second Season completely blew my expectations and it was miles better than Bakemonogatari.
                              Favorite Monogatari season by far. Deep and complex character interactions(Kaiki-Senjougahara, Nadeko-Kaiki, Hachikuji-Araragi etc),most interesting stories, strong feelings and heartwarming momments.  Nekomonogatari white, second and final part of nekomonogatari completes Hanekawa's arc in the best way. I find Hanekawa's personality kind of annoying and her gimmick doesnt help her so much but in this story she presented another aspect of her essence and i find it pretty interesting and loveable. In other hand her co-competitor, Senjougahara remains a character with a difficult personality who doesnt know how to comunicate and all her act seems fake 
                              Answers a lot of questions left from the first season...
                              Brilliant! Probably the most interesting Monogatari season to date! They made many references and built upon subtle clues from the original seasons that just fascinated me. There was a ton of dialogue as well as character development that made me question who was the real protagonist of the story. The ending was a masterpiece and completely unexpected. This season was long 26 episodes, but made me crave more nonetheless. I cannot wait for more Monogatari content to be released~
                              Monogatari Series: Second Season is the continuation of the series right after the events of Nisemonogatari. As a watcher of the previous seasons of Monogatari. I am happy to say that SHAFT continues to bring out its beautiful art style which is joined by its use of sound to create a strange but unique story in the anime.
                              (Minor Onimonogatari spoilers)
                              This show is definitely one of the most unique out there, and luckily, really good. 
                              I've just finish watching this 26 episode anime, I ain't gonna fuck around and just present it the way it is. Oh and btw this an edited version.......3rd time co'z them ....you know who,  orders me to do it.
                                    Bakemonogatari is easily one of the best anime I have ever watched, that being said I expect great things from every new season. This season really let me down. I mean where was Araragi the whole season? Nadeko kind of just became the most pathetic type of yandere ever. The Hanekawa arc was such a bland and boring way to start the season. The one girl just knows everything to ever happen anywhere ever just because she knows?"
"Dr. Kenzou Tenma, an elite neurosurgeon recently engaged to his hospital director's daughter, is well on his way to ascending the hospital hierarchy. That is until one night, a seemingly small event changes Dr. Tenma's life forever. While preparing to perform surgery on someone, he gets a call from the hospital director telling him to switch patients and instead perform life-saving brain surgery on a famous performer. His fellow doctors, fiancée, and the hospital director applaud his accomplishment; but because of the switch, a poor immigrant worker is dead, causing Dr. Tenma to have a crisis of conscience.

So when a similar situation arises, Dr. Tenma stands his ground and chooses to perform surgery on the young boy Johan Liebert instead of the town's mayor. Unfortunately, this choice leads to serious ramifications for Dr. Tenma—losing his social standing being one of them. However, with the mysterious death of the director and two other doctors, Dr. Tenma's position is restored. With no evidence to convict him, he is released and goes on to attain the position of hospital director. 

Nine years later when Dr. Tenma saves the life of a criminal, his past comes back to haunt him—once again, he comes face to face with the monster he operated on. He must now embark on a quest of pursuit to make amends for the havoc spread by the one he saved.

                              If you've heard of Monster, then odds are you've probably heard of the incredible hype surrounding it. For a while, Monster has been the absolute critic's darling of anime, being the poster-boy for lofty intellectual types. Because of this, it can be very easy to imagine Monster as being overhyped.
                              Monster is an anime that I used to scoff at every time I saw high ratings for it. I was never really into long plot driven anime and I couldn't understand how so many people loved it, but seeing the ratings, I couldn't help but be interested. I downloaded this anime over a year ago and burned it on to 3 DVDs, never really intending to watch it. Maybe I did it because of the hype, decided that a highly acclaimed series like this was something every anime fan needed in his/her collection. Or maybe I just did it so I would have something to          
                              Don't trust this review. Most viewers think this show is a masterpiece, thus by probability you will most likely think the same thing. I'm going to say some harsh things in this review, but even if you think my word is the gospel, you should still watch the first few episodes of the show. And remember, a 6 is not a bad score. I did not dislike this anime at all. 
                              Monster is an anime that has lofty aspirations and does not come close to fulfilling them. It starts out fairly exciting, but it turns into an endless menagerie of typical psychological anime bullshitting that pretends to be meaningful and significant, yet ultimately says patently obvious things and never imparts any meaning at all. I cannot stress strongly enough that from about episode 40 on this anime is horrendously slow (it is probably a 7-8 level for the first 24-26 episodes, which is why I kept watching, hoping it could somehow salvage itself).
                              The writer Naoki Urasawa has a distinctive way of weaving stories, and he is one of the most capable writers when it comes to creating an element of mystery. His secret is that he knows exactly how much information is appropriate for each event, and when he should move from one event to another, so much so that he is able to take the viewer from an important and interesting event without showing it, to a completely shattered event without losing the viewer’s interest at following the story, and this is a difficult way of writing to achieve. Most writers only use it once in          
                              I never write reviews for anime that I watch, but given the ludicrously high weighted average score for Monster I feel obligated.
                              Note: Quick Review on bottom of this review
                              You know one thing that pisses me off? When something that takes itself super seriously is fucking stupid. Where to begin? Monster is already overlong as a comic, so for Madhouse to decide and stretch it even thinner boggles my mind. I thought they'd fix some blatant plot-holes and dumb shit, but for the worst of reasons they decided to remain faithful. A story that constantly tells you shit but shows you barely anything. A villain that is constantly augmented but whose supposed terrifying nature is never demonstrated. Suggestion only works if you don't shove it in people's faces. It also works better through visual          
                              ~Story~
                              Monster is a compelling Psychological, Mystery, Drama that is heavily driven by its thrilling story. Some who watch this may not be able to get into it but the rest will enjoy the experience.
                              ""Monster"" may not be the most popular of anime - unlike say, ""Death Note"" or ""Full Metal Alchemist"", there are still plenty of people who haven't seen it - but it has attained this almost mythical status as one of the anime that's come closest to being flawless. Could this really be the Holy Grail of anime? Now, being the opinionated jackass that I am, I've never shied away from obnoxiously airing my unwanted views loudly and with extreme prejudice, however controversial they may be, and a fair share of popular anime (""FLCL"", ""Elfen Lied"" and ""Clannad"" to name a few) have felt the wrath          
                              Monster is a good anime with a great story, but it had way to many little problems that just piled up, eventually destroying the actual enjoyability of the show.
                              Monster is a series that sets a very big standard for mystery anime. It was written by Naoki Urasawa and many praise it as the better Death note. I had the pleasure of watching this anime and here are my thoughts.
                              You lock eyes with a girl at a party. Soon, you're talking. A few hours later you find yourself in her room, making out with her. You start to reach for a boob when.... ""I don't want to take it any farther than this."" Just when you thought you were about to get something, you get shut down, cockteased. "
"Ghostly, primordial beings known as Mushi continue to cause mysterious changes in the lives of humans. The travelling Mushishi, Ginko, persists in trying to set right the strange and unsettling situations he encounters. Time loops, living shadows, and telepathy are among the overt effects of interference from Mushi, but more subtle symptoms that take years to be noticed also rouse Ginko's concern as he passes from village to village.

Through circumstance, Ginko has become an arbiter, determining which Mushi are blessings and which are curses. But the lines that he seeks to draw are subjective. Some of his patients would rather exercise their new powers until they are utterly consumed by them; others desperately strive to rid themselves of afflictions which are in fact protecting their lives from devastation. Those who cross paths with Mushi must learn to accept seemingly impossible consequences for their actions, and heal wounds they did not know they had. Otherwise, they risk meeting with fates beyond their comprehension.

                              It's a bit difficult to write about a series that has been hailed as one of the anime industry's greats. The first season was an atmospheric work of art, an enrapturing experience that sent chills down my spine with the end of every episode. But I'm not entirely sure that Mushishi's second season has necessarily lived up to those memories. It's still an excellent anime, and while it is better than almost anything that has come out in the past few years, there's this constant sense that something - just something - is missing. 
                              As understood by most sensible viewers that dissect the content they watch, anime, throughout the years, has become an expressive form of art in its own way. It's a medium that utilizes and relies heavily on audiovisuals in accompaniment with a script to bring a story to life; a story that takes on new impressions and interpretations depending on the creative choices taken up by those involved. Sometimes this art is used as a vehicle to service self-indulgent shows, and other times, it's used for something that's worth its salt. Regardless of the quality of the title, or the effort on the part of the          
                              ""Mushishi"" - perhaps one of the greatest anime I've ever seen. ""Masterpiece,"" as corny as it may sound, is the first word that comes to mind -- and not only regarding the second half of the second season, but regarding the entire franchise as a whole. There is, however, a catch: Mushishi is the kind of series that practically defines the phrase ""not for everyone.""
                              Ginko smokes it out while thinking about what to do.  Instead of making real choices he lets the creature in the forest come to him as he continues to smoke.  He smokes some more as he seems confident that he can smoke through just about anything.  As the never ending blunt between Ginko's mouth continues to burn, the story picks up through out the season.  You will get the urge to smoke throughout this anime.  I suggest smoking the entire you watch this good tale of how to smoke as you find whatever it is you are looking for.           
                              before you'll start reading this review i'll say that i've never written one before but i feel i need to write one because to many people overlook this hidden gem.
                              I'm gonna do my best to find new words to say about Mushishi in this review that I haven't gone over in the past, but let's just get into it and see what happens.
                              This is an example of a truly remarkable and artistic masterpiece for the anime, and perhaps entertainment world in general. 
                              Mushishi Zoku Shou season 2, or as it truly is, Mushishi season 3, steps in, giving us more of what has made so many love the Mushishi-universe.

                              Hajime no Ippo (Fighting Spirit) is a fantastic Shounen, Sports, Comedy, Action anime produced by one of the greatest studios ever (Madhouse). Even though it doesn’t tell the entire story, the story it does tell is truly amazing, with all its manliness.
                              Hajime no Ippo.
                              There are plenty of stories about a young man finding some sort of passion and following it to some sort of logical conclusion, and Hajime no Ippo chooses not to stray from that basic idea very far. Luckily for original creator Morikawa George, not straying far from this premise seems to be the recipe for a successful comic that has lasted more than 1000 chapters week after week since its original Shounen Magazine publishing in 1989. This adaptation by Madhouse and director Nishimura Satoshi is longer than your usual TV anime run, at 75 episodes, but it doesn't quite cover the incredible length of Nishimura's          
                              This is probably the best sports anime I've seen (and I've seen a bunch of them).  It isn't gorgeous visually and it isn't original and it isn't unpredictable... and I don't even like boxing.  But it's still really really entertaining to watch anyway.  And doesn't that say something?

                              Fantastic, Excellent, Superb! - Do not judge by its cover or genre. 10/10!
                              Hajime no Ippo is widely considered one the greatest if not the greatest sports anime ever made! The manga has been running since the 1980s, but it has managed to avoid feeling too stale or repetitive. Everyone simply can't get enough of this series! I will now try to explain what makes Hajime no Ippo so special to so many.
                              Hajime no Ippo is a series that was very inspiring to me.
                              Rather than try to review a ton of aspects of a 76 episode show, I want to give a few specific criticisms.
                              Ippo Makunouchi... the most evil villain who ever lived.

It has its ups and downs, the ups being the final three episodes, and the downs being the rest of the season. Only the final three episodes provide any sense of progression, be it for the characters or for the plot. Ishigami’s long awaited character arc was freaking fantastic, but the same can’t be said about the other characters'.
                              If someone shits on Kaguya-sama in front of me, I have only one reply for them. “Urusai, baaka!”
                              Once upon a time, not that long ago, an old producer of Sunrise founded an animation studio. This studio made some decent anime and some people of the anime community adored this studio. The only sadness in this studio's lifespan was that its bosses wished for a hit but did not have one. One summer day, this studio started to air an anime called ""Sword Art Online"" and it became a great hit over all the world. After that, this studio made a lot of money thanks to Sword Art Online's success and started to make more and more anime with this great amount of          
                              Are you ready to be graced by the charming Kaguya that we all got to know? Want about how much Miyuki has grown since the first season? Want to know how much love this season 2 gives to the fans? I got good news for you because Kaguya-sama Season 2 leaves no shortage for high expectations. You came to this sequel so be prepare for enlightenment by a show that reaches even greater heightss.
                              [Minor ""spoilers"" might be included here: they're not too important and merely references, just a warning for people who don't want to know absolutely anything]
                              This show is like my migraines.
                              This season; the boy won't be raised; the cutes lack the hows; Chika doesn't dance. But.. even Haddaway will get to know what tsundere's heart disease is. *Oddly loud Rick whisperer meme* ""It's war. He is referring to the war part. Ch [burp].. check the title, it's in there somewhere."" 
                              Kaguya Sama s2 is everything that we got in season 1, but 100x better. Simply put, it’s one of the best adaptations I’ve ever seen. 
                              [SPOILER WARNING]
                              I wasn’t a big fan of Kaguya-sama in the first season. While I thought it was good, it had some flaws, probably because the author, Aka Akasaka was not on par with his writing, trying different things. He quickly dropped the rip-off Death Note way of thinking for a sweet classic rom-com, way more effective towards the end of season 1. 
                              The first season of Kaguya-sama: Love is War was a breakout success. With its over the top direction and comedy along with its cast of well-rounded characters with amazing chemistry, the show became easily one of A-1 Pictures’ best works. On top of that, it was helmed by an acclaimed director of Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu, Shinichi Omata. Not only did he return for a second season, but the show would be adapting material manga fans consider to generally be better than what the first 12 episodes covered. With such lofty expectations, it’s difficult to see how a show would really top itself, at least

                              This season kaguya-sama: love is war is the most popular, funniest and most enjoyable title, and although it is true that there was not much competition, the series is as good as many think?, we will know, I will try to make the most complete review possible.

"The Abyss—a gaping chasm stretching down into the depths of the earth, filled with mysterious creatures and relics from a time long past. How did it come to be? What lies at the bottom? Countless brave individuals, known as Divers, have sought to solve these mysteries of the Abyss, fearlessly descending into its darkest realms. The best and bravest of the Divers, the White Whistles, are hailed as legends by those who remain on the surface.

Riko, daughter of the missing White Whistle Lyza the Annihilator, aspires to become like her mother and explore the furthest reaches of the Abyss. However, just a novice Red Whistle herself, she is only permitted to roam its most upper layer. Even so, Riko has a chance encounter with a mysterious robot with the appearance of an ordinary young boy. She comes to name him Reg, and he has no recollection of the events preceding his discovery. Certain that the technology to create Reg must come from deep within the Abyss, the two decide to venture forth into the chasm to recover his memories and see the bottom of the great pit with their own eyes. However, they know not of the harsh reality that is the true existence of the Abyss.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.74,8,34,95,870251,30619,"                              Made in Abyss isn't at all what it appears to be. Though it may seem little more than an adventurous children's anime, chibi art and all, it gradually reveals itself as something much darker, as Riko's and Reg's hopeless ascent continues, stumbles along, no happy ending in sight, death— and worse— awaiting them for each step they fall.
                              I want to be honest. I was evading this anime and manga. My first impression was the picture of Riko, Regu, and Nanachi, I thought: An anime about children, with some strange plot, fanservice and maybe a big bunny. I was not expecting anything from this anime. I was preparing to skip and to ""bury"" it in a review, but now I can eat my own words. This anime is a jewel. The adaptation is incredible. It has a good narrative with an impressive artistic design, combined with the most beautiful soundtrack of the year and an acceptable character development.
                              It's been a long time since I saw an anime which manages to immediately get you captivated as much as Made in Abyss did. At first glance it might look like a kids' show of sorts, but you really couldn't be much further from the truth. This is a pretty dark anime past a certain point, but even before that it's still fantastic.
                              Welcome to the most overhyped show of 2017. Made in Abyss is a perfect example of an above average show that gets hyped up by every body which forces others into believing that the show is something it really isn't. I, for a change, am not blinded by ""hype"", and can see the flaws in Made in Abyss, which are quite numerous.
                              Made in Abyss aired in the Summer season of 2017 and ran for 13 episodes; the last occupying a double time slot. It's about children who delve into a great chasm called ""The Abyss"" in order to find treasures to sell in order for their village to profit. The protagonists embark on a quest to find information about the main girl's mother.
                              On a first sight Made in Abyss does not sound too bad. A girl named Riko is about to be killed by a giant beast when an amnesiac robot pops up and saves her. One thing leads to another and soon she is thrown into the mysterious hell pit. The setup is very interesting and very well done. The stakes and goals are immediately established, make sense, and make you want to know more. I got amazed by how well we were introduced to the main plot, and how good was writing in those episodes. Everything looked so fresh and different from any fantasy show          
                              I am only writing this review in light of the fact that other reviewers are giving the show 9 or 10 across the board. 
                              The Abyss is a true wonder. It is the curiosity that draws us in and leads us to our inevitable metamorphosis that comes from growing up.
                              Open up an endless world of possible settings. A Giant hole in the middle of civilization, in which lies a gigantic hole dangerous to mankind. What could it be? How does it work? What lies within it?
                              I think this series is incredibly overlooked and very overhyped at the same time.
                              I’ve always had a fascination for fictional stories about fantasy adventures that adds a bit of survival horror to the mix. The type that stick to my memories the most are those that follows a journey to the unknown. As such, Made in Abyss came as no exception when I discovered this adaptation. It’s a show bringing in mystique that captivated me from start to finish. An anime like Made in Abyss takes on an approach with dynamic emotions to heart and it’s really an anime that people shouldn’t miss out.
                              Lost destiny, power at a price, the tolls of exploration. That is what goes on to drive them, to lead destiny forward to a world behind comprehension. That is.... the Abyss. 
                              They actually tried.
                              You can't say shows featuring a combination of lolis, furries and traps are all shit anymore because of this amazing adaptation of an exceptional manga. Bummer, innit?
                              Only the first paragraph is spoiler-free."
"Continuing their perilous descent down the Abyss, Riko, Regu, and newfound friend Nanachi reach the Abyss' fifth layer, The Sea of Corpses. Upon arriving at the research station known as Idofront, the main trio encounter the mysterious Prushka, the alleged daughter of Bondrewd, who leads them to the White Whistle responsible for Nanachi's dark past. Despite the welcoming appearances of Idofront's residents, Nanachi warns the young adventurers that things are not always what they seem. With the only route to the sixth layer shrouded in mystery and Bonedrewd's schemes awaiting them, what sacrifices must be made in order to continue the journey down to the bottom of the Abyss?

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.74,8,35,682,219420,1573,"                              I don't know what to say other than this is the best piece of media I have ever seen, and I don't think anything will ever be able to top it. I'm not even going to go into that much detail because whoever is reading this just needs to go watch this movie immediately.
                              This movie and the arc it adapted is the pinnacle and the very top of all media for me. Nothing will be able to top it, to say this movie is perfection is a massive understatement. 
                              If you're a big fan of Made in Abyss, you should watch this movie.
                              Just like the first season Dawn of the Deep soul struggles from a major identity crisis as it doesn’t know what it wants to be - a realistic and mature take on fantasy adventure or a child story with bits of nudity and gore. The movie tries to be all at once, but the story and genre are at odds with each other; it strives to have a tragic flair, but also wants to beat you over the head with fanservice and cutesy staff. The result is a boatload of forced drama and conflicts which gets resolved in 10 minutes and has no effect on          
                              Rarely does a show or movie fully capture its given arc without compromise; various cuts and streamlining measures have become generally what to expect. However, in this particular instance, Kinema Citrus have evidently gone the extra mile to make sure as little as possible is left out. Only a very negligible amount of minor content was cut or changed from the source material, and the overall experience doesn’t suffer for it in the slightest. If you’re already a fan of the series, particularly the anime, then you will know roughly what bar of quality to expect. Rich visuals, stirring soundtrack, atmospheric sound design, great attention          
                              TL;DR: A sequel film that severely damages the legacy of its predecessor by introducing cheap plot contrivances and exacerbating previous issues with uncomfortable ""fanservice"".
                              When I first watched Made in Abyss TV series, I was truly mesmerized by its storytelling and worldbuilding. It was a step above of any fantasy genre anime I have ever watched. Therefore, I was excited to watch Made in Abyss Fukaki Tamashii no Reimei in the theater. After I watched the movie, I can say for sure that it is a masterpiece. 
                              Overall the movie was decent, but it left me pretty disappointed with a few things. 
                              [This review is spoiler free, and does not discuss any specific plot beats!]

                              Beautiful on the outside, half full on the inside. 
                              Just finished the movie. I will divide the review into individual components with Tldr at end.
                              This review contains spoiler.
                              Quick Thought:
                              Ok, so this is my first review."
"Music accompanies the path of the human metronome, the prodigious pianist Kousei Arima. But after the passing of his mother, Saki Arima, Kousei falls into a downward spiral, rendering him unable to hear the sound of his own piano.

Two years later, Kousei still avoids the piano, leaving behind his admirers and rivals, and lives a colorless life alongside his friends Tsubaki Sawabe and Ryouta Watari. However, everything changes when he meets a beautiful violinist, Kaori Miyazono, who stirs up his world and sets him on a journey to face music again.

Based on the manga series of the same name, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso approaches the story of Kousei's recovery as he discovers that music is more than playing each note perfectly, and a single melody can bring in the fresh spring air of April.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.74,8,36,22,1462205,70281,"                              From a quick glance at all the other top reviews, this series seems to be one that many people rave about. While there's certainly qualities in this show that are really good, I found myself rather unimpressed to be brutally honest.
                              ""Did I reach you? I hope I did."" 
                              My Thursdays won't be the same after finishing this anime. Shigatsu has taken me to a world of music that I will never forget.
                              **SPOILER FREE REVIEW**
                              This series is overrated. It peaked my interest when I saw it on the front page at the highest rated anime on this site. I thought to myself this was worth a watch, I definitely won't be disappointed since the top rated anime here pretty much deserve to be there. How wrong was I.
                              If you don't want to read, then there’s a tl;dr at the end, as well as a tl;dr for every section.
                              Ok so, if you liked Your Lie in April for the inspiration and music aspect, then try Nodame Contabile. If you liked it for the drama, unrequited loves, and music, try Kids on the Slope.
                              ***SPOILER WARNING: PLOT ELEMENTS & ENDING REVEALED***
                              TL;DR A not unenjoyable series with some fantastic musical performances, that unfortunately suffers from forced drama, shallow characters, a drawn out, surprisingly predictable story & a tendency to have characters talk at length about what the music being played expresses rather than let us listen & hear it for ourselves. If you're looking for a tearjerker that will do everything short of poke you in the eye to get those tears flowing, Your Lie in April (YliA) might be for you. If you're looking for something more, you might want tosearch elsewhere.

                              THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS
                              Prepare yourself for a musical ride with Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso (Your Lie In April), one of the most talked about anime in the western community of late. The big question is whether the music-focused romance has earned its acclaim we’ve seen from the bulk of reviewers? I feel it’s both a yes and no, but mostly the latter. That’s not to take away from it at all. This artful, musical adventure is still better than your average anime by a long way and it’s still a show I’d encourage everyone to watch if they get a chance."
"When mankind's savagery surpasses his fear of death, there is little hope for those who wish to live honest lives. Beneath a full moon, a young boy witnesses the murder of the bandits who had enslaved him, and is then christened with a new name by the man who rescued him. This boy is Shinta, now known as Kenshin Himura, and he is destined to become a swordsman. The softness of his heart does not befit the occupation, but his desire to protect the innocent is absolute.

Rurouni Kenshin: Meiji Kenkaku Romantan - Tsuioku-hen details the origins of the man who would bear the name of Hitokiri Battousai long before he swore his oath not to kill and before he earned his reputation as an assassin. The young man's heart is divided between justice and corruption, while the fate of a nation rests on his actions.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.73,8,37,638,229235,6133,"                              Also named: &quot;Samurai X: Trust and Betrayal&quot;, this is a prequel to the anime series 'Rurouni Kenshin.&quot;
                              Surprising though it may be, it’s really incredibly rare to find a samurai anime that is actually good. As far as the samurai genre goes, Akira Kurosawa pretty much closed the book with 1954’s “Seven Samurai” and since then, is seems as if whenever anyone attempts to tackle the genre, there exists a mysterious force that compels them to strip away any and all sense of authenticity and add in superpowers, vampires, aliens, or hip-hop (not that that is necessarily a bad thing but it certainly gets tiresome). That’s one of the reasons why Rurouni Kenshin: Tsuiokuhen is so refreshing, it daringly tackles the story          
                              Battle shonen has always been a genre that is mostly frowned upon by the Anime community. Many fans tend to disregard most of the shows in that particular genre as something that is both unrealistic and imitative of one another. Add in to the fact that samurai Anime in particular always miss the point when it comes to their narrative, from the unnecessary hip hop style found in Samurai Champloo, to the redundant, hit and miss comedy that is prevalent throughout Gintama’s long run – it fails to work most of the time and it’s not hard to see why it does so. That is          
                              The word masterpiece is used too much these days.. I haven't seen anything that deserves that title as much as Rurouni Kenshin: Tsuiokuhen. While the original Rurouni Kenshin is meant as a typical shounen (comedy, action, a bit of romance?), this is a serious historical drama. Those words might turn you off, but you'll be surprised how well it is done: never is Tsuiokuhen truly slowpaced, never will the action be disappointing, never will the animation cease to amaze you. And the music. Ah, the music. Taku Iwasaki at his best.
                              Throughout the past decades, japanese history and culture is often portrayed in various mediums, in particular that of movies which often take place in the last two centuries of Japan's history. This era is characterised by a slow shift from feudal traditions to the modernization brought from the west, being the transition from the Edo period to the Meiji period, also known as the japanese revolution in 1868, of importance in this case. Rurouni Kenshin: Meiji Kenkaku Romantan - Tsuiokuhen narrates the tale of Himura Kenshin's past and his struggle with his own beliefs against the harsh reality he faced. It is truly a masterpiece,          
                              There's a part of me that wonders if this review is even necessary. Whenever I have a discussion with someone about ""great"" anime--not the ""funniest"" anime, not the ""saddest"" anime, not the best ""action"" anime, but anime that breaks boundaries and defies classifications--this OVA is mentioned without fail. Being a little late to the party, I first saw this five or six years ago; having watched Rurouni Kenshin on English television as a child, and later rewatching a subbed release, my interest was piqued when I heard that there was an OVA in the franchise that was intelligently scripted and intended for more mature audiences.          
                              All I have to say is that this is a must see for fans of the series. Even though this serves as a prequel, I would not recommend this to people who have not yet seen the TV series because the tone and style is completely different and will probably give you the wrong set of expectations for the TV series which always implements humor. While in this OAV, it’s flat out drama and full of tragedy, and none of the comedic moments of what defined the TV series is present. But does it negate the quality of this OAV? Certainly not. The pacing is          
                              Rurouni Kenshin: Tsuiokuhen is a great film (which I will classify it as throughout this review, for all intensive purposes) because of the respect that it has for its audience. Throughout the work's two hour running length there are countless opportunities presented that could've allowed for the story to introduce twists and to attempt to shock the viewer, but instead, the turns that are taken in the final quarter of the production are foreshadowed early on, and are often revealed to the viewer before they are revealed to the protagonist, Kenshin Himura.
                              Overview:
                              This OVA restored my faith in RK animation. I hate the second set of OVAs and find the TV series just too childish for my liking, but this gem has it all. It's more serious than the anime, but isn't pointless emo tragicrap like the last OVA. 
                              I figured it was about time I posted a review on one of my favorite anime of all time. Samurai X: Tsuiokuhen (Trust and Betrayal) is a masterpiece of an OVA, and the prequel to the Rurouni Kenshin anime series.
                              Samurai X: Turst/Betrayal is not like a lot of other animes. It doesn't stress swift justice, and eye for an eye sort of justice, but rather a way to live one's life (and it tells what happened to Kenshin before the series). It deals with how war can affect someone's life and the realization (looking at the story close enough) that your inner peace is where you must start if you really want to create a better world for you and others. I don't remember who said this, but someone once said, &quot;Be the change you want to see,&quot; which is what Kenshin realized. Kenshin          
                              The story created by Nobuhiro Watsuki in 1997, about the repentant killer of his past, gains new features in Rurouni Kenshin's Roe, which tells his character's bloody trajectory before his life as a wanderer.
                              This was a great series (if you could call four OVA's a series).  If I could give it a 9.5, I would.  It was fantastic, only lacking something that made my jaw completely drop, which is why I just couldn't quite give it a 10.  Totally worth watching and I would recommend this to anyone, though be immediately warned, there is a ton of blood and it can get pretty graphic (the opening of the first episode is actually as bad as it gets in terms of gruesome violence, so if can get through that, you should be good).
                              I'll be honest here. I'm not a big fan of romanticized, revisionist historical animation. And when I mean romanticized; I mean to the fullest extent of the word and any other derivation of its definition. "
"Following their participation at the Inter-High, the Karasuno High School volleyball team attempts to refocus their efforts, aiming to conquer the Spring tournament instead. 

When they receive an invitation from long-standing rival Nekoma High, Karasuno agrees to take part in a large training camp alongside many notable volleyball teams in Tokyo and even some national level players. By playing with some of the toughest teams in Japan, they hope not only to sharpen their skills, but also come up with new attacks that would strengthen them. Moreover, Hinata and Kageyama attempt to devise a more powerful weapon, one that could possibly break the sturdiest of blocks. 

Facing what may be their last chance at victory before the senior players graduate, the members of Karasuno's volleyball team must learn to settle their differences and train harder than ever if they hope to overcome formidable opponents old and new—including their archrival Aoba Jousai and its world-class setter Tooru Oikawa.

Most people don't start watching anime with the sports genre and even when they dive deeper into the vast sea of anime genres, it is one that usually is missed out.
                              This review comes from someone who actually plays volleyball, so my opinion is god ;)
                              “La semplicità è la suprema sofisticazione” or, in english, ""Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication"", one of my favorite quotes from Leonardo Da Vinci.
                              Just one more point. You take a deep breath in, trying to truncate the overwhelming anxiety infiltrating your own body. Your pulse quickens and your mouth feels like gritty sandpaper, all while trying to keep your body from collapsing out of sheer exhaustion. The raucous cheering from the crowd serves as nothing but a muffled backdrop to the sound of your intensifying heartbeat.
                              Haikyuu's second season continues with its excellent high-quality storytelling that made many fall in love with the first season. While Haikyuu is most certainly a sports anime at its core, it's also an extremely well-crafted tale of the trials and hard work that every player goes through. Most importantly, Haikyuu makes you actually care about what happens in the show. Whether it's a loss or a victory, Hinata or a player on the opposing school's volleyball team, the show manages to grasp us as viewers and force us to invest heavily in the fictional world of Haikyuu.
                              To Whom It May Concern: The following review will be an unbiased, honest & systematic review that's just to the point. I will refrain from spoilers to the best of my ability. This critical review is mainly intended for people wondering whether to watch the second season since they finished first or for newcomers who are for some odd reason wants to start this anime for second. Please don't be the latter. 
                              The second season of the Haikyuu!! surpasses the first one by having more creative “funny” moments, longer screen time for the secondary characters, and impressive plot/character development. I’m sure many of us watch anime out of enjoyment but having an anime that is motivating & inspirational will eventually leave a deeper impact — I’ve started running after watching Hinata and Kageyama run during practice, no jokes. 
                              To be honest at first i dont like volleyball that much but when i gave haikyuu!! a try it seriously made me want to watch it more. so here's my review. This is my opinion so you dont have to argue with me. XD
                              Story: After their bitter defeat against Aoba Johsai, the team carries on through training with the same determination. A summer camp filled with new and strong opponents becomes the catalyst for Karasuno's evolution. When the evolution is complete, Karasuno forges ahead to the Spring High with the same goal as always-to go to nationals. 
                              Before we begin, I'd like it to be known that this series of Haikyū! (ハイキュー!) has been highlighted as my favorite show for quite a long time. How exactly is this a big deal? Despite the ratings that I give to almost every anime being generous, I would have to say that this one is well worthy of the rating-scale at 10. There comes too of the saying that I am, in actuality, a very meticulous person when it comes down to watching a show; I'd prefer the shows that I've watched to be meaningful, containing some underlying message that may be served as a          
                              The “second season” for a lot of anime series tends to bring out amazing set-pieces, better story progression as well as the fact that, since the show was successful in the first place, the viewers would love to see more of it. Haikyuu: Second Season is a hidden gem that I loved for the first season, but this second season especially, for the first 13 episode and beyond held a special place in my heart because it was this show during Fall of 2015 that literally brought me back up to speed in terms of my education and just real life struggles. The mental impact

"In the year 2010, the Holy Empire of Britannia is establishing itself as a dominant military nation, starting with the conquest of Japan. Renamed to Area 11 after its swift defeat, Japan has seen significant resistance against these tyrants in an attempt to regain independence.

Lelouch Lamperouge, a Britannian student, unfortunately finds himself caught in a crossfire between the Britannian and the Area 11 rebel armed forces. He is able to escape, however, thanks to the timely appearance of a mysterious girl named C.C., who bestows upon him Geass, the ""Power of Kings."" Realizing the vast potential of his newfound ""power of absolute obedience,"" Lelouch embarks upon a perilous journey as the masked vigilante known as Zero, leading a merciless onslaught against Britannia in order to get revenge once and for all.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.72,8,39,15,1601244,91279,"                              Code Geass is one of my favorite anime. Why? It's filled with so much action, bombastic dialogue, and has such eye-catching visuals that it tops the charts in entertainment value. This is an exciting and epic anime and it's over the top. 
                              Alright, its taken me since April to reach this point so I may as well dispense with any further delays and say it outright.  Code Geass:  Lelouch of the Rebellion is not a masterpiece, it isn’t a great show nor is it a very good one.  What it is is a marginally good television program that takes concepts and characters from a wide variety of successful anime productions from the last decade and stitches them all together into twenty-five episodes of vulgarity and excess, a Frankenstein’s monster of a production that has the cold manufactured feel of a product of a focus          
                              Directed by Goro Taniguchi, arguably one of the best directorial talents left at studio Sunrise, and written by his Planetes screenwriter Ichiro Okouchi, Code Geass promised to be a true epic series in the making. An interesting alternate history, a lead character that promised to evolve into a ruthless rebel seeking revenge against the father and the country that ruined his and his sisters life and a dash of mecha added into the mix for good measure. So why did it turn into such a complete circus? An absolute mess of jumbled ideas never touched upon in any way that isn`t absurd or laughable, a          
                              Code Geass is set in a alternate reality where the Britannian Empire has conquered more than one third of the world and counting, and that includes Japan. In said Japan, now called &quot;Area 11&quot; - and its inhabitants &quot;elevens&quot; -, a Britannian student named Lelouch Lamperouge finds himself thrown into a cycle of events that ultimately leads to him gaining a power known as the &quot;Geass&quot;, a power allowing him to force anyone to obey any order he gives to them. Together with his hate for Britannia, he uses his newfound powers to gain followers and eventually bring forth a war against the oppressive Britannian          
                              Yet another review for the highly acclaimed Code Geass. I believe this is the 98th review C.G would’ve received; but I can’t help but review this even if so many others have. 
                              Code Geass is awesome. If you have any qualms against it, whether you dislike mecha or anything like that, put it aside and watch a few episodes. Then you'll see what I mean when I say that Code Geass is a great anime.  
                              Probably one of the most blatantly obvious train-wrecks of bad writing in the history of serial visual narrative production, shamefully destroying its own at first stimulating concept of alternate reality with awful characterizations, extremely weak script and cheap developments that only serve the purpose of working as a &ldquo;shock-factor&rdquo; to keep the audience entranced beyond the notice of a very clear lack of sequential planning.
                              Some people like to attribute Code Geass's success to the fact that it is a Sunrise mecha.  Personally, I'd like to think that it succeeds (critically) despite the fact that it is a Sunrise mecha.  Code Geass manages to establish a believable backdrop from which it launches a compelling plot along with motivated and realistic characters, something that has been missing from the last few Gundam series produced by Sunrise.  It injects a plot where the focus is finally on the characters and the events surrounding them, rather than the machines that they use to fight.  In fact, it could be          
                              Code Geass is one of those series that can inspire praise, hatred or mere ridicule, depending on what is expected or what can be tolerated. Curiously, I find entirely valid reasons behind each of those reactions. There's still a bit of this and that, to put it bluntly, but perhaps the lines aren't quite as clear as they seem.
                              There some mecha's that achieve near brilliance, and others that are rendered useless in their awkward failure. Code Geass is neither of this. 
                              At first when i heard of how great Geass was and then I learned it was a mecha show, I was a bit reluctant to watch it since I am not a big fan of mecha. But once I sat down and watched code geass I was really impressed at how good it was.
                              The other reviews available here cover a lot of details, so this will be a somewhat brief overview that will concentrate only on the main aspects, without spoilers.
                                Code Geass is the most overrated anime on the top 20 list.  
                              Code Geass is definitely a very popular anime, no denying that, but I wouldn't exactly call it a master piece, but it is however, a fun and entertaining show, you just don't need to put too much thought into it.

It was sold out in advance with huge waiting list and it was clearly visible by the TOHO Cinemas Roppogi Hills where I was pleased to see this movie. Every available seat was taken and queue was HUGE. 
                              Story isn't everything.
                              If you didn't like the anime series, won't like this either. 
                              I watched the movie in cinema yesterday.
                              There might be spoilers, 
                              To those who says the story is generic, they need to understand its not the whole story but a part of it. This anime is one of the greatest in the history of anime which is proven true by its success, those who still deny I would tell them to look at the milestones it has already crossed.
                              i watched the movie today. I feel it was one of the best shonen anime movie i have ever watched. 
                              This is my first review if i say any wrong i apologize, [This review contains spoilers]
                              Overrated, Overrated ,Overrated. I kept hearing this and tbh I had no expectations of demon slayer movie. But.. I was wronge.
                              Music: Since I'm a big fan of kajiura yuki, 12/10. 
                              I'm not a big fan of the Kimetsu no Yaiba, but my friends are.
                              Finally, this movie was released in my country (in Asia) since last weekend, and surprisingly, almost all the reaction/review for it are very positive from both fan and non-fan/just casual movie goers.
                              Let's start with the negative first. The film itself lasts almost 2 hours, and there are 2 villains. One of them is useless, and seriously because not only does that one villain have no role but the whole part with him is completely unnecessary and in no way contributes to the development of the story. In addition, too much time was wasted here to suggest that the things that happen to the main characters are used for their character development, which did not happen. There’s also the classic problem of many shonen stories, and that’s bad writing of villains and by that I mean both,          
                              When i first saw the news, saying this movie has surpassed Spirited Away and became the no 1 top grossing film in japan, i just couldn't believe it.
                              SO I just watched this anime yesterday with subtitles, and I must say this movie far exceeded my expectations by a big margin, and kudos to ufotable for making such a masterpiece, and Honestly in my opinion they took it to the next level on this one, most of you guys remember ep19 of the original anime series, but I swear they took it they the whole new level, where I can't imagine how will they make something more better than this, this is the pinnacle of the animtions style, quality, and good story execution, they literally made a simple arc in the manga a          "

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.72,8,41,91,881860,17210,"                              First of all I'd like to say this is my favorite Miyazaki Film. Why you might ask? Its the most powerful and thought provoking of all his films. It also communicates a message very differently since it has much darker overtones than his other lighthearted films. While they may be enjoyable and powerful in their own way they can never be compared to the stature of this film. I hold this one higher than the quality of Spirited Away. Which in my opinion is then most overrated Miyazaki/anime film. This is the one film that Miyazaki completed perfectly because it gave you that feeling that          
                              Warning: This review may contain significant plot spoilers and is really more intended for the thought and entertainment of those who have already watched the movie.	
                              For each new Studio Ghibli film I watch, I just get more and more convinced that they are the best animation movie studio out there. Princess Mononoke is by no means an exception.
                              Princess Mononoke was released in Japan on 1997. It is a Studio Ghibli film, written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki, and it is his seventh feature film. Having seen some of Miyazaki's best works, I can safely tell you, without any hesitation, that this is his second best movie. 
                              First off, I LOVE Hayao Miyazaki and a lot of his movies. I fell in love with Studio Ghibli’s artwork, music, and pretty much anything about them. This is one of my all time favorite movies in fact. Just the story line is so beautiful about how man and nature are supposed to live side by side but when one fights against the other, there can be both misunderstandings and consequences. The story is open to interpretation but it feels like a timeless tale. A lot of times, I found myself believing that he could have made the story in this time frame and it          
                              Ah, Princess Mononoke. It was one of the most earlier films, and anime in general, that I watched, and was captivated at first sight. 
                              “What exactly are you here for? – To see with eyes unclouded by hate.”
                              Princess Mononoke. Another classic from Hayao Miyazaki.

"Perceived as strange and feared by man, over time the misshapen ones came to be known as Mushi. Although they harbor no ill intentions towards humans, many suffer from the side effects of their existence and strange nature; exploiting the Mushi without understanding them, even unintentionally, can lead to disaster and strife for any involved. Mushishi Zoku Shou continues the story of Mushishi Ginko on his journey to help the visible world to coexist with the Mushi.

During his travels, Ginko discovers various gifted individuals—those cursed by circumstance and those maintaining a fragile symbiosis with the Mushi—inevitably confronting the question of whether humanity, talented and tortured alike, can manage the responsibility of the unseen. Moreover, as a Mushishi, Ginko must learn more about these strange beings and decide if he has the right to interfere with the complex relationships between Mushi and mankind.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.72,8,42,644,228570,1404,"                              If I were to describe Mushishi in just a few words, it would have to be 'story-telling masterpiece'. Mushishi held this title and I'm proud to say that Mushishi Zoku Shou holds it as well. When such an eloquent blend  of story writing, narration, atmosphere, art and sound come together it creates a fantastic, bone-chilling new world that those whom have the pleasure of viewing can't help but gawk at. Whether there is sadness, happiness, anguish or joy Mushishi Zoku Shou has delivered these feelings in a presentation so well-wrapped even its flaws cannot be seen. Mushishi Zoku Shou has been a remarkably soothing          
                              There is a common saying that lightning never strikes twice at the same place. The same analogy can be applied to how a sequel of a classic never reaches the quality of that of its predecessor. However, both statements are far from the truth; it’s just that we don’t often see both happen very often. But when we do see it, its nothing short of magical.
                              ""once the rain stops and real tears can be shed, I will put down roots. Until then, with the rain by my side, I will continue to drift like the clouds""
                              Back in my days absorbed into slice of life anime, a word like ""fascination"" with Mushishi understated my feelings at the time. Try ""enamoured."" ""Obsessed."" It has a likeable, highly capable protagonist with such an introspective personality. It integrated the elements of mystery, fantasy, and the supernatural in far better ways than its dystopian (Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou) or complex (Ghost in the Shell) seinen contemporaries. It should also be noted that Aniplex’s responsibility for a great deal of superior anime promised a series like this success.
                              Mushishi Zoku Shou continues the story of Ginko, a mushishi, which roughly equates to one part medicine man, one part paranormal expert. Mushi exist in a sort of gray area between living creatures and spiritual, other worldly beings. 
                              ""Now make yourself comfortable and cosy, after 8 long years your beloved mushi master Ginko will take you to the mysterious world of mushi once again."" Or that I thought before watching the series. From the very beginning I had some vague feeling that something here isn't how it should be. I mean I know it isn't an action whatsoever, but don't you think 10 seconds of completely white screen in the opening is an oversimplification? Well, who needs the opening, one may say. That's true I was going to skip it anyway. But after watching several episodes you will notice that good art and          
                               I don't think my opinion on Mushishi is going to change at all, after many years, I was beyond thrilled to have the chance to dive back into this show. Quite simply this show is just beautifully animated, written and acted. 
                              Good Day all , this review is gonna be short and I hope you gonna decide that you watch it or not from my review . 
                               I've got to admit, by the end of episode 9, I was ready for the series to end. This may be because I had been watching this anime in long sequences and being an anime with single episode arcs, it's not really an anime that is good for watching in long sequences. When I watched Mushishi, I would watch a single episode and then play video games and read. I suspect that made me enjoy it more then I would have if I watched the episodes back it back. It may also be that the stories in Mushishi were more interesting, perhaps because they          
                              Mix a few of these episodes in the original Mushishi, and hardly anyone would notice the difference. That’s not a compliment. The original Mushishi had mainly novelty value. It was a deeply flawed show with a brilliant premise. Next Passage doesn’t do much but gets more steam out of it.
                              (This review is completely my opinion, but any constructive criticism to better myself as a writer and critic is greatly appreciated) 
                              Having written a short review on Mushishi with vague statements (it's in the first season of Mushishi), I feel like writing a full fledged analytical (self proclaimed :v ) review on the series as well. I'm not giving a spoiler warning because it's not really possible to spoil Mushishi like that. But, this review will contain plot points from within the series. So it's better if you've already watched it. This will take a really long time. Alright, let's get to the point.
                               My very first review on MAL was of the 2005 anime Mushishi. I mentioned in that review that it was one of my favorite anime of all time Then I found out that there was a 2014 continuation that would be seperated into two 10 episode seasons,2 specials, and a conclusion movie. The subject of this review will be the first 10 episode season of this new saga of mushishi.
                              Alright, back with Mushishi. I'm excited to talk about the things I love about this anime and also where I'm hoping it'll improve in the future, so let's get at it. 
                              Another amazing adventure..."
"Young Thorfinn grew up listening to the stories of old sailors that had traveled the ocean and reached the place of legend, Vinland. It's said to be warm and fertile, a place where there would be no need for fighting—not at all like the frozen village in Iceland where he was born, and certainly not like his current life as a mercenary. War is his home now. Though his father once told him, ""You have no enemies, nobody does. There is nobody who it's okay to hurt,"" as he grew, Thorfinn knew that nothing was further from the truth.

The war between England and the Danes grows worse with each passing year. Death has become commonplace, and the viking mercenaries are loving every moment of it. Allying with either side will cause a massive swing in the balance of power, and the vikings are happy to make names for themselves and take any spoils they earn along the way. Among the chaos, Thorfinn must take his revenge and kill Askeladd, the man who murdered his father. The only paradise for the vikings, it seems, is the era of war and death that rages on.

                              If Don LaFonaine narrated Vinland Saga from the start, he’d begin the show with “In a world….” In Vinland Saga, we are introduced to a Viking world, a world of historical fiction rich with culture and testing the limits of survival. Based on the manga of the same name, it’s a show that teaches more than about survival. If you’re ready to embark on this epic adventure, then be ready for a 24-episode saga like you’ve never experienced before.
                              There is a profound feeling to Vinland Saga. Whether or not the events depicted are entirely accurate, you are watching monumental history unfold. Although it is frustrating at times, it's gripping in the end. 
                              The following will be more of a critique, rather than a review, so expect a lot of spoilers.
                              Greetings ladies and gentlemen, I will cut straight to the point. 
                              The first arc of Vinland Saga has been touted as one of manga’s greatest prologues. As such, many were curious about how well the anime would fare. While it may seem like a mere revenge story at first, this 24-episode series acts as a GAR infused yet slow-burning meditation on vengeance and war, as well as the thrills and horrors that await. Moreover, it's a character study revolving around the arc's main protagonists: Thorfinn and Askeladd. They make up the tragic backbone of the show, and that backbone is powerful enough to cement this show as one of the best of the year.

                              There was a time when Vinland Saga was considered unadaptable. Along with Berserk, Kingdom and Vegabond, no one would touch it for 15 years.

"Twenty-two-year-old Eikichi Onizuka—ex-biker gang leader, conqueror of Shonan, and virgin—has a dream: to become the greatest high school teacher in all of Japan. This isn't because of a passion for teaching, but because he wants a loving teenage wife when he's old and gray. Still, for a perverted, greedy, and lazy delinquent, there is more to Onizuka than meets the eye. So when he lands a job as the homeroom teacher of the Class 3-4 at the prestigious Holy Forest Academy—despite suplexing the Vice Principal—all of his talents are put to the test, as this class is particularly infamous.

Due to their utter contempt for all teachers, the class' students use psychological warfare to mentally break any new homeroom teacher they get, forcing them to quit and leave school. However, Onizuka isn't your average teacher, and he's ready for any challenge in his way.

Bullying, suicide, and sexual harassment are just a few of the issues his students face daily. By tackling the roots of their problems, Onizuka supports them with his unpredictable and unconventional methods—even if it means jumping off a building to save a suicidal child. Thanks to his eccentric charm and fun-loving nature, Class 3-4 slowly learns just how enjoyable school can be when you're the pupils of the Great Teacher Onizuka.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.7,8,44,186,591976,20924,"                              Great Teacher Onizuka had some potential, but all of the humor is repetitive and juvenile, while unrealistic dramatic scenes dominate the plot more and more as the series drags on. It basically fails on both fronts. Plot points and devices are reused to the point where they become dull, and they get increasingly ridiculous as the series progresses. Not in a good way, of course. Holy melodrama, batman! This anime is chock full of bullshit backstories that are supposed to make us go “awwwwww, they’re not a bad guy/girl after all!” by the way. Yeah, it’s definitely as irritating and ineffective as it sounds. 
                              Eikichi Onizuka. 22 years old. Even as Japan keeps turning out more new anime, there’s still perfectly good series out there from the past, and that’s especially true for people who might have been introduced to anime just recently. It’s hard to believe that GTO will be 10 years old this June, but age has nothing to do with a good anime. So I’ve devoted the last few days of my life to this series.
                              I finished this series a while back but i was bored so i decided to write this..
                              Great Teacher Onizuka... heheh and what a great teacher he is. A really original and good anime filled with comedy, action, and a few serious moments, an animation that has given life to one of the most memorable characters i've seen, Onizuka Eichi.

                              Animation - 7
                              While I usually steer away from ecchi anime, this an anime I will ALWAYS  make an exception for. Yeah, the art is dated, and the dubbing is so bad it's good. It's the story and the characters that shine though. the jokes are spot on, the running gags are spot on, and the lessons  he teaches his students are just amazing! I love the idea of student and teacher relationships (I mean the idea of being trapped in a room with a stranger that you don't know on the first day and gradually either love or hate them yet either way you're forced          
                              If I had a teacher like Onizuka I would actually have enjoyed school and looked forward to attending every day. The show itself is good but he makes it great. For those of you who have yet to watch it, please let me try and convince you with a short review to give it a try. This is my review.
                              Great Teacher Onizuka is a pretty cool dude. Sure he might be a bit of an idiot and has an unnatural perversion towards high school girls, but there is one thing he excels at and that’s knowing how to help his students. The lengths at which he goes to save some of them with disregard of his own safety is something rarely seen.
                              Let me start off by saying I'm a huge fan of GTO's manga, the source of all its zany, raunchy material. It's easily my favorite manga of all time, and because it is such, I have high expectations for the anime. Perhaps my expectations were unreasonably high, but regardless, I wasn't nearly as happy with the anime as I was with the manga. 
                              ""A brat who is afraid to be hurt isn't qualified to love someone."" - Eikichi Onizuka
                              Great Teacher Onizuka is a very popular title. Let us see why. The series focuses on the life of Onizuka Eikichi, who is an ex-bike gang leader. The man has only one goal now-- to become the greatest teacher in Japan. While doing his teaching internship as part of his studies to become a qualified teacher, he ends up not in an all-girls class as he has been dreaming for awhile, but in a delinquent class. There Onizuka learns the importance of the power and respect gained from one's students. Thanks to pure luck, or Onizuka’s shining charisma, after internship he gets a job at          
                              Great Teacher Onizuka is a heart-warming show, it's one of my personal favorites, but I will sincerely try not to be a biased reviewer.  That being said, Great Teacher Onizuka is a hilarious, laughable roller-coaster ride centering around a perverse ex-motor-bike gang-leader gone teacher who teaches life-lessons to his students.  
                              This is my first review. 
                              For the past few decades, schools have been plagued with higher student dropout rates, increased juvenile delinquency, and child disobedience. Increasing numbers of students care less for their future and education, resorting to violence, gangs, drugs, and sex. Things that degrade society. "
"""Mushi"": the most basic forms of life in the world. They exist without any goals or purposes aside from simply ""being."" They are beyond the shackles of the words ""good"" and ""evil."" Mushi can exist in countless forms and are capable of mimicking things from the natural world such as plants, diseases, and even phenomena like rainbows.

This is, however, just a vague definition of these entities that inhabit the vibrant world of Mushishi, as to even call them a form of life would be an oversimplification. Detailed information on Mushi is scarce because the majority of humans are unaware of their existence.

So what are Mushi and why do they exist? This is the question that a ""Mushishi,"" Ginko, ponders constantly. Mushishi are those who research Mushi in hopes of understanding their place in the world's hierarchy of life.

Ginko chases rumors of occurrences that could be tied to Mushi, all for the sake of finding an answer.

It could, after all, lead to the meaning of life itself.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.69,8,45,169,622616,23098,"                              In spirit, at least, each episode of Mushishi strongly reminds me of one thing: A cave painting. A depiction of man and the outside world, brief and primal but perfectly expressive, radiating mysticism, possessed of more meaning than it first appears to have.
                              Some people will tell you Mushishi is great because it doesn’t contain action and fanservice. These must be the same people who praise a film for not including Adam Sandler. They also make Mushishi look more pretentious than it is. It’s far from it. The problem is, even though Mushishi has a worthwhile aim and the right methods, it doesn’t know how to use them.
                              It's pretty rare to see a purely episodic anime that isn't a comedy, and that's just another reason Mushishi was such a treat.
                              Worshipping triviality and being unimaginative to a certain degree, are things that a solid narrative should always strive to avoid in order to culminate fans everywhere. When a fantasy narrative fails in painting an addictive universe for the viewer to grab onto, then it has certainly failed it’s job when it comes to being a well thought out story. However, even though the case is true with most Anime and other works, some prosaic Anime manage to escape the route of obscurity by chance, and end up receiving a ton of praise and gratitude from fans everywhere, simply because of certain factors that went into          
                              This anime was a very  unique experience. The show introduces a very interesting concept called the mushi. It'd be very difficult to describe what the mushi are precisely. In a nutshell , they're essentially spiritual beings, but at the same time they inhabit the physical world ( Yeah I know what your thinking, you just completely contradicted yourself. I know, I know just go with it) and they use humans as a host ( very similar to a parasite). One aspect in particular that struck me about the show was how it was devoid of any western influences whatsoever. Many anime fans don't realize          
                              This review contains no major spoilers. I was beyond thrilled when I had finally got my hands on Mushishi in its entirety. I have to shamelessly admit that I'm pretty dang easily entertained. So typically when there is a show that EVERYONE seems to love, I tend to enjoy it just as much. Unfortunately, once I got around to getting into the series I found a number of issues that others just didn't seem to have. I was entertained on a number of episodes, and definitely compelled to complete it. However, this certainly wasn't the masterpiece I thought I was about to watch.
                              So what reason could there be to praise a show that's been reviewed four times already, receiving highest marks? The answer is simple enough: it's been a long time since an anime has impressed me as much as Mushishi did. Going beyond the boundaries of the entertainment-based pop culture, this deserves the term 'art' in every aspect.
                               A compelling, mysterious and thought-provoking anime on being's known as Mushi. This unique show proves that an anime doesn't need to have romance, action, comedy or something thrilling to be interesting to watch.
                              Mushishi is, to tell the truth, nothing very special. It doesn't try to stand out, nor does it feed us with anime standards, like moe, or fanservice. it doesn't have flashy action - hardly any at all in fact - nor has it excessive amounts of blood. In fact this in itself is what makes it stand up. Its tranquility and taking things at a calm pace is what makes Mushishi so great, yet in a way it is also what makes it a bit offputting to some.
                              Many struggle with wrapping their heads around specific folklore that is entirely different from the cultural roots of their own country. It can be an arduous task for the ill-prepared minds that nevertheless want to explore all facets of any country’s folklore that captures the entirety of how it’s culture evolved from its roots to the present. There haven’t been many shows, or anime for that manner, that have handled folklore with the level of atmosphere and creativity that the show Mushishi has to offer and for this, we have to be thankful for its existence. A beautiful existence to be more specific.
                              I heard about this anime a while ago, but the synopsis didn't seem that appealing to me.  So I basically forgot about it until recently and decided to watch a few episodes to see why it was so well regarded...
                              “One direction, no destination”
                              “Mushishi is a beautiful tragedy…”
                              Overview:
                              It’s very nice that Mushishi had showed a great way of enjoying such scenery, environment, and culture of each passing scene as you might find yourself exploring its wonders and deeper meaning of it, which the series proves when you’re into this world. Starting with its bunch of supernatural and mystery that engulfs the whole series, it never crossed to my mind that it is dull, boring, typical, and all used up theme just like the others, thus, it has shown such different mixture of drama, tension, and unusual phenomenon that will surely be a factor why this show is worthy to be watched"
"Six months ago, Sakuta Azusagawa had a chance encounter with a bunny girl in a library. Ever since then, he’s been blissfully happy with his girlfriend: Mai Sakurajima, that same bunny girl. However, the reappearance of his mysterious first crush, the now-adult Shouko Makinohara, adds a new complication to his relationship with Mai. To make matters worse, he then encounters a middle school Shouko in the hospital, suffering from a grave illness. Mysteriously, his old scars begin throbbing whenever he’s near her.

With Shouko’s bizarre situation somehow revolving around him, Sakuta will need to come to terms with his own conflicting feelings, for better or worse. With a girl's life in his hands, just what can he do?

                              Going to keep this review short. For those who watched the anime series, you already know what you're getting yourself into. All the girls make an appearance and have some sort of role in the story. The main stars, however, are main girl Mai and the mysterious Shouko. And boy, do both of these girls know just what to say and do to pull on the heartstrings of not only MC Sakuta, but also the audience. Both of the girls get fully fleshed out over the course of the movie, and satisfied fans may gain (or keep) some waifus by the end.
                              Rascal Does Not Dream of a Dreaming Girl was an exceptional adaption. I went to the fan preview of this event and if I'm being honest I came into the cinema with not the worlds highest expectations, expecting the movie to be fan service. However, I was gratefully shocked. 
                              Why is this low budget powerpoint presentation with an incoherent plot sitting at an 8.72? Seriously, besides sound, what redeemable aspect is there here?
                              This movie insulted my intelligence.

                              When you think of the best time travelling anime. The anime that will most likely pop up in your mind is ""The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya"". Why? because the movie was fantastic, brilliant and it perfectly completed the puzzles of life ( referring to the confusionness of the show ) in which made me feel enlightened. Well, what if I told you that the movie no longer has the number #1 spot as the best time travelling anime movie? Or perhaps, to put this in a less offensive term. Does The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya have a newly emerged competitor that is as or better          
                              CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR ORIGINAL ANIME
                               ""Rascal Does Not Dream of a Dreaming Girl"" is the sequel to the 13-episode anime series ""Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai"" that took the internet and otaku world by storm in the forth quarter of 2018 with its flabbergasting title and premise. Adapted from the light novel series with the same name, at first glance it seemed as if it would be another adaptation of an unreasonably long and clickbait title, however it turned out to actually have a beating heart and an interesting direction to take its viewers to. The chemistry between Azusagawa Sakuta and Sakurajima Mai was reminiscing of          
                              Every now and then I will be so excited about something coming out only to be let down by the adaptation. After not knowing what to expect from the Bunny Girl anime going into it initially, like most i thought fan service, I was blown away by the show and everything about it, only wanting to delve deeper into the story. As someone who had knowledge of what was going to happen going into the theater last night to watch the movie. I was skeptical that it wouldn't live up to what I wanted. Lets just say my skepticism was way off the mark. Clover          
                              What started as a cheap way to get viewers hooked on “just another supernatural school anime” became one of the most highly regarded anime of its time, sparking loads of discussion.  Many regard the original anime as having power in its emotional payoffs but incredibly painful with its broken and inconsistent plot.  Having been built upon that already established world, there are two types of people that watched this movie: the type that ignores plot holes and contrivances to focus on character and themes, and the type that look for intellectual consistency in a story.  You either looked forward to enjoying the

                              I think the perfect way to describe this movie is to call it a journey because it really was like that. "
"Takashi Natsume, the timid youkai expert and master of the Book of Friends, continues his journey towards self-understanding and acceptance with the help of friends both new and old. His most important ally is still his gluttonous and sake-loving bodyguard, the arrogant but fiercely protective wolf spirit Madara—or Nyanko-sensei, as Madara is called when in his usual disguise of an unassuming, pudgy cat.

Natsume, while briefly separated from Nyanko-sensei, is ambushed and kidnapped by a strange group of masked, monkey-like youkai, who have spirited him away to their forest as they desperately search for the Book of Friends. Realizing that his ""servant"" has been taken out from right under his nose, Nyanko-sensei enlists the help of Natsume's youkai friends and mounts a rescue operation. However, the forest of the monkey spirits holds many dangerous enemies, including the Matoba Clan, Natsume's old nemesis.

Stretching from the formidable hideout of the Matoba to Natsume's own childhood home, Natsume Yuujinchou Shi is a sweeping but familiar return to a world of danger and friendship, where Natsume will finally confront the demons of his own past.

                              What? It's over already?! 
                              Hmm..... how do you review an anime considered to be a sleeper masterpiece? How do you place a rank on the underdog? How, I ask those who are reading this review, How?
                              This entire series is just one sad dog. However, there is an evolution to it. The first season, was like a 3 legged puppy found in a garbage bag, barely alive and bruised. The second season, was the same dog being nursed to health. Still sad mind you. The third, the dog is nearly healthy, an all the bruises are gone. Now, it's just a three legged dog with a big smile. 
                              I'm so glad i found this anime. Natsume really brought me to tears , both happy and sad. This season is probably my favorite though. It goes into deep detail about his family, his past life and his friends. Natsume begins to open up more to yokai and his human friends. This anime is honestly so uplifting. Through out the seasons , this season he finally accepts how happy he is, all the new people he met, and happily accepting that he can see yokai. I literally feel like i watched natsume grow up and toughen up into a person he truly was from the          
                               I highly suggest watching the other season's first.
                                                                     Natsume's Book of Friends
                              Of all anime I have seen Natsume Yuujinchou able to give a nice prequels something that a must watch. This fourth season is the one I will give a review because it is the one that gives me a heart-stirring. Each Natsume Yuujinchou season has a progressive story and little by little revealed the mystery. The art and sound are still stunning and relaxing. The seiyuu able to portray a calm or compose vibe to the character of Natsume. I also like the eccentric relationship of nyanko-sensei and Natsume. In this season, the one you should look forward to is the involvement of nyanko-sensei. Overall,          
                              I love Natsume Yuujinchou to bits. And, although it seems rather pointless to write a review on an instalment in a series, I actually find it beneficial to look back on each season and see what each individual season accomplished, especially since Nartsume Yuujinchou is one of those series that doesn't have an particular end goal or big boss to defeat. 
                              This season was so. freakin'. good. I did not expect this anime to go into such detail about Natsume's background-- and I loved it!

                              The review will be mainly of the first 4 seasons.
                              Overall, I had to shed many tears with the aid of  my small box of tissues while watching this series. It's also a bit-heart-wrenching, (not in a devastatingly bad way....) because of the sad memories that came back with all the flashbacks the main protagonist keeps reminiscing..but this series, and the prequels before it are very heart-lifting in a spirituous @ soulful way (I guess that's what they'd call it, maybe?) But yeah, so, if you're looking for something way off different from the charts of ""normal anime"" and want a bit of scare but with a lighter tone and maybe with a bit          
                              This anime was far beyong perfection. This may sound a little over-exaggerated, but I find this anime to be a true masterpiece. I idolize Midorikawa Yuki, the mangaka of the manga, for I love not only her stories, but also her art. It is simply beautiful and I really appreciate her talent. The music of Natsume Yuujinchou was just as beautiful and fitting as the characters. Every character had their own special trait. I loved every single one, as well as the Yokai. I could really identify myself with most of them. Natsume Takashi had made me become more aware of life and understand the

                              Warning there are spoilers in the series, so I recommend that you finish the second season before reading this review. 
                              The original Ashita no Joe is often regarded as the anime medium's first true masterpiece - in spite of some key flaws that prevent it from truly being one. As such, it is exceptional more for its time than anything else. The same cannot be said, however, of Ashita no Joe 2, which is an improvement in almost every regard.
                              Ashita no Joe 2 started out a little bit lacking, but quickly became so addictive that I made time to watch all 47 episodes within 1 week. I found it to be slightly less appealing than the original Ashita no Joe series, though it's still amazing. 
                              I know that people think  i'm Exaggerating by giving this old work 10 as an overall,but to be honest,i've seen so many anime in my life and non of those ever reach to the depth of my heart like Ashita no Joe did!
                              Sackcloth & Ashes:
                              (This review contains spoilers)
                              Ashita no Joe 2 continues the story of Joe yabuki in the dark world of boxing, but this time he will have to overcome the trauma he suffered from having his best rival rikishi killed, this time the anime manages to surpass the manga by far, it is achieved See Yabuki's ambition to reach the world title, I don't want to make spoilers, but the new characters like Carlos or Mendoza just enrich the plot because everyone has a reason and a development, everyone has their moment, there are no empty characters, everyone has something , Joe seems to be a human character, he is

                              story: 10/10
                              WOW.... I can't believe this show is over from the very first season and episode I was trapped . first it starts off kinda of slow and boring but it's usually the ones that start out that way that equal an amazing anime Anyway excuse my grammar but this show is fudging exceptional you learn the story of a young man and his conquest to achieve his happiness and bring about change in his local area as well as in himself . This season (being the last) shows just how far he's came and evolved into a mature and grateful young man . I urge          
                              The real Rocky if you ask me, in fact the manga is older than the Rocky films. By far the best sports anime of all time that tells the story of Joe, a troubled teen that has been dealt a bad hand by fate for most of his life but as a result of being homeless with no family or friends to go to he's learned to survive and fight as well. For most of his life he has drifted as a juvenile trouble making vagabond, but one day an old washed out boxer that has nothing in life but booze comes across Joe fighting

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.67,8,49,734,202941,1604,"                              To start things off, I can say is that it’s about damn time that a new anime installment of Hajime no Ippo came under way. Even though the first anime series was 70 plus episodes, I felt I didn’t get enough by the time I finished watching it. To me, Ippo vs Sendo 2 was actually the beginning!!! Since then, I decided to read the manga and currently up to date on it which is now nearly 90 volumes, and I’ll say I still haven’t gotten enough!!! But moving on, to a certain extent, New Challenger for what it covers is faithful to the manga          
                              Overview:
                              Intro: 
                              Story: 9/10
                              It's heartbreaking to see one of your favorite anime series end, so you can guess why I was so happy to hear that there was a sequel to Hajime no Ippo. I wasn't disappointed. New Challenger lived up, and passed, everything it should be. From the side splitting comedy, to the heartwarming matches; you'll never be let down. What New Challenger lacks in length, it makes up in perfection. You'll laugh, you'll cry, and then you'll laugh until you cry. You won't be able to pull away until the end. Yes, I was sad when I realized that New Challenger was only 26 episodes, but          
                              Hajime no Ippo: New Challenger, ah this brings me back. Even though most people are probably reading this review after watching the first season, I still must address this note anyways. Yes this is about boxing, but it is about so much more than that. A love of boxing, or any sport for that matter, is not needed to enjoy this show. The Ippo anime will give you an entirely new view of boxing as a whole. I'm writing this review to try and convince at least someone to look past their anti-sport anime list to watch this. 
                              When I wrote a review on the first season I was very glad to be able to write so many good things about it . All the expectations I had heading into the show were met . The 2nd season however didn't live up to my expectations at all .The show took away most of the things I loved about the first animated season . Let's take a look at the story first .While the first season had an amazing structure with builds and progress , this had little of that . I will deal with the progress issue in characters section but however lets          
                              After a few years in the wilderness, I had suspicions of the anime losing steam or having different voice actors taking roles from the originals. However this was not the case!
                              Story: 7/10
                              Hajime no Ippo: New Challenger Review
                              For me Hajime no Ippo: New Challenger picks up pretty well from where it left off. I myself didn't feel like there was any hitches. It still had a lot of the important things the first series had for me.
                              Okay if you are reading this it must mean you are watching or interested in watching this masterpiece. Hajime no ippo is truly the BEST SPORT ANIME EVER and i can say that for certain.The first season of hajime no ippo came out in 2000 and its still rank top 5 overall so the new season will be just as good or even better with almost every member of the previous season will be working in this anime so it will truly be something else. I can pretty much say for certain that this anime will blow every other anime away cuz you can't be

"That jumbled piece of architecture, that cacophony of hissing steam and creaking joints, with smoke billowing from it as it moves on its own... That castle is home to the magnificent wizard Howl, infamous for both his magical prowess and for being a womanizer—or so the rumor goes in Sophie Hatter's small town. Sophie, as the plain daughter of a hatmaker, does not expect much from her future and is content with working hard in the shop. 

However, Sophie's simple life takes a turn for the exciting when she is ensnared in a disturbing situation, and the mysterious wizard appears to rescue her. Unfortunately, this encounter, brief as it may be, spurs the vain and vengeful Witch of the Waste—in a fit of jealousy caused by a past discord with Howl—to put a curse on the maiden, turning her into an old woman.

In an endeavor to return to normal, Sophie must accompany Howl and a myriad of eccentric companions—ranging from a powerful fire demon to a hopping scarecrow—in his living castle, on a dangerous adventure as a raging war tears their kingdom apart.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.67,8,50,99,857933,18157,"                              I'd figured that waiting so long to see this made me a bad Miyazaki fan, but after seeing it, I wasn't much bothered by my long delay anymore.
                              TITLE: How's Moving Castle
                              Based on the book by Diana Wynne Jones, I approached Howl's Moving Castle after seeing Spirited Away (another Miyazaki film). Watching the opening scene we are introduced to a massive walking metal shack, the ""moving castle"" of the title. I honestly didn't know what to make of the film initially, but just that scene demonstrated to me the film's animation was going to be as good as, if not better than Spirited Away.
                              I love the Studio Ghibli films. So far I think it is safe to say that Miyazaki is my favourite anime author, and I doubt anyone will ever take his place because I have grown so attached to the work of this man and his ideals reflected on the way he conceives animation, that I can't think of a deeper connection with one's style in any way.
                              It’s never a good sign when I finish a film and the first thought that pops into my head is, “What the hell was that?” Unfortunately, that’s the situation I found myself in upon completing Howl’s Moving Castle, a film which started out promising enough before proceeding to baffle and confuse me at pretty much every turn. I’m almost convinced there was some critical plot element or thematic undercurrent that I somehow missed, to the point where I wonder if I should really be writing this review without first having a second watch to make sure that my aggravated confusion is genuinely on the film’s          
                              Howl's Moving Castle has to be the most overrated of all Miyazaki's films. While it produces legendary animation and a wonderful soundtrack, the story is dull with characters that are difficult to get attached to at all. There is very little character development and many of the characters seem absolutely useless to the plot. The relationships between the characters are also sloppily done with a rushed feeling to them, making them feel like nothing special. Also, not enough is learned about ANY of the characters' pasts and many of their actions seem inconsistent with the personalities you previously thought you knew, making it unpredictable in          
                              Howl's Moving Castle is, ultimately, just one example in the ever-growing pile of evidence as to why the word &quot;miss&quot; is never associated with Myazaki.
                              Howl's Moving Castle is a movie which is greatly acclaimed and loved. I wanted to see what I was missing out on so I watched it. 
                              Overview:
                              First off this is another great film from Hayao Miyazaki I personally loved this film the characters are bright, and vibrant with great personalities which is one of the things that makes me whatch this film over and over again.The film is also good because it can be watched by an entire family and be enjoyed on many diffrent levels,the enviroment in the film are beautifuly rendered and the range from beautiful fantasy, to early modern war periods I would reccomend this anime for anyone first off who is a Hayao Miyazaki but most importantly who is intrested in seeing a masterpiece of its own          
                              Howl's moving castle, the creator seems to enjoy making his movie have many slice of life elements such as a family atmosphere. While that is nice when it gets too prolonged, it starts to become unnecessary filler and ruins pacing, which I believe you need a good in a film. There was no exciting moments, especially with a film like this we could see more glimpses of the world, rather than focusing too much on the characters.
                              Hayao Miyazaki is rightfully considered one of the great artists working in the anime form. Eschewing the hard-edged violence that many American viewers (rightly or wrongly) associate with the form, Miyazaki creates painterly, pastoral visions filled with beauty and eccentric charm. And unlike much of anime, his characters are really animated: they live and breathe and move; they don’t just stand there filling up the composition while the extreme camera angles, moody lighting and striking character design strive to compensate for minimal movement. Moreover, the writer-director is not just a painter of pretty pictures; he fills his films with deeply felt themes (environment, war, etc)          
                              I got the book this move was based off of randomly at the library one day, and really enjoyed it. When I heard this move existed I was quite happy, that is until I actually watched it. It seemed to me that a lot of the plot was cut out, and that the characters just weren't the characters I had come to love. 
                              Previously, I've reviewed another Ghibli movie where I did explain that although it was a 5/10 and that it was mostly gonna overview the fact that I didn't like it because I was the wrong audience and give some information for some likeminded individuals. It is absolutely not the same situation here because there's plenty of things wrong and to criticize.
                              I really can't say I enjoyed this film. For me, story points and character play a large role in my investment into a film, with the art and sound playing supporting roles. "

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.66,8,51,45,1223917,68285,"                              Perhaps no other show I have viewed have I gone into with higher expectations and hype than with Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann.  Practically everyone I know has told me about how awesome it is, how its epic ending is the best thing since the invention of the internal combustion engine.  Looking back I suppose that made it inevitable for me to be let down and disappointed.
                              The show that turns boys into men.
                              Only on the rarest of occasions does an anime come along that truly grabs me and elevates itself above mere entertainment and into the realms of gripping television. Gurren Lagann did this with frightening ease, not with complexity or depth of its storyline, nor with its technical excellence, or innovation, but with its boldness, energy, sense of humour, and heart. Some people may be put off with the degree of silliness the show never ceases to deliver, or at least be deterred from becoming deeply invested in the plot or its characters, but being the sucker for just this kind of shameless splendour and over-the-top          
                              Gainax is easily one of the most well known anime studio, especially with titles like, Neon Genesis Evangelion, KareKano, and Wings of Honneamise.  However, as of late many fans claim that the quality of Gainax has dropped down significantly and that their golden age is over, well that was until Gurren Lagann.  Without a doubt Gurren Lagann took both Japanese and western fandom by storm.  This coupled with the fact that there was very little hype before hand thus, making the extreme popularity even more impressive.  For me what was more impressive was the fact that people that normally don&rsquo;t like          
                              ""The story of a man who fights to forge his own destiny.""
                              I just finished watching TTGL about a few days ago, and let me tell you all, this anime isn't rated #1 for nothing.
                              Your review is the review that will pierce the public opinion!
                              I was basically forced into watching TTGL by my brother, and I'm ever so grateful because I, like many others, had not experienced true epicness until I saw this series.
                              &quot;Who the hell do you think I am?!&quot;
                              	First of all, I'd like to point out that I do not normally watch anime about mecha. That being said, I found Gurren Lagann to be a fresh look at the genre, and one that was quite entertaining as well. Unfortunately, I do think the show has been slightly overrated (being ranked #1 on this site at the time of writing) and for this reason my expectations upon starting Gurren Lagann were somewhat higher than they should have been. I'd have probably enjoyed the show more if I'd gone in with my usual attitude toward anime of this genre and been pleasantly surprised rather than          
                              Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is a fast paced, no-holds-barred Shounen, Sci-fi, Mecha, Adventure anime that takes many of the elements that worked well, to form something that is bursting with entertainment. ^_^
                              When I hear about a company making a mecha anime, there are only two things that spring to mind: either they are brilliant, or they are goddamn blind and living under a rock. Thankfully for fans of anime worldwide, the boys and gals at Gainax are neither blind, nor living under a rock. The simple fact is that Gainax has proven one universal truth: no matter how saturated the genre may appear at any given time, there is always room for improvement. All you need is a robot with two heads, arguably the most elusive quality in a mecha.
                              Every once in a while a series comes along that, for lack of a better word, owns the competition. Ladies and gentlemen that series is Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, do not let the lengthy name intimidate you or the seemingly cartoonish style put you off  because this show is worth it and you'd sorely regret not experiencing this gem of a series. In a world where the majority considers mediocre shows such as Naruto to be masterpieces, we often overlook shows that so sorely deserve our attention and they end up just passing us by. I'm writing this review in hopes it will divert          
                              When reading some of the reviews for Gurren Lagann, I realized very quickly that a lot of people are transposing their enjoyment of the series onto their opinion of its story and characterization quality.

"Takashi Natsume has grown accustomed to his encounters with youkai through the Book of Friends, which contains the names of youkai whom his grandmother, Reiko Natsume, has sealed in contracts. These encounters allow Natsume to better understand the youkai, Reiko, and himself. 

The Book of Friends is a powerful tool that can be used to control youkai; it is sought after by both youkai and exorcists alike. Natsume just wants to live out his daily life in peace but is constantly disrupted by these experiences. If he is to end this torment, Natsume must explore more about the book and the world of exorcism, as well as begin to open his heart to those who can help him.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.65,8,52,1102,136117,937,"                              The story is a masterpiece since season 1 
                              The 6th Season of Natsume's book of friends, First of all I'm proud of how far this series has come and just how consistent it is with it's quality. It's an anime that has never disappointed me, And I hope it gets a lot more seasons.
                              My first impressions for this show after watching the first two episodes, I felt that the season would focus on motifs of Natsume growing up with unique capabilities and what life was like for him during these difficult times. It turns out that I wasn’t too far off on my hypothesis! Woot.Very much like the previous season, this new addition has been quite reflective in regards to Natsume’s past, mostly in relation to the obstacles that he faced as a child. We get to experience more concrete glimpses into the core facets via contemplative thoughts that our protagonist has about the person he used to          
                              If you've made it as far as the sixth season you're probably well aware of the charm and appeal of Natsume. What I'm here to call everyone's attention to however is this season has PEAK Nyanko-sensei animation. You will be treated to love, bounciness, cuteness, care and attention put into each frame of art that is the upmost joy to watch out of this calico cat. The likes of which you didn't realized would be topped from before. Okay, thank you for coming to my TED talk
                              So, I've made it to the sixth season of Natsume's Book of Friends. Each season, I feel like this story gets better and better and closer and closer to what I want to see from it. 
                              I wanted my first review to be about Natsume's book of friends because..MY GOD IT'S SOOO BEAUTIFUL.
                              So far among all the anime series I have watched, this one is the best. I loved all the 11 episodes of this season, especially the first 3. 
                              *Spoiler Free Review*
                              Natsume yuujinchou is one of the few shows which calms the soul. Throughout watching it, since season 1, it made me feel extremely calm and happy about the world around me. That in itself is one of it's biggest successes. Amongst all the gore, action and fast paced anime, natsume yuujinchou gives us the opportunity to look around at the world around us and appreciate beauty. It has beautiful messages in each episode about kindness and empathy, which teaches one alot.
                              Natsume Yuujinchou Roku: Another smashing success for the Natsume Yuujinchou series! Finally, Natsume has some friends...
                              It's a consistently well-done anime, each season has different things for Natsume to learn, from dealing with being honest with others, choosing to help Youkai, to even moving on from his past traumas, he moves forward and enjoys life. 
                              I'm here one more time to make a review of the best anime. Well, Natsume Yuujinchou is the most heartwarming anime I've ever watched. I've just finished watching the anime and I can really say it now: Natsume Yuujinchou NEVER disappoints me. 
                              To be honest, in just 4 days, I finished watching all the 5 seasons of this anime, oh boy no regrets. Probably the only anime I binge-watched all of its seasons religiously, even though I'm a pretty busy person because of work, I HAVE to find time to binge-watch this show because it's just amazing and heartwarming. 
                              The story line of Natsume Yuujinchou is impeccable and it left me with an incredibly warm feeling after watching every single episode. The opening and ending songs really tie in well together with the plot, and it is one of the few animes where i do not skip through the ops and eds. I followed this series for a long time already, but there is still the unwavering anticipation for the next episode/ season to come out.
                              If you are here reading the review for the sixth season then you must have already watched the previous seasons, I presume. "
"One cold Christmas day, Kyon heads over to school and the SOS Brigade's holiday celebration, only to realize that Haruhi Suzumiya seems to have disappeared. Moreover, no one even remembers her or the SOS Brigade; Mikuru Asahina knows nothing and is now afraid of him, and Itsuki Koizumi has also gone missing. The Literature Club, formed only by an uncharacteristically shy Yuki Nagato, now occupies the old SOS club room.

Suzumiya Haruhi no Shoushitsu is based on the fourth light novel of the acclaimed Haruhi series and is set after the events of the anime series. Not uncultured in the supernatural, Kyon will have to deal with his whole life turned upside down like a bad joke, and maybe it's better that way.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.65,8,53,245,489182,11622,"                              Assuming that a standard episode is about 20 minutes long, many would ask, “Couldn’t they just have taken out some “Endless Eight” episodes and add this movie into the 2009 Haruhi season?” However, with The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya being 2 hours and 40 minutes, it would not be possible to fit it into a 14 episode season without condensing the majority of the plot and the monologues of Kyon.
                              I’ve always had mixed feelings about the show where the esper, the alien, the time traveler, and the normal highschool student all gathered together to entertain that certain ecstatic girl. However, as time passed by, it ended up being one of my favourite guilty pleasures. How could I forget the super fun misadventures of the SOS Brigade? Kyon’s snarky attitude? Haruhi’s one of a kind personality? And, most of all, Mikuru’s tea?
                              First off i would like to start this review by saying that I found this movie very enjoyable. It was good just like the original series but possessed a different tone and threw in different elements that helped me see what was going on in the world a little deeper.
                              In a time when originality is something rare to find in animes, it is the way the content is delivered that defines whether a show becomes great or not, and in this aspect the Haruhi Suzumiya series is when it shines the most. Everyone that knows the series knows that this franchise has always been the ""odd guy"" that stands out when it comes to the way things are presented or given to the fans, with jumbled chronological airing, or slipping new episodes into what would be otherwise a ""re-run"" of the old series, or repeating the same events for 8 different episodes. While the

                              Hmmm writing a review for the Haruhi Movie is a bit tough, as its not something you'd want to screw up, so lets take a quick look back as to why that is. Haruhi started off as an original an innovative series that captured the heart of many portraying the life of a girl with God like powers as seen through the eyes of a sarcastic yet very relatable boy. The series was a huge success and even to this day you can walk into any internet forum, type something about aliens, espers, and time travelers, and at least somebody will understand what your talking          
                              Perhaps the best 2 hours of my life today re-watching this film. I absolutely enjoyed watching Suzumiya Haruhi no Shoushitsu again! It was  a major upgrade in terms of story and character relationships from the anime. Few things I loved about the movie was the outstanding story and relationships between the SOS brigade. When you watch the anime (not the movie) it can be quite the chore actually trying to get through it. However the movie adds to the story that interesting ""But what if"" factor and it just completely re-write everything into..dare I say ""Greatness!""
                              So after the debacle which was the endless eight I came into The Disappearance of Hrauhi Suzumiya with just as much scepticism as when I first entered the franchise. This time, however, I was overwhelmed with surprises.
                              *Spoilers for Suzumiya Haruhi no Shoushitsu*
                              **SPOILER FREE REVIEW**
                              Let me be blunt: The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya was, unquestionably, mediocre, nearly pointless drivel. I will never understand how the anime garnered the popularity it did with those two seasons.
                              I was never a really big fan of Haruhi to begin with. I watched the first season because of recommendations and word of mouth. The premise itself was interesting to say the least, perhaps a little dumb. High school girl has deity-esque powers and controls the world around her with her emotions without actually knowing that? Not to mention that it was again up to a bunch of high school kids to save the world from her mood swings...yeah it sounds pretty dumb on paper. What made it work so well for me was the main character nobody ever thought would make a good main          
                              The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya was never a series I liked a lot. I watch the latest anime craze go by and I never watch the 'trendy' anime until months even years after it's completion. Due to this, I believe I lose the extra 'oomph' that makes everyone love the new 'trendy' anime so much.
                              I'll be blunt right up front and to the point. Suzumiya Haruhi no Shoushitsu is a fine movie, great even depending on how you view it but it has a few overwhelming flaws that keep it from being all that I could be. But before I get too far into that I will put this up since, this review is not going to garner much sympathy. I liked the original series and that in no way holds sway over the opinion I'm about to state. So no more stalling on to the review.
                              Until I saw this movie, I was rather unimpressed with the Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya anime.  I had seen the first season and really liked it, but the second season severely disillusioned me.  I got it into my head that the things that drew me into the original 14 episodes were the art, the humor, the variety, and the novelty.  With Season 2, it seemed that once you took those away and focused on the plot, the anime was mediocre at best."
"Surrounded by a forest and a gated entrance, the Grace Field House is inhabited by orphans happily living together as one big family, looked after by their ""Mama,"" Isabella. Although they are required to take tests daily, the children are free to spend their time as they see fit, usually playing outside, as long as they do not venture too far from the orphanage—a rule they are expected to follow no matter what. However, all good times must come to an end, as every few months, a child is adopted and sent to live with their new family, never to be heard from again.

However, the three oldest siblings have their suspicions about what is actually happening at the orphanage, and they are about to discover the cruel fate that awaits the children living at Grace Field, including the twisted nature of their beloved Mama.

Then again it needs to be said that it is not very similar to most other things from the same magazine.
                              *SPOILER WARNING. I WILL BE SPOILING THE FIRST EPISODE OF THIS SHOW. IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOU GO IN BLIND TO GET THE FULL EFFECT OF THIS SHOW IF YOU HAVE NOT WATCHED IT ALREADY*
                              Yakusoku no Neverland is a great anime. Despite of it's short comings and endless possibilities of being better it's still a great piece of work I say is better than most of its counterparts. 
                              Yakusoku no Neverland is the biggest disappointment of the year so far. Not so much because it was so exceptionally bad, but because it had potential to be outstandingly great. What looked like a prime example of well-build thriller and highly atmospheric mystery end up being just a bunch of empty promises. Perhaps the English title, 'Promised Neverland' is actually a self-parody since following the series was an experience far from magical. At least one thing the series foreshows, I guess. 
                              Horror is a genre that I rarely see effectively executed in anime. In fact, the genre itself seems to be pretty scarce in the anime medium. The first episode of The Promised Neverland perfectly encapsulates how to properly utilize horror. The atmosphere is great. We’re presented with a seemingly happy orphanage life being lived out by the characters, all children, and their “mama.” Yet as the viewer, it becomes apparent that everything's not quite what it seems, and there’s just this sort of unnerving tension in the air. The presentation is also top notch. Visuals and music are handled expertly and are very complementary to          
                              The Promised Neverland is a great psychological thriller manga, but this adaptation trades complex psychological warfare for conventional horror. The mystery is simplified, the characters lack depth due to the absence of inner monologues, and the artwork is mediocre. In spite of these shortcomings, constant tension and decent scares make it watchable.
                              Let’s think for a minute on how fragile human lives is. We can die by so many different ways that it’s frightening to think about. Immortality is a far cry from a reality. In a desolate world where kids realize that their entire lives has been prepared for death, it feels like a living in a nightmare. To live in fear is also frightening to think about. Don’t believe me? Just ask Emma, Ray, and Norman.
                              The answer to this question is totally in the eye of the beholder, but in your eyes, what would you say makes a good concept? While some prefer thematic depth, others emotional poignancy, and others sheer creativity, I am of the belief a concept can only be proportionally valuable to its execution. An ingenious conceit can bog itself down an infinite number of ways in scripting, just as a stock setup can write its way to a masterpiece. The Promised Neverland is a show which constantly toes the line between squandering and strengthening its unique and exciting concept which, in the right hands, could’ve easily          
                              The Promised Neverland is the type of anime that is better enjoyed by going in blind. It heavily relies on suspense, mind games and reveals. So those who haven't watched the show should stay away from reviews and should only decide to watch it based on the genre and MAL synopsis.

"Hana, a hard-working college student, falls in love with a mysterious man who attends one of her classes though he is not an actual student. As it turns out, he is not truly human either. On a full moon night, he transforms, revealing that he is the last werewolf alive. Despite this, Hana's love remains strong, and the two ultimately decide to start a family.

Hana gives birth to two healthy children—Ame, born during rainfall, and Yuki, born during snowfall—both possessing the ability to turn into wolves, a trait inherited from their father. All too soon, however, the sudden death of her lover devastates Hana's life, leaving her to raise a peculiar family completely on her own. The stress of raising her wild-natured children in a densely populated city, all while keeping their identity a secret, culminates in a decision to move to the countryside, where she hopes Ame and Yuki can live a life free from the judgments of society. Wolf Children is the heartwarming story about the challenges of being a single mother in an unforgiving modern world.

What the film's title promises is accurate, but this is secondary to what the film is actually about. This is a movie entirely about the enduring and triumphant nature of maternal love. 
                              I saw this film yesterday and, having enjoyed it immensely, was pleased to read that it has won the award for Best Animated Feature Film at the 45th annual Sitges International Fantastic Film Festival (a Spanish film festival). This perhaps comes as little surprise given that it is the work of Mamoru Hosoda, acclaimed director of ""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"" and ""Summer Wars"" (both of which also won the same award at previous Sitges festivals). I dare say that Mamoru has exceeded himself with this film, taking observations and musings from his own life - the film supposedly being based on thoughts he          
                              [Spoiler Warning]
                              The story starts with a rather plain looking college girl and her romantic adventures with this dashingly attractive young man. It turns out that he’s a wolf-man, but the lady doesn’t care because golly, he really is quite a catch. Besides, wolves are cool, so it could be worse. He could be an uncool animal like a sea-cucumber man. They have kids together but raising them in the big city is a bit of a pain, especially since they keep turning into wolves when they get annoyed. So they move to the countryside and start a new life there. It is one half about the          
                              You know sometimes being the fans that we are of all sorts of media, you think to yourself, there's no way ""this"" could be better than ""that"", well this is one of those times you'd be wrong. I'll just start literally by saying ""Ookami Kodomo no Ame to Yuki"" is amazing 10/10 and must be watched by all. 
                              A girl meets a guy, falls in love, finds out that he's a werewolf, but doesn't mind (loving him and having his kids). Sounds familiar? Thankfully, the focus of this story is not the relationship between the couple, but between the mother and her children. Although this makes for an interesting approach to the overused concept of the relationship between humans and their wolf relatives, it falls short in producing a convincing account of their fight to overcome the odds that such a family would be up against.
                              Just a fair heads up to whoever may be reading this, this IS my very first review so bear with me.
                              Wolf Children is a good choice for you if you'd enjoy a mellow movie about a widow raising her two kids. However note that it isn't a particularly exciting or eventful movie, and it mostly focuses on how the mother attempts to raise her children and how these children develop and mature. So it becomes a bad choice if you expect anything beyond the simple lives of these people, even with the supernatural element of werewolf children, it doesn't have narrative hooks and the incentive it tries to give you from the very beginning isn't a particularly strong one to continue watching the movie, since          
                              This is my first review on this website, and I thought I'd create an account just to review this movie. Ookami Kodomo no Ame to Yuki, or Wolf Children has been recommended to me endlessly, as it was regarded (by them) to be Miyazaki material, if not better. 
                              Ookami Kodomo no Ame to Yuki, or Wolf Children, as it is called in English, is a two hour animated film directed by Hosoda Mamoru of Studio Chizu. Hosoda formerly worked at Toei Animation and Madhouse before establishing his own studio.

                              Review in brief: While Wolf Children is soothing and has some interesting ideas, putting more than a little thought into what's happening on-screen can easily throw your mind out of the aesthetic cradle the movie builds as you realize just how silly and simple the whole thing is. Considering the clear effort to make this movie a poignant fantasy about a struggling family, it can safely be said that it’s not trying to be either of those things.

                              So far this continuation of Re:Zero keeps delivering, just business as usual. No OP or ED so far either, with almost 30 min long episodes. More content and love to the people!
                              So after a very great part one of season two. How is part 2 of this season fairing compared to the previous part and Re:Zero as a whole? Let me tell you!
                              Everybody loves Re:Zero. At the time of writing this, the first season sits at #21 on MAL’s popularity chart. The first half of the second season is ranked within the top 100 anime of all time by user ratings. And season 2 part 2 is currently sitting at #40 in those same ratings. So I guess it’s up to me to be the lone dissenting voice in the crowd: while I liked the original show, I do not like this sequel.
                              Re:zero will be a zero no matter how it resume.
                              Nobody I know understands the story now. The sanctuary arc has taken so long and has so much exposition that there is no room for enjoyment.
                              The Re:Zero anime inspires an incredible amount of zealousness in its fans, but otherwise lacks remarkable qualities. It has its entertaining moments, decent shots for art, and a reasonably solid sound track. The plot is convoluted and can drag quite a bit, but if you manage to follow it, has substance. The characters, however, are a weak point for me. The show's protagonist seems to have an inescapable gravitational pull which ultimately pulls every character and plot point in until he is the focus of everyone's world. I imagine this isn't a problem for those who are big fans of Subaru or are self-inserting as          
                              -CAUTION: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS-
                              I never understood why Re Zero is considered as a great show. Re Zero started off strong with S1 and used the MC's powers as a proper way to tell the story, but going forward it was just used a tool for lazy story writing. S2 Part 1 was a dragged out mess and S2 Part 1 is basically flashbacks the show. People complain about how anime often uses simply flashbacks as a mean of making people care about the characters, so the master writing of Re Zero decided to call it 'trials' and decided it was the best thing ever. Apparently Re Zero's MC          
                              The best parts of season 2 have been the character backstories and in part 2 we get to learn about the more mysterious characters (including Otto) which sets up the plot to become more interesting as it goes along. Subaru's relationship (situationship?) with Emilia also progresses (kinda) and stops being an awkward hot mess (finally).
                              Oh boy, the story on how to turn a okay-ish anime with potential into complete garbage with later seasons.
                              The second part of the second seasons seems to be the conclusion of all the mysteries which unfolded upon us in the first part.

"The Great War finally came to an end after four long years of conflict; fractured in two, the continent of Telesis slowly began to flourish once again. Caught up in the bloodshed was Violet Evergarden, a young girl raised for the sole purpose of decimating enemy lines. Hospitalized and maimed in a bloody skirmish during the War's final leg, she was left with only words from the person she held dearest, but with no understanding of their meaning.

Recovering from her wounds, Violet starts a new life working at CH Postal Services after a falling out with her new intended guardian family. There, she witnesses by pure chance the work of an ""Auto Memory Doll,"" amanuenses that transcribe people's thoughts and feelings into words on paper. Moved by the notion, Violet begins work as an Auto Memory Doll, a trade that will take her on an adventure, one that will reshape the lives of her clients and hopefully lead to self-discovery.

At least that’s what it looked like on the surface. The light novel series earned the grand prize from the Fifth Kyoto Animation in the novel category. Even with two volumes, my expectations going into this anime was high. In particular, the sheer visual quality is a sight to feast on. However, Violet Evergarden isn’t exactly just known for that but does that mean it’s something to be praised?

The main heroine is an ice cold, killing machine with supernatural abilities and amnesia. Sounds pretty anime so far. However, her country is now at peace and her days of slaughtering faceless mooks are over. So, she decides to get a career ghost writing love letters in order to learn what love is like. The way to get a 9.00 rating on MAL is apparently to mix Elfen Lied with Cyrano de Bergerac.
                              RANT WARNING: Too many anime fans, apparently, have become accustomed to having things spelled out for them via some combination of long narration and excessively expository dialogue between characters.
                              Violet Evergarden was one of the most anticipated anime of the winter season, with its stunning promotional material showcasing beautifully animated scenes and character designs. It could be said that in that regard it was amazing and lived up to expectations. However, when it comes to the characters and overall narrative, sadly it isn't nearly as good as it could have been. The main problem can be associated with a lackluster cast of characters in combination with a seemingly aimless narrative.
                              Violet Evergarden is an anime series adaptation of the novel light with the same title from Kyoto Animation.

                              Sincere. If I were to describe Violet Evergarden with a single word, it would be just that, sincere. It is a slow burn slice of life that makes up for its lack of narrative complexity with earnest, empathetic drama.

Mere month after I've seen final Fate/stay night Heaven's Feel movie I come back this time to Kyoto. Is it better than super hit from ufotable? It doesn't matter actually, I'm speechless. And in love. TV series has few flaws, plot pretty bland and predictable, simplified to the border.

                              I see that all of the first 3 reviews gave this movie a perfect 10/10. I can understand where their opinion comes from and respect people who think this was a perfect ending for Violet's story, but I have to personally disagree and give this film a 7/10. It's still far better than average, but the ending misses the mark entirely for me. I will state my reasons below, first in a spoiler-free section and then in a spoiler section.
                              I could not believe my eyes.
                              Whether you will like this movie or not depends on one thing, and one thing only.
                              This will be spoiler free:D 
                              First of all, thank you KyoAni for giving out such masterpiece despite suffering through a horrific incident. 
                              As time passes, nothing stays the same. Familiar places become unfamiliar, and even people you have known for many years will change along with the passage of time. Violet Evergarden Movie masterfully explores this theme by following the life of its protagonist, Violet Evergarden. 
                              I do not usually write reviews for anime, but after seeing the Violet Evergarden film today here in Sydney, I just felt like I have to put a few words down regarding my own opinions and views of this amazing film I just witnessed. I remember leaving the cinema stunned and speechless, there are a few anime films that leave me with the same feeling of awe because of the depth and power of its artistic beauty and emotional depth. I can definitely state that the Violet Evergarden film – for me at least – is one of those rare anime films; like Princess Mononoke;          
                              Mild Spoilers are in this review
                              ""Violet Evergarden"" (VE) is a story about what it means to be human. Our titular protagonist starts off as a machine-like soldier, a weapon of war. When the war ends, she's hired to serve as a Doll - exemplary servants charged with crafting tailor-made letters for their clients. Violet's profession leads her to encounter people from various walks of life. She acts as a first-hand witness to her clients' humanity, watching as their desires and feelings gradually emerge. Violet's letters conveyed emotions to others, and those emotions reached her in turn. Her empathy blossoms, transforming the stoic Doll into a caring, resilient individual. Now that          
                              I can't express in words how this movie was so breathtaking and captivating. The art, the character, the story, the music, and more all played a wonderful part and it all made sense. I can't tell you the number of times the movie moved me to tears. I'm honestly still a little tearful as I write this. I am giving this 10/10 for being able to convey emotion and the struggles on how it is to convey it at times. I give it a 10/10 because at times I feel as though my empathy for others has lessened over some time, I felt rather numb          
                              Beautiful and meaningful; just like I wanted!
                              Yet again, KyoAni wields the power of words hardly spoken, the power of human emotion, and the power of masterful animation, sound and art to work their way into the hearts of their audience. The conflict, pain, longing and regret in our characters are gripping, and stays true to how well the series delivered it. Sasuga KyoAni."
"""The hero comes. The hero comes. The hero comes. Chant these words in your mind, and I'll surely come to you..."" This mantra is what Makoto Tsukimoto repeats as a source of motivation when he fights through the stress of not only grueling ping pong matches, but also in situations of his life. Makoto doesn't fight alone; he and his friend, Yutaka Hoshino, nicknamed Smile and Peco respectively, are two boys who have grown up playing ping pong together nearly every day. Peco, brimming with confidence, aims to be the best table tennis player in the world; Smile, on the other hand, shows little ambition. Nevertheless, the two have always stuck together, with a bond built upon their mutual love for this sport.

Every year, students from all across Japan gather for the inter-high table tennis competition to achieve national and international stardom. Through intense training and competition, only the very best persevere.

From the avant-garde director of Tatami Galaxy, Masaaki Yuasa, Ping Pong the Animation serves a tale of ambition with its fair share of bumps along the way. Whatever the odds, Peco and Smile will face them together.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.63,8,8,319,423028,3851,"                              It's a rarity nowadays to find many series or studios willing to take risks. Much of the anime industry has taken to fan-service oriented pandering and it's left me craving for something new. Something that can blow me away with it's creativity and unorthodox presentation. Utilizing its unconventional style, fantastic character development, symbolism, and occasional moments of witty dry humor, Ping Pong The Animation is that something.
                              ""Chant these words three times in your mind!"" 
                              I recently reviewed something and gave it praise for the narrative it was able to achieve in 13 episodes. I can’t help but share that sentiment in regards to what Ping Pong is able to accomplish with its 11 episodes. A transformation story from angsty adolescence to enlightened and matured adults, Ping Pong goes well and truly beyond the generic confines of the sports genre illustrating a beautiful narrative of complex emotional growth and maturation, truly cementing its place as a modern classic. 
                              Oh yeah, Ping Pong: The Animation.
                              Ping Pong The Animation is my one hundredth completed Anime up until this point in my Anime watching hobby/career, and I would feel bad about myself if I did not review this amazing Anime, and let this opportunity all go to waste. So why did I choose Ping Pong The Animation, in particular, to be my one hundredth Anime to be completed? Why not choose any other Anime out of the thousands of Anime on the site? Why Ping Pong in particular? Well, there are many good reasons for that. First of all, I wanted my one hundredth Anime to be something of great quality,          
                              ""He's got to have a hole in his defense! He's reading me—he's predicting my moves. Show me your weak point! I just can't afford to end here!"" Think these lines are from the latest battle shounen? Wrong: they're from none other than Ping Pong: The Animation! If the theme of table tennis doesn't pique your interest, looking at the show's creators certainly should. Masaaki Yuasa, known for making great creative anime, teams up with Taiyou Matsumoto, a mangaka with similar experimental tendencies: the harmless fun-filled game of table tennis suddenly got a whole lot more interesting.
                              Ping Pong won the all exciting adventure this spring season of anime was and became anime of the season. Spring 2014 winner, woohoo. 
                              Ping Pong the Animation.
                              THIS IS THE GREATEST...................................DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!!
                              An anime about sports? An anime about ping pong? I would have never thought to ever give a show like this a try, while I do like the occasional play of table tennis in my freetime and during sports at school the idea of watching others playing it in the animated form was somewhat dull but interesting. Having heard from other sources that it is actually quite good and among the best series of this season I decided to check Ping Pong: The Animation out.
                              Ping Pong The Animation, originally created by Matsumoto Taiyou, is more than what one would call unique, even more so if you just look at sports Anime.
                              To dismiss, or to even think of Ping Pong: The Animation as another sports anime would be a gross error of judgement. Ping Pong: The Animation is not about sports. It is not about Ping Pong. Not really. It is a profoundly human story; a look at the lives, passions, and motivations of characters that sound and act so real that you can’t help think of them as real flesh and blood, people with feelings, emotions and souls of their own.
                              Ping Pong: The Animation is one of the most astonishing anime I’ve ever seen. It’s something that could only come out of passion and devotion from an eccentric auteur who prides himself in the unique and extraordinary. Only masters and madmen could produce works as tight and uniquely crafted as this. It’s easy to see why this show is regarded as a masterpiece. Frankly, this anime deserves all the praise it gets.
                              The anime industry is plagued with generic harems and bad writing. But occasionally a series will appear that stands out. A diamond in the rough. Ping Pong is one of these series.

"A shinigami, as a god of death, can kill any person—provided they see their victim's face and write their victim's name in a notebook called a Death Note. One day, Ryuk, bored by the shinigami lifestyle and interested in seeing how a human would use a Death Note, drops one into the human realm.

High school student and prodigy Light Yagami stumbles upon the Death Note and—since he deplores the state of the world—tests the deadly notebook by writing a criminal's name in it. When the criminal dies immediately following his experiment with the Death Note, Light is greatly surprised and quickly recognizes how devastating the power that has fallen into his hands could be.            

With this divine capability, Light decides to extinguish all criminals in order to build a new world where crime does not exist and people worship him as a god. Police, however, quickly discover that a serial killer is targeting criminals and, consequently, try to apprehend the culprit. To do this, the Japanese investigators count on the assistance of the best detective in the world: a young and eccentric man known only by the name of L.

In fact, there are lots of good reasons but they can be summed up in one thing: this anime is amazing. Want to know why? Then just keep on reading.
                              Allow me to explain my love of ""the pay off"" in entertainment:

                              Q: What happens when an unstoppable Mary Sue meets an immovable Mary Sue? 
                              This has to be one of the most ingenious shows ever!
                              There's something fundamentally contrived about Death Note which takes what would normally be its best quality, the story/plot, and makes it difficult for a viewer to enjoy it once they start questioning the plot points and devices.  For different people, these are things that can either be overlooked or overtake the show absolutely, and it really depends on both how critically one wants to watch Death Note and how far they're willing to suspend their disbelief.  The major problem Death Note faces is how seriously it takes the threat of a killer notebook being dropped into the world, and how realistic a stance          
                              Death Note will forever be the best suspense anime for me..... and millions of fans.
                              Adapted by Madhouse in 2006 from the popular Shonen Jump manga written by Ohba Tsugumi and drawn by Obata Takeshi, Death Note is an entertaining ride if an ultimately shallow work.  Unless you just got into the fandom, I’ll assume you are already familiar with the basic plot.
                              The #1 popular anime on this site, and perhaps in the world. But does Death Note deserve all that popularity and praise? People are entitled to their own opinions based off of how they perceived (if there were any) the themes in Death Note, and how much people individually enjoyed the anime. But this anime is definitely one that EVERYONE should watch and decide for themselves how much they like/dislike it. If you haven't seen Death Note yet, then I'd definitely recommend you to watch it, because in my own opinion, Death Note is the greatest anime made. Of course, I may have over-thought the          
                              Death Note is probably one of the best series I&rsquo;ve ever seen. What I really like about it is that I feel the need to pay attention &ndash; that rarely happens with the other series I&rsquo;ve watched. If you blink too much you might miss what&rsquo;s happening.
                              Death Note is original, awesome, and a great anime to watch. The only reason it isn't perfect is because of Near who has to be the lamest enemy ever. Also, the ending was a total cop-out. DUMB, DUMB, DUMB. 
                              This is one of the most engaging thriller anime i have ever seen EVER. How could that be? Let me count the ways...
                              I might be the only living anime fan that hasn&rsquo;t enjoyed Death Note.  The reason really is because it seemed to be gimmicky to me.  It doesn&rsquo;t mean this series is in any way bad, no not at all, it just isn&rsquo;t my cup of tea as they say.  After about half the series I began to feel less and less like finishing, counting the number of episodes I had left to watch.  To be honest it is a quality series with many and more good features, themes, characters and ideas, but it just didn&rsquo;t mesh with me.

Several years later in that same mountain, the mushishi Ginko encounters a strange girl with weeds growing out of her body. Soon after, Ginko coincidentally runs into the now grown-up boy Yoshiro on his way off the mountain. With Yoshiro’s help, Ginko soon begins to uncover who this mysterious girl is and what happened to her.

                              This is for the entire show. All seasons and specials.
                              It's not an ending for the series, is only another special, i'm disappointed about that. 
                              It's the end of an era, and this story couldn't have gone out any better than it did in this film. Mushishi is filled with wonderful stories, tragic truths, and beautiful scenery that's all topped off with a hell of a main character. This film is no different. 
                              And so we arrive at Mushishi Zoku Shou: Suzu no Shizuku. From reading the synopsis we know that this will likely be the last part we'll ever see of the Mushishi universe.

Though living impoverished on a remote mountain, the Kamado family are able to enjoy a relatively peaceful and happy life. One day, Tanjirou decides to go down to the local village to make a little money selling charcoal. On his way back, night falls, forcing Tanjirou to take shelter in the house of a strange man, who warns him of the existence of flesh-eating demons that lurk in the woods at night.

When he finally arrives back home the next day, he is met with a horrifying sight—his whole family has been slaughtered. Worse still, the sole survivor is his sister Nezuko, who has been turned into a bloodthirsty demon. Consumed by rage and hatred, Tanjirou swears to avenge his family and stay by his only remaining sibling.

                              Kimetsu no Yaiba is a pleasant surprise. Though it first appears to merely be another overly grim and dark series lauded for its gore, it is is revealed to be much more as the series progresses. Hypocrisy, mortality, hope and despair run as prevalent themes in Tanjiro's tragic journey. The myriad ways in which this journey could reach its demise run tense in the heart and the mind of the viewer, as mercy is seldom a consideration to the demons he must annihilate.
                              Ah ufotable, the studio that keeps on giving. Before Kimetsu no Yaiba aired, news broke out that we’d get them animating the show. And to my delight, it’s a studio that earned its praise for its high caliber animation and consistently delivering quality content. Being their first 2-cour show (without a split cour break), Kimetsu no Yaiba is a special gift not just for the manga fans but anyone ready to experience a world of demons and dark fantasy.
                              Oh boy, the seasonal battle shounen that everyone raves about, what does it do right? Well to be completely honest, nothing, the only thing it got going for it is the production quality from ufotable.
                              Welp...I'm late to this party! Time to review the most overrated shonen garbage of the last 5 years! Demon Slayer is an anime that absolutely EVERYONE watched last year. Except for me of course, because I was watching bad hentai to make comedy reviews on the internet! I went in with pretty damn high expectations. As of January 2020, DS is rated the #20 greatest anime of all time on MAL and the #1 anime of all time on Kitsu. I'm dead serious! The kids on Kitsu truly think that this is the GOAT. Galactic Heroes? Ping Pong? Lain? Ashita no Joe? No! Fuck that          
                              Only cynical criticism can save us from the gooey sentimentality and naivete, but sometimes rarely a series too precious to deserve this treatment appears, offering nothing but genuine entertainment to a point where its own shortcomings start to seem very insignificant compared to its strongest merits. I may have a soft spot in my heart for this series, but all the things I found to be problematic within the work are still covered here in this review and explained why I think they can be forgiven, because even with all of its problems, this is -in its own way- one of the greatest series seen          
                              Maybe it’s just because I’ve gone old and crotchety, but I’ve been really disappointed with ufotable lately. Maybe even that is too harsh. I’ve just felt so out of touch with them for the past three and a half to four years since they seem to have completely abandoned their old selves. Whether it be the astronomical success of the Fate/Grand Order mobile game, or the fair success of their own Tales of Symphonia OVA BD sales, ufotable has apparently honed in on game adaptations. All they’ve made for TV following their 2014 re-adaptation of Studio Deen’s Fate/Stay Night, Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works, has          
                                 Ahhh, Demon Slayer. If I were to describe you in very short terms, it would be ""a show with decent to mediocre content overshadowed by its own technical achievement.""
                              Once upon a time, the anime industry came up with the perfect formula to create highly acclaimed shounen one after the other; however, as time passed, this pattern became repetitive and, while a few next-gen shounen have been able to achieve their objective following this predetermined path, most of them have faltered along the way.

                              In life sometimes you get bored of the hobbies you used to have as a child. Anime is one of them in my case. After being disappointed season after season with countless fast food adaptations. I decided to put a stop at my once favorite hobby.
                              Finally we have it, the new anime about loud teenagers with cool swords fighting the ultimate evil. Another shonen jump work which I ultimately like, but have a hard time describing the experience as not frustrating. So let’s get to that.
                              I never really write reviews, but I feel like I had to for this one.
                              Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba is a Japanese dark fantasy, adventure manga series by Koyoharu Gotōge with an anime adaptation by Ufotable, directed by Haruo Sotozaki and produced by Hikaru Kondo. Season 1 began airing on April 6th, 2019 with the final episode of the season airing on September 28th, 2019.
                              Kimetsu no Yaiba, or Demon Slayer, an overhyped, overrated and over almost everything show that fans can't stop praising and talking about this hell of a mess."

",8.6,8,70,208,549722,22151,"                              You know, I will be relentless when writing this review, but I do feel compassion for Araki’s situation when writing this story. Coming out of his enormous success with previous Jojo’s parts, having a huge follow up by fans, and probably being laurelled by praise of his editors, it would be simple for him to accommodate. To stop trying, challenging himself and coming with ways for improvement. This movement is something Araki does not fall into, though to the expense of failing hard the ceiling of his own works above him.
                              As I sat and finished watching the 39-episode saga of Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure: Golden Wind, I had a small tear in my eye. It’s aftermath result of this extraordinary adventure. Crafted from the mind of Hirohiko Araki, he managed to bring his ideas to life with brilliance, charisma, and beauty. For how this show turned out in the end, I can easily say that the 5th part of the iconic Jojo franchise is one to welcome with open arms.
                              This fifth instalment of JoJo tells, of a group of boys in search of justice and a world that, thanks to them and their heroism, will begin to change for the better. Boys who live, sacrifice themselves, fight against an apparently incontrovertible destiny, bringing with them an resolute spirit, a golden wind that blows away the injustices from the world.
                              I don't even know where to start.
                              I'm a sucker for a good Jojo anime, but this would be the first one I have formally reviewed.
                              TLDR;
                              If I could recommend a show that isn't too long but has a great story with characters that go through hell and back for each other while just deliver just an overall great experience I would recommend Golden Wind.

                              I loved it. By far my favorite Jojo's Bizarre Adventure story yet. 
                              I love JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. It's probably my favorite anime and manga series of all time. This is going to be a biased review written by someone who's loved this story for a long time already. I knew before going into this anime that it would be good. David Production has yet to poorly adapt any of Hirohiko Araki's stellar manga series and Golden Wind is their best work to date. Golden Wind is the best adapted part of JoJo's. It elevates an already amazing story into something truly unforgettable. I loved everything about it.
                              A near perfect action adventure superhero/fantasy anime. The soundtrack is straight up bomb, there is a reason it is used so often in memes and videos. There's no shortage of epic ""cliche"" anime moments that will make u stand up in your seat, and its hella action packed so you won't be bored a minute. The music and action scenes just synergize together so perfectly to create hype and excitement for the audience. Each episode is just bursting with plot twists, explosive moments, confusion, and epic acts of heroism.  The acting is perfect, the music is perfect, and the story while simple is actually          
                              This is one of the best anime's i have ever seen this anime is very creative due to the amount of stands and how each of them have unique abilities and the characters are also very unique besides carne since that dude looks mad weird and pesci but he kinda had his moment so yeah. but Giorno is a very good character in my opinion since he has a dream and he keeps maturing as the story moves on and diavolo is a good villian since he has a very powerful stand and he has very strong motives. The side characters are really good my          
                              Let me just start by saying this was far and away the worst part of jojo yet and I wasn't a huge fan of the first two parts. We’ve reached the end and I still don’t have a good understanding of what the characters goals were. Let’s just jump into the story and get this shit behind us and look forward to Jolyne. 
                              There are a lot of reasons why i love JoJo,
                              The last animated part at the time of this review. Now we leave Japan again to find ourselves in 21st century Italy, with mafias and Stand users loose in the streets. This part takes character development to an extreme, where the protagonist is the entire crew."

And once again, I happened to see another anime movie that same day for half the price (Miss Hokusai), and yet was structured way more like a movie than how Shaft has been handling this ""totally not worth the wait"" prequel, which still baffles me. I know Japan has a different culture to the West, but I'll never understand what it is they love about airing anime episodes in theatres and expecting their audience to pay full price for them. Was this how it was like to          
                              A Kizumonogatari: Nekketsu Review
                              Kizumonogatari  is back once again but this time on the form of Nekketsu-hen or ""Hot Blood"" meant to showcased different aspects of Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade, the Iron Blooded, Hot Blooded yet Cold Blooded Vampire. It brings us the meat of the ""Wound Tale"" novel as it is called by ""Vertical-Inc"" , ""Hot Blood"" maybe I should say it is the backbone that leads us straight into the climax that is yet to approach us on the upcoming January 6th of 2017 for Reiketsu-hen or ""Cold Blood"". However did SHAFT managed the middle installment we've all been waiting for since February  masterfully as they          
                              No spoilers.
                              In anime, there are plenty of cases where the sequel is better than the first season, but does the same hold true with anime movies? In the case of Kizumonogatari, YES!
                              Story:
                              Story-1
                              (7.0/10) 
                              Oh my, yes! I will attempt to make that my only embellishing statement, but no promises. 
                              This... was actually more garbage than the first movie. Wow. 
                              TL;DR: the problem with Kizumonogatari is that it was never a good story to adapt in the first place, and the studio's efforts to turn it into an interesting tale proved fruitless.
                              Part II documents the descent of Araragi into a vampire, since for a long time he is teetering on the edge between humanity. However, it took a rather tedious device involving Hanekawa to bring about this change. Indicative of the Monogatari series, the whole conflict and interest stems from the unlikelihood and contrivance of characteristics. Hanekawa sticks around despite the risk -- perhaps because of the risk. In one scene, she confesses being someone of self-satisfaction instead of self-sacrifice, although it's unclear whether she's being honest. Regardless, the situation could have only occurred due to how perverse both Araragi and Hanekawa actually are, such that          
                              Well what do you have to say about that movie? Holy fucking shit. That was just great, just fucking amazingly great. The cinematography was interesting and on point. The cinematic techniques of choice were critically creative and different. They put animation over intricate art design, or simply using a very interesting choice of art style from mediocre to substantially alluring artwork. And we finally get to see some semantic puns dude lmao. We finally get to see some witty dialogue from the original serie's style of attracting people to watch the anime, for its essence of a great dialogic attraction and ornate philosophical writing. And          
                              As someone who has read through the Kizumonogatari novel multiple times, this film is to me personally is a damn near perfect adaptation.
                              As you enter Nekketsu-hen, the point in the story finally building upon the concepts of humanity and selflessness, where we finally get to the real fight scenes of the movies, it's a little bit hard to shake the feeling that it's constantly, if subtly, off. It's easy to miss the first watch, and if you can brush this feeling aside and enjoy it you'll totally and fully love it anyway. But it feels a bit barebones and skimping on key moments that result in a wobbly progression throughout."
"One autumn evening at a mysterious ramen stand behind the Shimogamo Shrine, a lonely third-year college student bumps into a man with an eggplant-shaped head who calls himself a god of matrimony. Meeting this man causes the student to reflect upon his past two years at college—two years bitterly spent trying to break up couples on campus with his only friend Ozu, a ghoulish-looking man seemingly set on making his life as miserable as possible. Resolving to make the most out of the rest of his college life, the student attempts to ask out the unsociable but kind-hearted underclassman Akashi, yet fails to follow through, prompting him to regret not living out his college life differently. As soon as this thought passes through his head, however, he is hurtled through time and space to the beginning of his years at college and given another chance to live his life.

Surreal, artistic, and mind-bending, Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei chronicles the misadventures of a young man on a journey to make friends, find love, and experience the rose-colored campus life he always dreamed of.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.61,8,64,457,310345,14456,"                              I don't mean to get deep and definitely not right off the bat, but it's pretty true that small events can change the course of your life whether you're aware or not and that is what Yojou-han Shinwa Taikei (or the 4.5 Tatami Mat Galaxy) is all about. Sure it's also about pleasing your Johnny, hijacking blimps, engaging in prank wars, being ripped off by fortune tellers, joining the local power ranger squad, and eating cats and castella, but that's all trivial. Brought to you by the same guy who brought you Mind Game, Cat Soup, and Kaiba, Masaaki Yuasa, brings you what I would          
                              I watched Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei back in 2011. I was a noob and thought it was a masterpiece and the best thing ever. Recently, I rewatched it and came to realize that it was just the wannabe-elitist in me thinking this show is any good. It's basically the same as Sword Art Online, just the other end of the same shit-stick. 
                              Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei (or The Tatami Galaxy) is an anime about a university student stuck in a Groundhog Day-esque time loop. In the span of each episode, our nameless main character (he is referred to as Watashi, basically meaning ""myself"") goes over the same two years of university, unaware of the loop, each time joining a different club, in search of a ""rose-coloured campus life"".
                              I think I'm not in the wrong here when I say most of us have probably thought of the best way to live life at one time or another. That can mean what you want to be when you grow up, your dreams, ambitions, goals, what path you want to take, and what you envision it ending up life.
                              J. D. Salinger's ""The Catcher in the Rye"" despite being a novel intended for adults, in many ways laid the groundworks for the typical young adult story, where an above average intelligent teen tells about their life and problems, in a very self-conscious, humorously wanna-be literate way. Examples range from the now aging Adrian Mole books, to mostly anything by John Green, and the recent British film ""Submarine"". Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei, or Tatami Galaxy, is also a rendition of this trope, though seemingly with a pinch of some hallucinogenic drug.
                              From time to time, I desire a show that will deliver a simple and grounded in reality plot in an unorthodox way with great success. Yes, you should already understand that Tatami Galaxy holds no need for superficial or amazing concepts to be successful, just a realistic story executed in a masterful way.
                              Beware, spoiler-ish review.
                              **SPOILER FREE REVIEW**
                              I decided to watch ""Tatami Galaxy"" because of the overwhelming numbers of positive reviews, many giving it a perfect 10/10.
                              When you look back on your life up until now, do you find yourself feeling somewhat dissatisfied with how things have turned out? Do you find yourself regretting choices you’ve made, the people you’ve met and end up wishing you could just give it another shot, knowing that this time around, everything would work out so much better for you?
                               There isn’t much to Tatami Galaxy. A nameless protagonist, here by referred to as Watashi, wants another chance at a “rose colored campus life with a raven haired maiden”. Through mystical means he is granted the opportunity to do so, thus beginning his journey for that rose colored campus life he so desperately wants though it might just be right in front of him. With such a setup there are not many places to go, and Tatami Galaxy quickly finds itself trapped. 
                              If there was ever a time to slow clap it out, this would be the precise time to.
                              The choices you make might change, but the end result will always be the same.
                              The idea of perfection is something that, I believe, not any piece of media has been able to attain, and that makes sense. Nothing is 'truly perfect' and every piece of media, no matter how great that product actually is, will still have flaws in one way or another and this philosophy also applies when I give tens to shows. When I do so, I don't reward an anime a ten because I believe it is perfect. I reward a ten to an anime that does the most good or is a shining example of what the medium is capable of. The Tatami Galaxy is          
                              ""This opportunity is always dangling in front of your eyes. You must grab this opportunity and act on it. And if you not, you will walk this life as now, ever unchanging."" For starters, the opportunity would be this anime, and you shouldn't miss it, as it will impact your life, just as the quote suggests."
"Natsume Yuujinchou San follows Takashi Natsume, a boy who is able to see youkai. Natsume and his bodyguard Madara, nicknamed Nyanko-sensei, continue on their quest to release youkai from their contracts in the ""Book of Friends.""

Natsume comes to terms with his ability to see youkai and stops thinking of it as a curse. As he spends more time with his human and youkai friends, he realizes how much he values them both and decides he doesn't have to choose between the spirit and human worlds to be happy.

The fourth will be edited in when it finishes, unless it differs heavily from the first three by the end of its run.
                              Although many believe a happy ending is most often times not a ""good ending"" I would beg to differ. In this season, Natsume not only presses towards the future, but shows flashbacks of the past. I was thrilled to see more of Natsume's past because it enabled me to fill some of the mysteries behind his past. 
                              Natsume Yuujinchou’s presentation style is distinctly episodic, meaning that the external conflicts in themselves don’t add up to much. However, there remains a strong undercurrent of Natsume’s character development throughout as he grows from being a lonely boy to a self-assured young man. As such, what makes the viewing experience so worthwhile is the subtle touch of delicate dilemmas and enchanting atmospheres.
                              Natsume Yuujinchou San shows the continuation of Natsume and nyanko sensei's adventures.
                              ""Right now, humans and youkai are equally irreplaceable to me.""
                              If you were to summarize Natsume Yuujinchou San in one word it would be boring. After the first couple of episodes you have basically watched them all as Natsume Yuujinchou San is repetitiveness in its purest form. 
                              Natsume yuujinchou san, the third installment of the beloved series, brings the same lightheartedness and melancholy known throughout the series. 
                              -Kon’nichiwa Mina-san!! Have you already watched Natsume Yuujicnhou by Yuki Midorikawa-sama? This anime will give you a refreshing feeling that is rare to find, some says that you can compare it to Mushishi. Well talking about that is another story.Talking about our main review Natsume Yuujinchou is about the boy named natsume Takashi an adopted child of the childless but kind couple Touku and Shirugen Furijawa and also about the sadness and the longing for someone to understand him despite of his ability to see and communicate with the Ayakashi or Yokai as they said. And as the days go by he started to learn          
                              After waiting two seemingly very long years, a sequel is finally here. Oh! I genuinely miss this series. Though, at the beginning they will explain it a little bit but still you wouldn’t understand it much less appreciates how great this series is if you haven’t seen the previous seasons.
                               this 3rd season of Natsume Yuujinchou i is where I think the series truly begins to Shine, the first two seasons are all about Natsume's enounters with various youkai's as he gives back their name, and learn something new in life.
                              This season finally gave me what I was looking for from this anime, and I'm so happy it did because it was amazing.
                              We continue to view the journey of Takeshi Natsume, an orphaned teenage boy with the ability to communicate with spirits (not dead people?)."
"Still threatened by the ""Titans"" that rob them of their freedom, mankind remains caged inside the two remaining walls. Efforts to eradicate these monsters continue; however, threats arise not only from the Titans beyond the walls, but from the humans within them as well.

After being rescued from the Colossal and Armored Titans, Eren Yaeger devotes himself to improving his Titan form. Krista Lenz struggles to accept the loss of her friend, Captain Levi chooses Eren and his friends to form his new personal squad, and Commander Erwin Smith recovers from his injuries. All seems well for the soldiers, until the government suddenly demands custody of Eren and Krista. The Survey Corps' recent successes have drawn attention, and a familiar face from Levi's past is sent to collect the wanted soldiers. Sought after by the government, Levi and his new squad must evade their adversaries in hopes of keeping Eren and Krista safe.

In Shingeki no Kyojin Season 3, Eren and his fellow soldiers are not only fighting for their survival against the terrifying Titans, but also against the terror of a far more conniving foe: humans.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.6,8,66,43,1247353,15486,"                              In a desolate world where corruption, power, and control rules all, Attack on Titan feels like a story that goes far deeper than just survival. As someone who has been following the series for several years, this franchise has really made a reputation. I’m not even talking about the commercial sales revenue or fan base. I’m talking about how this show evolved from a war between Humans and Titans.
                              Other than the male x male shipping, I am not finding many reasons to like this show anymore.
                              *Minimum Spoiler Review*
                              So, they decided to make a second cour apart. To be honest this is very annoying, we have to wait, but it's okay. It's better than wait for four years.
                              As always this incredible anime has overcome any expectations that people have set for it. The first part of season 3 was amazing, well executed, the sped up pacing (compared to the manga), the visuals and the music were top notch.
                              There are few anime these years that are as bloody and brutal as Attack on Titan is, yet don’t use gore in an overly immature way. Although the series itself has generated much hate and criticism, I still believe it has more depth than most people give credit for. From the very first season, we get to see gruesome events of shock and horror, as well as the point of views of numerous soldiers who had to make sacrifices. It sends a message that shows humanity’s determination and resilience even in hopeless situations. It shows that, even though humans have the capacity for selfishness and          
                              pee-ew stinky poo poo. this season was fucking bad. and i'm not saying this as a hater or anything this shit was BAAAD. // spoilers !!!!
                              There are no spoilers in this review.
                              5s Across the board.... For F--k Sake...
                              Since it is a split cour, time to make a review. I really looked forward for this season of Shingeki no Kyojin. In the trailer, they showed us that Levi is the main focus of this arc. Then on Ep.1, they introduced us (with the best way possible) to Kenny, the ""main villain"" of this arc/season and the one who took care of Levi when he was a kid. The first 2 eps delivered the hype. At that point my rating is a 7/10. They showed what I came for. A Levi centered arc. 
                              I went back and forth on what I should rate this anime and I think I actually gave it a little bit too much credit. Let me start by saying that this is the most overrated anime of all time. Season one was good, season 2 was ok, but season 3 was just...words can't even describe how bad it was. Because of all the hype I decided to watch Attack on Titan, after watching season 1 I really liked the show but it eventually started to feel like your average everyday anime. Mc has some awesome power, gets mad and exposes it to everyone, and          
                               Given the nature of today's media consumption, rarely does anything 'stick' unless constant updates are provided to keep out attention.  Wit Studio's faltering in releasing the second season of AoT has resulted in the series's current lack of attention, which is a shame because it's only gotten better since its first season.  
                              From the mysteries of the second season, now the third season takes the reins with political upheaval along with all those mysteries uncovered and still withstanding in the first and second seasons...with varying degrees of success.
                              By the time this season premiered, I had read and been keeping up with the Attack on Titan manga, so I knew already what to expect while going into this season. Season 3 covers the ""Uprising Arc,"" which is an extremely different turn from what we have normally been seeing in Attack on Titan so far--humans vs. titans. This arc takes on a more political stance and looks at the relationships between humans living in the walls.
                              So, this is the season where everything starts to make sense. All the flaming questions we all had are starting to come together, finally, after more than 30 episodes. Can I just take a moment to appreciate the wonderful suspense this anime has? It wouldn't be the same if they just straight up got into it in the first seasons. And they're even letting space for more - actually, WAY more. The only thing I missed about this part was the fights - but as someone that is now starting the second part, I can tell: there are plenty."
"Yotarou is a former yakuza member fresh out of prison and fixated on just one thing: rather than return to a life of crime, the young man aspires to take to the stage of Rakugo, a traditional Japanese form of comedic storytelling. Inspired during his incarceration by the performance of distinguished practitioner Yakumo Yuurakutei, he sets his mind on meeting the man who changed his life. After hearing Yotarou's desperate appeal for his mentorship, Yakumo is left with no choice but to accept his very first apprentice.

As he eagerly begins his training, Yotarou meets Konatsu, an abrasive young woman who has been under Yakumo's care ever since her beloved father Sukeroku Yuurakutei, another prolific Rakugo performer, passed away. Through her hidden passion, Yotarou is drawn to Sukeroku's unique style of Rakugo despite learning under contrasting techniques. Upon seeing this, old memories and feelings return to Yakumo who reminisces about a much earlier time when he made a promise with his greatest rival.

Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu is a story set in both the past and present, depicting the art of Rakugo, the relationships it creates, and the lives and hearts of those dedicated to keeping the unique form of storytelling alive.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.6,8,67,654,224779,4935,"                              Shouwa Rakugo is a story about life. It is a story about the art of Rakugo, of Japan's history during the Shouwa era, of friendship and family, and of sacrificing everything to reach one's potential, but particularly it is a story about life— the lives of two talented, troubled and yet ordinary men. 
                              When I sat down to write this review I had a hard time condensing my feelings towards it into written format. This wasn't to say the story was complex; on the contrary, it was rather straightforward on paper. But when I tried to articulate my thoughts to virtual ink, nothing came to fruition. Then after I sat back and let everything that had transpired sink in, it just hit me, a simple word, yet one that was able to properly express the feelings that I had wadded up inside for this title. Simply put, Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu was poetic. 
                              It is truly fascinating of what people are capable of doing to survive in society, especially when you are basically abandoned by your relatives. A young boy who once aspired to be a dancer has no choice but to learn the art of Rakugo, a form of Japanese verbal entertainment in which the storyteller sits on stage while performing a complicated comedical story. Audiences may have had the impression that it solely focuses on the profession, yet this is not the case. At first it seems that it simply served as means of survival, but it becomes apparent that the journey throughout his life was          
                              If you have ever watched stand up comedy or listened to NPR ( This American Life, Fresh Air with Terry Gross, A Prairie Home Companion from Lake Wobegone), you should check this anime out. If not, it's slow, mediocre, and overrated. The reason why it's rated so high is that it's one of those "" at least it doesn't take place in high school"" anime shows. 
                              Overview: 
                              Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu. I have to admit, this show took me by storm. A series about rakugo isn’t something that we see often in the anime industry these days in particular dealing with performances on stage. As such, this series is what I like to describe as a dark horse. And for a lot of reasons, it deserves quite a lot of praise for what is.
                              *Despite both the title, and the first episode spoiling the show in heavy detail, there is so much here to unwind, that I cannot bear not giving you the classic SPOILER warning. Please, watch the show if you haven't; I implore you to do so. For those who have (or those who don't care about spoilers), let's move on*
                              (This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site)
                              Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu has been hyped to me as the best anime of this year. Mature historical drama with amazing voice acting and editing. 
                              A diamond in the rough, that’s for sure. Who could have thought that a show dedicated to the art of sitting down and telling a story could be so engaging? Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu has blown me away with its ability to create a thoroughly fleshed-out cast, packed to the brim with personality. I hung on to every word that was said, and in a show revolving heavily around dialogue, that would be critical to helping the anime hit the mark. The performances are always entertaining but always serve that dual purpose of opening up a window into our characters’ lives and their troubles. This          
                              Rakugo. Essentially, the art of storytelling. But through the course of these 13 episodes, we discover there is so much more to this ancient Japanese art-form. There is great attention to technique, pacing, the teller's voice, the genre of story and so on. What SGRS does is transport us to a time when this beautiful yet under appreciated art-form is stagnant and slowly dying, due to other emerging entertainments such as television. Yet also the stubbornness and pride of the elder Rakugo masters to stick to old traditions and their disdain for anything new and different. 
                              Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu is a historical Josei manga written by Kumota Haruko that began in 2010. Just this year, an anime adaptation aired, being brought to us by Studio Deen. You may recall them as the studio behind Read or Die, Gravitation, The law of Ueki, & Sakura Trick. Just to name some of their series I've looked at. How does this historical drama compare? Let's take a look and see.
                              Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu was definitely not an extremely popular show when it aired. And yet, after a few different sources said that this show was different, but definitely worth watching, I tried it out. And the result was an amazing, sorely underrated show that is incomparable to anything else.
                              To be excellent, an anime doesn't always need to be endowed with great ideas. It doesn't always have to explore overwhelming themes. It doesn't need to have deeper meaning. Sometimes, subtlety and proper execution of everything it does is sufficient to make a masterful series. Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu is such an anime.
                              Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu is the story of two men trying to preserve what they love and themselves in an era where the world around them is constantly evolving. Bon, a boy confronted with the lack of attributes corresponding to his role in society, failed in a path of implausible success in the feminine arts after a lifelong injury and finally abandoned by a cold-hearted mother because of it, pursues in rakugo a cure for the scars of his past. Shin, an orphan raised by the remains of a fallen, forgotten legend, seeks for a change in rakugo alongside the new winds of post-war Japan          "

Meanwhile, fellow Kamogawa Gym mate Aoki Masaru is just a hop, skip, and a Frog Punch away from claiming his own belt, ready to take on the Japanese Lightweight Champion!

Hajime no Ippo: Rising continues Ippo's quest to become stronger, featuring the same cast of loveable dimwits from Kamogawa Gym, as they put their bodies and hearts on the line to make their way in the harsh world of professional boxing. With a will of iron, Ippo steps into the ring once again.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.6,8,69,853,176676,1018,"                              Taking place where New Challenger leaves off, the series starts from Ippo vs Shimabukuro Iwao to the conclusion of the story of Kamogawa in his youth in Post World War II Japan. Naturally, a new anime installment of Hajime no Ippo did excite me. I mean, with New Challenger ending, the animators have nearly 60 volumes to catch up on as opposed to being 60 volumes ahead unlike a certain Studio Pierrot series which you can easily conclude is. 
                              Intro:
                              First of all a big thanks to George Morikawa because he did something nearly impossible with Hajime no Ippo. He managed to keep his story interesting and his comedy fresh even after all these years. Sure it has it’s weaknesses(for example some short chapters in the manga plus some repeated stuff in the story etc) but it is still a great accomplishment that only a few are capable of.
                              I think I just wrote review for this season in a panel made for Hajime No Ippo: new Challenger 
                              I'm a huge Hajime no Ippo fan, I love the anime and manga, so when I heard of this latest season coming out I was excited because some of my favourite fights from the manga were going to be animated. 
                              I watched this straight after New Challenger, and it blew me away just as much.
                              This anime is by far my #1 favorite. In this review I will not just be reviewing Rising, but the entirety of the anime seasons (Hajime No Ippo, New Challenger, and Rising). The movies themselves are good, but will not be included here.
                              Please note before continuing I reference my reviews on the previous installments of Hajime no Ippo a little bit in this review so you might be a little lost if you haven't read the first two."

                              Once again Ufotable x Type-Moon did not disappoint. Watching it in the cinema (in Japan) with proper loudspeakers can enable me to experience the thrill of this fantastic display of animation choreography. The amount of time and effort by Ufotable once again demonstrates its class in perfecting high-quality animation and its visual arts. The unlimited budget work studio took time off from anime series and dedicate all their resources into this project and came out in fruition, and I could not be prouder for them. 
                              ""I'm not a virgin. My first time was quite a long time ago. That's not all. Ever since that first time, my body has been touched by unnatural things. I don't deserve to be protected by you!""
                              Lost Butterfly is a nightmare. A violent, corrosive nightmare. Gone is the dread that Presage Flower bathed in, as terror strikes in its place. The Holy Grail War is no longer just contaminated, it's corrupted. All that's left to do is watch the fireworks as everything goes to hell.
                                   Heaven's Feel: Lost Butterfly does a great deal to improve upon Presage Flower and feels like a breathe of fresh air for the Fate/Stay Night franchise. While Presage Flower had to retread some of the ground Unlimited Blade Works and Fate laid, this new film does a lot to show you what is new this time around and the much more intense and dark direction the series takes.
                              Spoilers if you did not read the original 2004 visual novel nor the realta nua version
                              I just saw this movie in theaters less than an hour ago. So I may come back and edited this review after I've seen a second time. (If I've seen it a second time.)
                              Some minor spoilers. But if you're reading this you pretty know what largely happens in the film.
                              ""The bigger they are, the harder they fall"". This statement hold true to almost everything. And with various of recently poor alternative version, Fate! franchise is clearly not an exception. It seems like the greatness of Fate/Zero and the entertaining Fate UBW has forever faded in the shadow of doubts. But fortunately, this time, ufotable has learnt their lessons. Coming back to its root or in this case - route, fan of Fate! finally rejoice. Today, let's look at the 2nd installment of the highly acclaim action fantasy movie: Heaven's Fell part 2 - Lost Butterfly.
                              *Spoiler-free review*
                              *SPOILERS AHEAD.*
                              I will start this review by stating I will avoid major plot spoilers and discuss the events vaguely as to not spoil anything but will discuss character developments;
                              Sempai, Sempai, Sempai? UmU.

"As the Fourth Holy Grail War rages on with no clear victor in sight, the remaining Servants and their Masters are called upon by Church supervisor Risei Kotomine, in order to band together and confront an impending threat that could unravel the Grail War and bring about the destruction of Fuyuki City. The uneasy truce soon collapses as Masters demonstrate that they will do anything in their power, no matter how despicable, to win.

Seeds of doubt are sown between Kiritsugu Emiya and Saber, his Servant, as their conflicting ideologies on heroism and chivalry clash. Meanwhile, an ominous bond forms between Kirei Kotomine, who still seeks to find his purpose in life, and one of the remaining Servants. As the countdown to the end of the war reaches zero, the cost of winning begins to blur the line between victory and defeat.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.59,8,72,105,815876,17375,"                              From the mind that gave us works such as Madoka and Saya no Uta comes a tale spun as a predecessor to the wildly popular series Fate/Stay Night. Of course, anyone who has read or watched Fate/Stay Night knows the outcome of the fourth Holy Grail War, but only half the fun of a journey is the destination. Gen Urobuchi and studio Ufotable guide us through a magnificent world saturated with dynamic characters, a beautiful score, jaw-dropping visuals and fluctuating idealistic views, which all congeal into a compelling narrative. Mistakes are made by Ufotable, but compared to the grandiose story and execution they only serve

                              The Holy Grail War: A war fought between seven selected masters and their servants to determine a sole victor, who will then bless one miracle upon the world. The Holy Grail War can either bring about an ideal wish that saves innocent lives or lead to chaotic destruction in the process. Or both. The Fate Zero series' plot circles around the Holy Grail War, its history and its future. The previous season focused on the characters' backgrounds, and in this season it is now all-out war. 
                              For a show that heavily relies on dialogue, it sure was lacking in the quality of dialogue. I often found myself bored with whatever they were talking about, mainly because the plot was boring and all the characters had many unappealing traits which made me not care about them. 
                              This review considers the anime adaptation of Fate Zero (F/Z) Season 2 entirely on its own merit.
                              For the love of Holy Grail, if you have never watched anything from Fate/Stay Night franchise under any circumstances DO NOT watch Fate/Zero first! I'll hold an even stronger statement - don't watch it at all. I've just made this grievous mistake, because I had listened to advice given on youtube by several self-proclaimed anime gurus. And now how pissed I am! Sheesh! Firstly, it ruined much of the experience of Fate/Stay Night. And secondly, I strongly believe Fate/Zero is crap.
                              Fate Zero 2nd Season review:
                              This review analyzes the entirety of Fate/Zero, not secluded to one seasoned release. Firstly, Fate/Zero is a prequel to the stories of ""Fate/stay night"". ""Fate/stay night"" originated as a visual novel and later was released as an anime in 2006. That anime, while it does succeed in some ways to its own right, is something that should be taken as its own entity as it can be considered a failure of being an accurate adaptation of the source material. The visual novel itself comprised of three stories that all are tied to this one. Two of those are currently being brought up in anime-form by          
                              Fate/Zero was entertaining at times, with several very good fight sequences and the nice animation, but it doesn't make up for the real lack of any sort of coherent story or character development. Fate/Zero has simple plot hiding behind rhetoric and long-winded speeches from rooftops just to look cool. The dialogue was uninspired at best and often times so dull that I felt that I could walk away to make a cup of coffee and come back knowing I missed absolutely nothing that contributed to the story.
                              Tyrannical power and glory are two things that define a sovereign ruler with an iron fist. Many mythologies have been interpreted to fit these notions into their stories to create a different understanding of them. A series that has been long regarded with acclaim by many die-hard enthusiasts is the Fate series. Starting as a visual novel series, it eventually shifted its form to animation with Fate Stay Night to mediocre reception from fans. It was then that a man named Gen Urobuchi decided to make a prequel light novel series called Fate Zero, and thus a legendary phenomenon was born in animation form four

                              If I had to be fair to the greatness of this serie, I had to drop the rate of all the animes I've rated until now by 2 points or more.

"On the surface, the thought of Kyouko Hori and Izumi Miyamura getting along would be the last thing in people's minds. After all, Hori has a perfect combination of beauty and brains, while Miyamura appears meek and distant to his fellow classmates. However, a fateful meeting between the two lays both of their hidden selves bare. Even though she is popular at school, Hori has little time to socialize with her friends due to housework. On the other hand, Miyamura lives under the noses of his peers, his body bearing secret tattoos and piercings that make him look like a gentle delinquent.

Having opposite personalities yet sharing odd similarities, the two quickly become friends and often spend time together in Hori's home. As they both emerge from their shells, they share with each other a side of themselves concealed from the outside world.

                              Anime touting a gimmick always worry me. They throw in these attention grabbers in an attempt to say ""Hey look! I boast something different than those other shows of the same genre and concept as me, come and watch!"" But they often end up being entirely one dimensional because they solely revovolve around that one singular idea. Then the author realizes that they actually need more than a unique shtick to write a story and fail to craft an engaging narrative filled with expressive characters to support it. Whoops!

                              KareKano is a 1995 shoujo manga with a 1998 anime adaptation directed by Hideaki Anno.
                              A show containing the typical elements you would find in most Shoujo: the bishounen tropes where guys are drawn prettier than girls, colorful sparkling backgrounds for short scenes that are supposed to be cute and a school romance atmosphere intended to make the heart of teen girls go dokidoki depicting the usual (unrealistic) fantasies girls have around that age:
                              Normally don't watch a lot of romance animes, or don't have a major interest in them. But this show is far different for me. To the point I'm for sure am gonna read the manga afterwards because of how great I find it. It's one of the best of the season, and let me explain why.
                              This show is the definition of mid.
                              My review contains spoilers, so read at your own risk.
                              Overall: 7/10
                              I’ve been hearing about Horimiya manga for a while, yet it hasn’t caught my attention at all, then the anime aired, so I watched a couple of episodes out of pure curiosity, and it managed to totally and completely catch my attention.
                              Reducing my rating from 5 to 3 after the last episode.
                              When watching Horimiya one question constantly grazes through my head; if only. If only they had given ANY time for character development and backstory before making the relationship progress rapidly in minutes, maybe then I could actually care about the characters. It's laughable that the premise is *oh my god this girl and boy who look a certain way at school actually have completely different personalities!* - why is it laughable? The premise is done and explored within the first 4 minutes of episode one. It doesn't even give the viewer time to fully grasp the preconceived self of the mc's, no it does not.          
                              WARNING!! this contains some references to the manga but no spoilers pass episode 4, i only reference chapters that were skipped in the 4 episodes.
                              Every so often there comes a story that is truly groundbreaking, it goes a direction no one had ever thought to go before and changes the anime landscape forever. Horimiya...isn't that, the premise is extremely basic; the loner guy and the popular girl find out they have more in common than they thought. He was a boy, she was a girl, can I make it any more obvious? How about if I literally name the story after their ship name?
                              I loved the manga so I'm glad that the anime is keeping up with the expectations! I'm really happy with the casting, all the voices fit the characters so well!"
"The aloof protagonist: a bookworm who is deeply detached from the world he resides in. He has no interest in others and is firmly convinced that nobody has any interest in him either. His story begins when he stumbles across a handwritten book, titled ""Living with Dying."" He soon identifies it as a secret diary belonging to his popular, bubbly classmate Sakura Yamauchi. She then confides in him about the pancreatic disease she is suffering from and that her time left is finite. Only her family knows about her terminal illness; not even her best friends are aware. Despite this revelation, he shows zero sympathy for her plight, but caught in the waves of Sakura's persistent buoyancy, he eventually concedes to accompanying her for her remaining days.

As the pair of polar opposites interact, their connection strengthens, interweaving through their choices made with each passing day. Her apparent nonchalance and unpredictability disrupts the protagonist's impassive flow of life, gradually opening his heart as he discovers and embraces the true meaning of living.

I loved this movie, and I cried my eyes out. The reason people love tearjerkers is because people want to be moved. We want to experience something that will truly take us away from our lives and make us feel something so strong that we are moved to tears. This movie did just that. In an effort to avoid spoiling anything for anyone, I won’t write about the climax and ending, but it was unexpected. That said, I couldn’t imagine it ending any

                              ""I Want to Eat Your Pancreas"" is one of the worst excuses for a movie I have ever seen! 
                              Kimi no Suizou wo Tabetai, also known by the English title ""I want to eat your pancreas"", is a drama anime film with tragedy. It is about an outgoing girl who has a pancreatic illness which she has not told anyone except her family that she has this illness. A boy from her class stumbles upon her diary that she left in the hospital and she comes back to fetch the diary only to realise that he read it so she ends up telling him about her illness. Due to this secret knowledge of theirs that none of their classmates know about, they start to          
                              See you can make a memorable modern movie if you want too Japan! Made by a studio who nobody even heard about it ""I want to eat your pancreas"" is a rare gem that everyone must see! Like Frank Sinatra's song ""Strangers in the Night"" I too was a stranger before coming across this movie. This movie is a letter of love addressed to life who despite being short is damn gorgeous!
                              I enjoy clichéd, predictable tearjerkers as much as the next person (honestly, I do), but not like this. Kimi no Suizou wo Tabetai chooses to explore how we live out our relationships with others in the face of death, and does so by presenting a questionable relationship in the first place.
                              I have never given my opinion about anything in MAL. But honestly, I had to make an exception here.
                              This review vaguely goes over themes discussed at later points in the film. Read with caution.
                              I decided to watch this Movie in the split second that nearly made me miss the last bus that would make me arrive at the cinema on time. 
                              What will you do if you know that you are going to die in one year? Of course, most people definitely want to live their life to the fullest, fulfilling anything they want, going to places that is impossible to go, or maybe devoting themselves to a spiritual journey in the name of God. This anime film definitely will reminded you of death that eventually come to us whether you like it or not, how you should leave your mark in this world and how it could change other person to a better one. Having the most misleading title I have ever heard, I Want          
                              This Is my first time writing a review. 
                              I've gotta say just one thing to start off with, watch this. sit down, don't get distracted, don't stop/pause it in the middle for a bathroom/popcorn/snack/smartphone break... pick some time where you WON'T be interrupted what so ever. this movie is excellent. I've no clue what the novel or it's manga is like; but as a stand alone movie this one SERIOUSLY ties my #1 choices up in knots. 'Kimi no Na wa.' WAS my singular #1 anime movie ever. but now I think I've got two. 
                              Terrible.
                              I recently watched this and toward the end, I felt strongly about how *bad* it got near the end and had to write my thoughts down about it. But before I begin..."
Season 5 of Natsume Yuujinchou.,8.59,8,75,1096,136498,697,"                              I love how each episode they show us the youkai's, natori, Touko and Shigeru's backstory very very heart warming. Some episode manage to make me touched with every single character they have and made me care for them like what happend to them after that? how are they doing now? is Natsume going to be straight or gay? Taki or someone?
                              It's Natsume Yuujinchou. If you aren't following this series, you've either not tried it or slice of life anime is just not for you. That's okay if you don't like slower shows. Otherwise... Join us in the iyashikei world, where the world is good and pureness reigns and smiles are protected! Go! We'll see you at Roku!
                              The fifth season of Natsume Yuujinchou was a true pleasure to watch. In this season, we see Natsume's friendships develop and grow. We learn more about his troubled past and the backstory behind the Fujiwaras. 
                              It is more of the same thing that was in previous seasons: A somewhat melancholic, calm slice of life kind of show that deals with supernatural elements. If you watched and liked previous seasons, you'll like this one as well.
                              I almost went into labor when I knew that Natsume Yuujinchou got a new season. And ooommmggg, it were four long years of waiting, goddammit! I thought they had canceled the animation projects, but then this came out and I became extremely happy to continue watching the adaptation of one of the best Shoujo manga (if not THE best) that exists in the manga market. Geez, I don't know if I'm able to tell in this review how much excited and sincerely pleased I'm right now. Finally!
                              Alright, so the longer I watch this anime, the harder it is to review. Here's the thing about this anime: it grows on you. The things that I would've wanted to be changed before, I don't want them to be changed anymore. 
                              I'm so happy to see a new season of Natsume Yuujinchou, I thought it would not going to happen. It is, no doubt, my favorite anime. Good story, great characters, with a calm e heartwarming atmosphere. Some episodes will make you laugh, some episodes will make you cry, but most of them will make you calm. My heart  fills with happiness everytime I watch Natsume Yuujinchou."
"Onto their third serialization, manga duo Moritaka Mashiro and Akito Takagi—also known by their pen name, Muto Ashirogi—are ever closer to their dream of an anime adaption. However, the real challenge is only just beginning: if they are unable to compete with the artist Eiji Niizuma in the rankings within the span of six months, they will be canceled. To top it off, numerous rivals are close behind and declaring war. They don't even have enough time to spare thinking about an anime!

Whether it's getting securing your ideal job, marrying someone you always admired, or becoming a superstar, dreams require many ingredients to make it come true. It requires hard work, determination, motivation, creativity, and even a little luck. Yet, when people follows these dreams, it can be surprising on how much they realize about their goal and about themselves. In Bakuman 3, the series follows two best friends who hopes to achieve their dreams and become professional manga artists.
                              Bakuman 3 is a great continuation of the series. I enjoyed watching it and I can definitely say that it will be worth your time as well. Here's the review.
                              Let's get things straight - this series is amazingly good. I want you to have that in mind as you read on since I would like to write about all 3 seasons and not just this one - I would like to sum up my experiences with the entire package.

I think  it was the best season of all 3 , the quality of the art was a little better , the drama and the romance was more intense than the other 2 seasons , but what I really enjoyed in this one was the work of "" Ashirogi Moto "" and the great challenges between theme and Niizuma , it was both exciting and enjoyable to watch . I definitely think the serie of bakuman was one of best series I've watched so far , simply because of the unique story and the nice touch of comedy that          
                              Out of 100 Nobles watching…
                              #This is my first review =)
                              This is a *Spoiler* Free review. So you don't have pay me. Just kidding.
                              This is not a review only of Bakuman 3 but of all seasons so far.
                              Bakuman was originally a manga which got turned into an anime which is about the main characters trying to get it big in the manga industry in order to get an anime to fulfill their dreams.
                              This anime is about the love story of Mashiro and Azuki in a unique way, even though they work apart in a very far place to each other, they still got in contact  and will married after Mashiro gets an anime and Azuki was able to voice act in Mashiro's anime. Mashiro works together with Takagi, Takagi being the writer and Mashiro being the drawer. Mahiro has an uncle who died of working too hard, his uncle had teaches Mashiro so many things about being a Mangaka. Both Takagi and Mashiro work together in the title of Ashirogi Muto, Ashirogi Muto had a really          
                              Bakuman is all about following your dream in life, how you should never give up and instead continue to strife to reach your goal no matter what. 
                              To find a friend who shares the same passion, to be able to marry your crush when the dream that you share with her becomes true, to have supporting family, rivals with same goal that keep motivating each other, ones that guide you to your path and to chase the dream of life. Bakuman has been one hell of a ride.
                              It's been a long journey since the first season of Bakuman. It is such an amazing story, everyone has to watch it! 
                              BAKUMAN IN GENERAL: a perfect anime does not need to be explained in so many words said that this masterpiece showing pure reality of the life of a mangaka , I recommend it for those who have time in the world of anime , and can appreciate art and reality in this anime , someone who is not totally immersed in the world of anime could not give full appreciation of this anime and see him leaving would end before finding that this anime is considered a work of art"
"From unraveling the secrets of opening and closing doors to defusing surprise packages more commonly known as bombs, there is never a dull day at the Hololive Production office! Holo no Graffiti follows an eccentric cast of Virtual YouTubers, also known as ""VTubers,"" going about their absurd yet hilarious daily lives, detailing all their cute moments and mishaps.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.58,8,77,3815,18251,1067,"                              I think there's a new potential #1 on MAL. Having been watching anime for many years, I can successfully conclude that this is my second ever 10/10 anime I've ever seen.
                              I think Holo no Graffiti is an exquisite work of art. Every episode, it shows how unconventional that makes you think ""wow that sure is weird huh"" but in actuality it depicts life as it is. No aspects of life are truly conventional, in fact every weird thing that happens in our lifetime happens because the Greater Being grants us the cruel punishment that is life. Another interesting design choice that ""Holo no Graffiti"" shows is the rapid, moving dialogues and animation that is present in most of its episodes. Rather than being done for the sake of comedy, it is actually a reflection of          
                              The anime industry has a long and rich history filled with series, shorts and movies that mark generations and it’s audience in a particular time period. Suchs works were produced thanks to numerous creative minds that were passionate about animation and wanted to be a part of the creative process behind such works.
                              Alright, so, just to preface, this review is coming from someone who hasn't really watched much hololive stuff. I've seen a few clips here and there on YouTube (As most of us have at this point, it's inescapable.) but I haven't exactly dedicated any time to watching full streams or remembering many of the members' names. With that out of the way, here's my review of what I've seen of this little anime.
                              What the fuck is going on? Am I missing a joke? Why is this stuff rated so highly out of nowhere? I have no idea what I just witnissed, I actually want to believe it's all fake.
                              The best work of the aniem of the history, each chapter is a unique experience in which the problems of our current society are explored with good exposition. All the characters have development arcs, good characterization and all are endearing, despite this I feel that the ones that stand out the most are Okayu for his revenge and redemption arc, I also highlight Korone despite his tragic past he manages to walk again thanks to the corpse of the holy body and to Watame who at first did not want to get on the Eva but thanks to her companions she manages to overcome the          
                              While as Hololive (JP, ID, EN included; CN Star excluded) is eventually invincible, Nijisanji should be thrown into the trashtank of VTB history.
                              Ok, so I'm not exactly a fan of Hololive; Not that I have anything against it or v-tubers in general, I just never got into it. I have a vague understanding of some of the more popular characters from memes and stream clips, but I've never sat through one of their streams. I do, however, have an Hololive-obsessed friend who showed me a few of these and now that this show has been added to MAL I am bound by the competitionest's curse to see this through to the very end.  
                              I don't review anime but here, I need to do it.
                              I´ve seen a lot of series, but specifically this one is such an amazing work, i really can't believe how this is that good, every time i see a episode from Holo no Graffiti there is a smile in my face  that I can't get rid of, all the episodes are just as good, all  the characters are so deep that they even have their own  Youtube's channels, is that good that a whole life wouldn't be enough to watch all the content that hololive has to offer.

                              So Holo Graffiti. You have seen this. In Pingu in the City, those perverted reviewers and so on. It's the rate 10 anime 'cause its fun. Why? Doesn't matter, everyone is doing it. Are we sheep just having a dream? And if so, should I want to wake up?

"As the war temporarily calms down and Edo rebuilds, Gintoki finds Shinpachi—who is still unaware of his return—on a bridge. However, as a fight quickly breaks out between the Yorozuya and the Tenshouin Naraku, suspicion grows, forcing Gintoki to use what is nearest—a loincloth—to mask his identity. Saved for the time being, Gintoki enters the Yorozuya office, but unbeknownst to him, someone else is already waiting there...

After boarding the Gorilla Amanto mother ship, he realizes that he doesn't speak their language. Confused, Kondou tries conversing with them, only to inadvertently gain their support.

                              In case fans of Gintama want to know what The Semi-Final is, it basically adapts a few chapters that took place between episode 367 and The Final that weren't gonna fit/didn't blend well with the story in the final film. It's a direct pickup from episode 367, so it does feel a bit weird to watch these two episodes, but it probably would feel nicer to watch if you watch this right after episode 367."
"Once called a fallen powerhouse and known as ""Flightless Crows,"" Karasuno High School has finally taken flight at nationals. With a comprehensive performance against Tsubakihara Academy in their first match, the team is now facing its toughest opponent yet: the runners-up of the last Spring Tournament, Inarizaki High School. Furthermore, dealing with the formidable twin Miya brothers only makes things more difficult for Karasuno.

As soon as the match begins, Karasuno is overwhelmed by all the noise and jeers from the supporters of Inarizaki High but rekindles its strength thanks to its own loyal fans. Karasuno also gains some momentum by utilizing an attack centered on Shouyou Hinata, but the eccentric play of Atsumu and Osamu Miya delivers an unexpected blow that leaves their opponent astounded.

Things are bound to get intense as the match progresses between these two teams. Will Karasuno be able to defeat Inarizaki High and overcome the hurdles that threaten its pursuit to the top?

                              Haikyuu is one of my favourite anime, but this will not be a review that contains fangirling. Will contain scene mentions, proceed carefully.
                              Short and sweet. Overall being a Haikyuu Stan, I give this an 8/10, mainly since the second half carried this season.

                              Haikyuu, one of the best sports anime ever, and a personal favorite of mine, being an athlete myself. Im a swimmer, so youd think I would be able to relate to Free! more than Haikyuu. Nope. Haikyuu is every bit as relateable and motivational for me as a swimmer than free couldve been. Which is why i favor haikyuu over free. Now without further ado, lets get into my review.
                              Story : outstanding!! the storyline is just AMAZING, it's very inspirational, funny, cheerfull, and emotional. boring and overused? NAH original? ABSOLUTELY YES
                              My fav anime of all time. I'm so glad that I am alive to watch this anime I mean it's jst a masterpiece 🥺 and I'm so proud of hinata. My baby have improved so much and I can't wait to see the next season (karasuno vs nekoma). Also I hope they animate msby black jackals match too. 
                              Haikyuu!! To The Top 2nd season did not disappoint. It was real Haikyuu. And Haikyuu is absolutely incredible.
                              I mean, I knew what was gonna happen, but it was funny and awesome anyway.
                              To The Top season 1 was already pretty bad, but I held out knowing that season 2 would have more volleyball. Then To the Top season 2 came out... utterly gormless. It pains me to say, as someone who really enjoyed the whole series up until To the Top, but what little enjoyment I got was from laughing at it and laughing at how bad it was. Personally, the two main issues were the story/characters and the art. "
"The entire countryside comes to a halt midday to witness a rare solar eclipse that is rumored to allow the average person to see Mushi. Unable to avert their gaze, the air is full of awe and wonder—but those who know the Mushi are preparing for the eclipse's aftermath.

Based on a prediction from Tanyuu Karibusa, the cursed recorder, Mushishi Ginko finds himself in a very unlucky farming village. Immediately following the solar eclipse, a strange black cloud begins to gather in the sky and blocks the sun once more. Suspecting it to be the work of a Mushi known as Hihami, Ginko seeks to liberate the village from perpetual darkness. However, it seems that not all of the villagers are eager to return to the light.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.57,8,79,1343,106062,173,"                              Do not take anything for granted, not even life itself. This simple yet profound message is splendidly conveyed by another episode of the calming drug called ""Mushishi"". What an adventure this series has been; watching Ginko investigating various mushi species in a clever but always comprehensible way, not only curing every human in need of help whatever their origin, but also depicting the essence of life.
                              2006 marks the last airing of Mushishi, a small journey within a rural Shinto-inspired Japan. It is, in essence, about harmony—emanating the struggle for humans to find balance in their lives and to attain kiyome (""purity"") among the cycles of nature. Prospects of a sequel have been teased for a while now, and as time passed, hopeful fans were beginning to lose faith. Now, 8 years later, studio Artland and director Hiroshi Nagahama relaunch the series with a one hour-long Mushishi episode, entitled ""Hihamukage"" (""Sun-Eating Shade"").
                              Watching Mushishi is not just a mystifying experience but one that you will remember by for its atmosphere of exquisite presentation. Through understanding, Mushishi presents problems but also solutions in which main protagonist Ginko solves throughout his journey. As a journeyman, Ginko takes on the road once again in this special OVA that chronicles his expedition.
                              There's a perpetual sense of wisdom that can be attributed to the series called Mushishi. Each story is unique and offers a diverse spectrum of intricate stories. These stories often portray something similar to life lessons and are beautiful representations of teaching tolerance through a creative medium of animation. Despite this feeling of attaining an essence of enlightenment and understanding, it's also quite difficult to express what the actual lessons are that you've learned. That's the beauty of Mushishi.
                              Let me first remind you what I thought of the TV series. I adored it. The subtle storyline, the calming feeling, the idea of small creatures that are mostly misunderstood taking roles in peoples lives. I love everything about it. It doesn’t go as surprising then that I really love this special then, right? It just felt like a long episode from the TV series. The storyline and soft music was a perfect match to it.
                              The new special was a shock to us all. Mushishi is, well let’s be blunt, an older series – and being “old” (returning after almost nine years have passed) it has all the charms of seeing an old friend after a long time. Or falling into your bed after being away from home a long time. The world is nebulous, the time frame uncertain, but it is unquestionable blend of Japanese folktales, pre-industrialization Japan and modern world technology. Like the word itself, viewers can suspend belief when it comes to the supernatural mushi. And that belief has a kind of subtle magic. For fans, the          
                              Alright, here we go. This'll be a short one, but let's talk about this special episode of Mushishi. 
                              Now I loved mushishi.I thought it was clever,emotional,beautiful and philosophical all at the same time. This series came out in 2005 and now that in 2014 a special and a second season were announced I was very excited. It took me a while to get to but I am finally starting my crusade to watch all of the fairly new mushishi content we have been presented with.But enough of my rambling now onto the review.Mushishi Special: Hihamukage is a 45 minute special and is the kickstart to the slew of mushishi content to grace us in 2014. So what makes this special so amazing? Well          
                              Mushishi Special: Hihamukage is the continuation of the the original series of Mushishi, serving as an interlude between the original and later seasons. "
"The seemingly ordinary and unimpressive Saitama has a rather unique hobby: being a hero. In order to pursue his childhood dream, he trained relentlessly for three years—and lost all of his hair in the process. Now, Saitama is incredibly powerful, so much so that no enemy is able to defeat him in battle. In fact, all it takes to defeat evildoers with just one punch has led to an unexpected problem—he is no longer able to enjoy the thrill of battling and has become quite bored.

This all changes with the arrival of Genos, a 19-year-old cyborg, who wishes to be Saitama's disciple after seeing what he is capable of. Genos proposes that the two join the Hero Association in order to become certified heroes that will be recognized for their positive contributions to society, and Saitama, shocked that no one knows who he is, quickly agrees. And thus begins the story of One Punch Man, an action-comedy that follows an eccentric individual who longs to fight strong enemies that can hopefully give him the excitement he once felt and just maybe, he'll become popular in the process.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.57,8,80,5,2144141,54772,"                              This is a complete review after watching all 12 episodes of One Punch Man.
                              There are only two types of people in the world: one who absolutely love One Punch Man, and other who strongly dislike it for being too predictable. Now finally that the anime is over, I can review it properly. 
                              When it comes to satires and parodies alike, there really isn't any sort of arithmetic equation or analytical evaluation needed to determine its value. To put it as simply, it all boils down to a rudimentary question: were you kept amused and were you entertained? 
                              One-Punch Man is pretty much exactly like what it sounds. We got a bald guy named Saitama who literally beats his opponents with a single punch. He is so powerful that throughout his life, he gets bored with the opponent he fights with. Because when a guy like him can beat up opponents with just one punch, it doesn’t get very fun right? Regardless, Saitama has a heart of gold and in this series, we follow his daily adventures as a hero, as the man who one punches his enemies.
                              After finishing this show I have concluded that it certainly lives up to its name. Oh no no, not the majority opinion of it, silly goose, I mean the actual show title, “One Punch Man,” because this show genuinely does only have ONE joke, and it gets old very, very fast.
                              One Punch Man is a comedy/parody shounen anime. Unfortunately it fails as a parody and it fails as a shounen.
                              Story: 5 (so-so only)
                              Goddamn, last season was heavy on the shonen/superhero stuff, wasn't it? Seraph of the End: Battle in Nagoya. Ushio and Tora. Noragami Aragoto. And of course, the most popular one of them all, One Punch Man. It's going to be difficult to find something new to say about each of them, but lord knows I'm going to try my damndest to do so. Might as well start with the one that got everyone's attention, even if not for all the right reasons. I mean it's a giant understatement to say that I wasn't the only one who watched One Punch Man, but it's also a          
                              With One-Punch Man finished airing, there is one thing anyone can agree on, and that is how split the community is about the show: there are people who absolutely love it, considering it the pinnacle of their experience, and others that consider it to be very bland and boring, with terrible humour. Now the question is whether these opinions on the show are justified or not, and naturally it is, on both sides. Is One-Punch Man overrated? Yes, it is. But is it mediocre, bad? No, in my opinion it is not, it's an enjoyable anime with fantastic animation and action.
                              Every year there is at least one particular show that receives massive coverage for whatever reason.In 2015, without a question was One Punch Man's year in the spotlight and for good reason; the initial premise of One Punch seemed to be a goldmine, for it was thought to be a clever,satiristic view of the shonen and action anime that has been dominate since the last decade. 
                              Jesus christ, calm the fuck down. It's a pretty good anime. It is neither the greatest nor the worst thing to ever be produced, contrary to how most people seem to be treating it.
                              One Punch Man was a fairly popular anime from the tail end of last year. It was based off of a webcomic by One, which has also been adapted into a manga. The anime came from Madhouse, which could be good or bad and there's no real way to ascertain which it is just because it has a lot of fans. After all, some of the worst anime I've seen have had pretty substantive fan bases. Then again, just last week I reviewed Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex: 2nd Gig, which was both popular and really good. So, let's take a look and          
                              “Saitama”, I guess that name often heard by all of the anime fans out there including me this lately. Well, that makes sense because this anime One Punch Man that adapted from a manga remake by Yusuke Murata and originally written by ONE has caught a large attention through it series. As most people knew, there’s pro and contra that shows up among anime fans out there about this show and because of that, I feel that I have to watch this no matter what. And now I finally did it so I’m gonna present this review of me for this anime. For more 20          
                              One Punch Man is an action comedy anime. If you expect deep meening, you're done. If you expect horror or something meaningfull, you're watching the wrong anime.
                              One Punch Man is a highly accurate parody of the shonen and superhero genres. It mimics them with stunning precision."

                              THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS
                              Youth.
                              I was hoping Sora yori mo Tooi Basho be an anime where cute girls wear ridiculously puffy winter coats against winter scenery, an adventure approached with the comfy manner. Instead this series focused too much on the serious side and contained loads of drama. 
                              This year—that is 2018, to warm up your Winter with an adventurous slice of life, Madhouse has brought close to you A Place Further Than The Universe.
                              Have you ever thought that life is meaningless? 
                              Journey. This one word has a heap of meanings behind its back. Why do we travel? The reasons range from being a collective success of mankind to discover a new plateau to just the sheer joy and curiosity that is obtained from setting foot in a new land. The air, the atmosphere, the scent... these things feel so different and anew and there is a kind of refreshment that you can only find in yourself after the exploration of an unknown place.
                              How would I describe this anime in 5 words? Realistic. Hilarious. Dramatic. Journey. Incredible.
                              This is not only the best anime of Winter 2018, which already imo was a really strong season, but it's one of my favorite anime series ever now. This series is not only an argument for the best things anime can do as a medium, but a full refutation of the idea that ""cute girls doing cute things"" is somehow a lesser form of the medium. This series is as inspiring, as heart-wrenching, as memorable, and as affecting as any of the most beloved anime series, and the team behind it deserve true kudos for indeed going on their own Impossible Journey and risking so

                              This is an anime that I'm sure many of you have heard about. Maybe hearing about it through various anime reviews with many people praising it for it's writing and called the anime of the winter 2018 season. But for me, I watch this long after the season has ended so I didn't get hyped and enjoyed to the fullest in my opinion.

"Humans have enjoyed their lavish, peaceful, and prosperous lives for seven years since the day the almighty Spiral King was defeated—the day they reclaimed their homeland, Earth. However, the boon of this lifestyle leaves them unprepared when an unknown, hostile threat arises due to the ever-growing human population. This calamity is the Anti-Spiral—a fearsome enemy with unparalleled power. 

As the Spiral King's prognosis postulating the destruction of ""The Spiral's World"" begins to come true, the pieces are in place, and Team Dai-Gurren is ready. With his late brother's hope to see a better future for mankind, Simon—along with Nia Teppelin and the rest of the team—is determined to overthrow the mighty Anti-Spiral in order to revive humanity's lost hope.

",8.57,8,82,883,169751,993,"                              If you're being shaken by the physics in this anime and feel the need to argue with them, you're missing the point. The second recap movie that introduces loads of new mechs to the Gurren Lagann multiverse is just as stunning as the original series was. Be warned as this review contains spoilers to the original Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann and the first movie. *The reason I purposely left out individual scores is because I can safely say that I was biased during watching this film, and I will thus be biased towards writing this review. Note: I am pro-Gurren Lagann and all for manly          
                              Lagann-hen is an exhilarating production with a setting of monumental proportions, though not without its flaws, which - in some cases - are unfortunately more apparent than in the first installment.
                              To write a spoiler-free review of lagann-hen is difficult, especially since there is quite some variation from the show. However, I will write this review on the basis that I don't want to spoil TTGL or Lagann-hen. 
                              Lagann hen  was a huge dissapointment for me.
                              This movie wasn&#039;t that great at some parts but I must say the ending was more epic then it needed to be then in the anime. They went over epically insane that I thought it would never end. The story wasn&#039;t that bad unlike the 1st movie and the music was still great and I wasn&#039;t as disappointed as I was the first.          
                              Oh my god. This might just be the best thing I've ever seen. When you thought you couldn't see anything not even close as epic as Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann's anime, the only thing that can top Gurren Lagann... is Gurren Lagann itself. 
                              *I'm writing this review for people mainly who have already seen Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, and will hopefully be worded in such a way that there aren't spoilers for the show for those who haven't seen TTGL.  I HIGHLY encourage those who haven't seen TTGL, to see it FIRST.*  
                              I'm not the type of person to watch anime films that re-cap an already completed series. However, being the huge Gurren Lagann fan that I am, I had to make an exception for this. By the time I finished these two films, I thought it was well worth it.
                              ""Listen, Simon. Don't Believe in yourself, Believe in ME! Believe in the Kamina who believes in you!""
                              I didn't think it could get better than episode 25 and 26 of Gurren Lagann. My God, was I wrong. Not only is TTGL a worthy conclusion to the series, it completely blows the anime away. The redone animation, updated visuals, fightscenes and new scenes are just perfect. In the anime, I didn't really feel any connection to NIa nor sad when she died. This time around, I was legit crying. I'm glad they changed a few other character deaths around too. My one complaint is the Kamina scene from episode 26 is not quite as sad here.  The music was perfect and I          
                                     When you thought you couldn't see anything not even close as epic as TTGL series, when you wonder how the hell could enough Spiral energy could be reunited in order to create such a brilliant masterpiece of a series, is when you notice that only one thing can beat TTGL: TTGL itself.
                              In order to watch this film one must first complete the series. As the movie would become very confusing. 
                              ""Get going, Simon. Don't let the what-ifs, maybes, and if-onlys distract you. The one thing that you choose yourself, that is the truth of your universe.""
                              The 2nd TTGL movie is a big improvement over the first one. More than half of the movie is based on new materials, making the story flows much better than the first movie. 
                              A great movie, for those that saw Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann anime, I have to reccomend it, most of the scenes of the are re-used were, it a couple of new ones for the final battle and others... I gave this a 9,because most of the stuff I have already experienced on the anime, even though, this movie made me relive everything I liked about the anime, which I finished a couple of weeks ago so I M was already aware of what I was going to get, it had impact, but not as much as the 27 episodes, what is perfectly fine. It consists          "
"As with its prequel, Zoku Natsume Yuujinchou is about Takashi Natsume, a boy who has had the ability to see youkai since he was young, and his bodyguard youkai Madara, nicknamed Nyanko-sensei. Natsume attempts to return names written in his ""Book of Friends"" (which he inherited from his grandmother Reiko) to youkai in his village. Throughout these adventures, he meets some youkai that are friendly, some that want to steal the Book, and some that want to kill him, as Natsume learns about himself and his relationship with these mysterious beings along the way.

                              Ahahaha~ I rated everything a ten. No. I'm not some mindless idiot who thought this series was the best thing since sliced bread. I'm a fellow reviewer who KNOWS this series is the best thing since sliced bread. Anyway, on with the review!
                              ""Continuing the path that must be done""
                              NOTE: Since the content in all three seasons is similar enough that they don't warrant separate reviews, they will all be covered here. The fourth will be edited in when it finishes, unless it differs heavily from the first three by the end of its run.
                              What makes an anime great?  Is it purely a mix of great story, well made animation and soundtrack and engaging characters?  Or does an anime need something extra to be regarded as truly great?  Some kind of x-factor that makes you feel like you’re watching something special?  I believe that a great anime needs both; that the x-factor that separates those shows you give 9 or 10 out of 10 from the others is created by having the great story, animation and so on.  I used to believe that this mix could only be obtained through complexity, with unexpected twists          
                              This series is a sequel to ""Natsume Yuujinchou"" which tells the story of a high school boy with the ability to see yokai. The plot revolves around his growing involvement with both the yokai and the people around him.

                              Loneliness, they are so overrated.
                              In the first moments of the series, what I automatically enjoyed was the altruistic view of the main character, Natsume Takashi. I had not the feeling of an overwhelming strong, stubborned or desperate human, just a cheerful guy who wants to help any person in danger.
                              Zoku Natsume is an example of a sequel done right. Like the first season, this show has all of the aesthetically pleasing things you cherished. The tone is still light-hearted, and often peaceful and mellow. Many times throughout this season you will feel a sort of familiar peace, and even melancholy. Finishing the season will without a doubt, leave you lonely, which is certainly ironic, considering the entire season, and show for that matter, has the idea of loneliness, and even to an extent, romanticizes it. 
                              Allow me to create a sub-genre of anime in which this particular one fits right in. I'd like to put this anime into the Zoo genre of anime. The Zoo genre is an anime which has some special monster or some unique creature within the show. Each episode introduces and focuses on one particular type of that creature. Shows like Mushishi, Fruits Basket, and Panty and Stocking all qualify for this genre of anime. In Natsume Yuujinchou's case, the monster is the Youkai, the demon-like beings which only Natsume, the main hero, can see. 
                              Im going to try to keep this as simple as possible for all you out there wondering what it's all about! 
                              I find this season so hard to review because it's literally the exact same as the first season. At least where it counts.
                              It’s already bad that the first season was very short, so when it ended I was genuinely sad yet irritated. Why can’t they make this amazing series longer! So I am so much grateful that it continues.
                              In this season, we see the seasons change from Winter to Spring as it continues to bring us this feel-good, warm fuzzy feeling that leaves you smiling. The change of seasons as if to reflect the shift in character in Natsume as well. It continues to tell us the story of the characters and Natsume fighting their everyday battles, loneliness and trying to gain acceptance from the people around them. "

                              The Garden Of Sinners Movie 5.
                              Overall: 9
                              The 5th chapter of Kara no Kyoukai brings a new level of epicness to the series. Chapter 5 is arguably the most exciting chapter of the movie series, it surely lived up to its expectations!
                              Given that I haven't rated any of the other Kara no Kyoukai movies below an 8, the harsh drop here certainly disturbs the graph. Indeed, a 6 might seem incongruous—and for the acclaimed fifth movie of all things! Rather than waste everyone's time by ill-advisedly trying to compress this movie's problems into a pithy introductory hook, I'll simply quote the antagonist, Souren Araya, as he expounds upon his villainous motivations in a dying speech near the end of this movie, the second-lengthiest in the Kara no Kyoukai franchise. Read aloud in sonorous tones for full impact.
                              idk man i watched that movie now and i feel weirdly depressed after that. i dont know what it is about those movies but they just leave me confused and unsatisfied. when i watched the first 3 movies i still had hope, educated myself on the storyline, tried to see through all this mess and understand the plot better. but now after the 5th movie where you would expect some kind of satisfaction and knowledge, it still feels unfamiliar and strange to me.

I hope people like this new style since the old essay style reviews are tl;dr and just take too long to write. Anyways here is the second anime I'll review under this new format***
                              I watched this movie two times. The first time I thought it was very impressive, from the animation to the story itself. After the second time, however, I have a very different opinion.
                              This is part 5 of the KnK series
                              Welcome, My Friends to film festival week. For those of you who don't remember, I did this in February of last year looking at Kara no Kyoukai 2 & 3, Ghost in the Shell, Animal Crossing, Blood the last Vampire, Night on the Galactic Railroad & End of Evangelion. This year I'm going to start out the same way I did last year, with another look at Kara no Kyoukai. To give a brief recap of how the series has scored so far, the first film was slow and incredibly stupid. The second film was suspenseful and good. The third film was okay but could          
                              If you are looking for something that could blow your mind away, this is what you WANT to check out. First thing that sticks out a mile is blood. Blood and gore. But unlike previous Kara no Kyoukai movies Mujun Rasen is a little bit less bloody and is more focused on action and story, which as I dare to think, makes it a lot more attractive. But it definetly kept that dark ambience of predecessors, and it is still Kara no Kyoukai. So It seems like after four inconsequent movies which made a sort of introduction, we finally got a perfect complete movie. 
                              Kara no Kyoukai 5: Mujun Rasen (Paradox Paradigm) review
                              Out of the 7 movies of the ""Garden of Sinners"" series, this is my personal favorite. It combines all the best aspects of the series in one complete package in terms of a well-scripted plot, art direction and atmosphere. The editing and visual imagery consist of some of the most imaginative and compelling of this series, or of any other.
                              The fifth installment of the Kara no Kyoukai of the movies but in chronological its a continues of the first movies kara no kyoukai 1:fukan fukei......at his movies,viewer will facing a really confusing while watching it,some scene will suddenly appeared that not follow the route of the whole story,that really make the viewer think ''what happens''.''how that happens'' and ''when that happens'',the unique about this movies is that 2 story but with different scene being combine to 1 story that really answered whole the story of it....at this movies,viewer will be introduce with the mastermind whose responsibility for whole the tragedy and and why he          "

Moreover, their rivals in Class A, as well as Kunugigaoka Junior High's fearsome principal, stand to block Class E from achieving academic excellence.

Thus, Class 3-E - the only class that teaches assassination - must come to an end, as well, whether the world goes down with it or not. In this season of Assassination Classroom, we get to see how it all ends, making it one of those anime that is actually a full adaptation of the original manga. When I watched the first season last year, I enjoyed it a whole lot; that was more than enough          
                              Mod Edit: This review may contain spoilers.
                              After finishing the first season, I started to question the direction of the story. It had its moments and the comedy was fairly good, but I wasn’t overall very impressed with it. The assassination premise is presented in a colourful and fun manner that it tends to take lightly of its consequences. It glorifies that assassination serves as a way for fellow assassins to create bonds and promote self-improvement. I can’t help but see it as a flaw, given that I’m already used to seinen titles that explore the world of assassination in detail and it’s definitely not all fun and games. The dynamic between          
                              I'm very conflicted about this anime, because on the one hand it is undoubtedly one of the best shows I've ever seen, but on the other hand it features both the most beautiful and most soul-crushing episode in existence.
                              (This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)
                              Now that you're reading this review, I'm assuming that you have already watched Season 1. Season 2 starts questionable but ends with a BOOM, it's better than Season 1 in my eyes.

                              AP classes, or Advanced Placement Classes are a kind of challenge that students put themselves through in order to show that they're the best of the best or much higher level than the rest.  These courses are much faster than their 'less advanced' counterparts, have much more material to them, and are usually less fun.  So why do I make this analogy?  Well, if AssClass S1 is a standard course, AssClass S2 is an AP course.  Case in point, onto the lecture as to why this show isn't as good as people may say it is.
                              STORY: 8/10
                              The story of the Assassination Clasroom is so beautifully written to pass on important messages and morals, about life and death, what it means to be a teacher and connections we have with the world around us. It makes you connect with the characters and feel their emotions from start to finish,you understand their pain as they have been rejected from their normal society for different reasons and you get to know each and every character (despite the amount of them) and its easy to imagine yourselves as part of that. This show is a must watch for anyone, and will touch the hearts of          
                              This is undoubtedly the best anime I've watched in my life thus far, its so unique you can define it as a genre itself, and that's what makes  Ansatsu Kyoushitsu so good
                              Assassination Classroom has now become my favourite anime of all time. The first season makes the entire thing seem like a pure comedy anime , but anyone who has finished both seasons will know this is not the case. The second season is absolutely amazing , just as you think you know how the anime will end there are 2 huge twists in the story. All of the questions are answered in season 2. Assassination Classroom also has very little filler. When a certain activity or situation does take up an entire episode , it is always for a very good reason or important to          
                              After glancing at the scores on the other reviews, it has quickly become clear that I do not share the popular opinion in regards to this season of Assassination Classroom. While I thought the first season was pretty average, I think this season was worse.
                              So season one was good i thought it was very funny but when season two started i  just knew it would be way different because march was coming.
                               The secont season of assassination classroom was great.You learn everyting you need to know about what happented to the past and the story becomes MUTCH better than the first season."

                              Quick Thoughts:
                              Tohru Honda literally changed me as a person. 
                              Fruits Basket: Sisterhood
                              You know, I remember coming out of the last season of this and thinking I had no idea what the overarching story was. Thankfully, this season finally told me. I more or less only want to talk about story in this review as I feel like most of my thoughts about this season come from that, so here it goes.
                              This show is way too highly rated. The first season was honestly very good, it brought up a good story and developed an interesting main cast. But the second season fell apart in my opinion. From my understanding the manga came before the first release of the anime at the turn of the century, but that doesn't help the fact that the cast of characters in S2 is just too big. There is no reason a show so driven on emotional attachment to the characters should try to stretch itself so thin. When I watched S1, I fell in love with all the main cast,          
                              It really surpirsed how this season was able to put out great episodes week-in and week-out. 
                              What does it mean to change? What is the name of that feeling of fear that comes with the thought of wanting to stretch out your hand and go beyond of the bubble that you’ve trapped yourself in? And truly, what does it mean to be happy and form genuine bonds in this twisted game we call Life?
                              For me,Fruits basket it’s the best of its genre.

                              So, anime is usually the only medium in which I go for romance stories, and this one hit me right in the feels at just the right time.  This season is significantly better if only for the fact that Tohru is not a literal conveyor belt for all the boys feelings anymore.  There's some degree of initiative finally, which is nice.  Additionally, I fell for Hatsuharu so damn hard (as evidenced by my new profile pic), and getting to explore his (and the other Zodiacs) story more was really nice.  Getting to explore side characters lives, who have no potential compared          
                              In this second season there is more focus on the members that interest us the most, so if you have already seen the first season, look at this second season with more scarves."
"Idly indulging in baseless paranormal activities with the Occult Club, high schooler Yuuji Itadori spends his days at either the clubroom or the hospital, where he visits his bedridden grandfather. However, this leisurely lifestyle soon takes a turn for the strange when he unknowingly encounters a cursed item. Triggering a chain of supernatural occurrences, Yuuji finds himself suddenly thrust into the world of Curses—dreadful beings formed from human malice and negativity—after swallowing the said item, revealed to be a finger belonging to the demon Sukuna Ryoumen, the ""King of Curses.""

Yuuji experiences first-hand the threat these Curses pose to society as he discovers his own newfound powers. Introduced to the Tokyo Metropolitan Jujutsu Technical High School, he begins to walk down a path from which he cannot return—the path of a Jujutsu sorcerer.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.55,8,86,124,725932,21738,"                              Jujutsu Kaisen is undoubtedly the 'other' big anime of Fall 2020 that everyone is talking about (The primary one of course being Haikyuu!! To the Top! Part 2). Of course everyone is praising this anime left and right. There are barely any negative reviews about this wherever I try to check, except for very few. To be very honest, I personally definitely am not the biggest fan of Jujutsu Kaisen.
                              [The following review was written right after episode 8 where I put the anime on-hold, but when episode 15 was out I picked it up again. See my UPDATED view down bellow]
                              *Contains minor spoilers*
                              Very good anime. The story is pretty interesting and leaves me wanting to watch. The art style is insane which I expected from the studio who did god of highschool. Seriously, the animation rivals mob psycho 100. This anime easily has the best OP and ED of the fall season too. The characters are likeable and I love Satorou and I also like how Yuuji and Kugisaki have funny moments together and aren't like sakura and naruto where sakura just punches him and stuff. Overall I give this a 10/10, good animation, good soundtrack, pretty good comedy, good job MAPPA          
                              This seems to be another of those run-of-the-mill power shonens. It has basically the same story as Chainsaw Man up till at least chap. 91 of that series manga, and i think Chainsaw Man will give us a much better experience. I don't expect the plot give us anything special tbh.
                              I rate shit on enjoyment because that is what's important. Shit's lit, so watch it if you like high quality action scenes with moments of light heartedness but with a general dark theme. Mixes really well in my opinion and I suggest highly. 
                              MC is very bad... Yuji's entire personality is based around a grandpa we knew for 1 episode with a screen time of less than a minute. and said like 7 words. yet his 7 words will dictate how the main character will act for possibly the rest of this series. very unfortunate that the author thinks we should care about someone that had less screen time than a no name curse. For the other characters, I see a lot of potential and hope they carry the load. Villains are mediocre at best except for one who's extensive backstory and connections to current characters is pretty          
                              Jujutsu Kaisen doesn't wanted to redeem the shounen genre with something new. Rather the ""better"" one or the complete enjoyment package which Jujutsu Kaisen are really made for. Or made of.
                              Jujutsu Kaisen is unlike any other anime I have seen before. When I first saw the trailer for it I thought that it was not really my style; seeming like a horror anime with obscure powers and weird monsters. Although Jujutsu Kaisen is this to a point it is so much more. As it does focus on the premise of curses, you can expect a horror aspect to this anime, which may not be your cup of tea, but trust me there is so much to offer in this anime. 
                              I'll give this review straight to the point! (10/10)
                              Pretty Neat
                              Ah yes, rating an anime even when only 1/4 of the whole series have dropped are we?
                              Its just an anime with bad/average story and no depth with masterful animation. 
                              Okay, i get the hype its pretty cool shonen and its been 8 episodes out now. But its add nothing new to the genre. You can see the series got influenced a LOT by other shonen anime. For example :
                              I'm not too far along in this series, but I can say that I am excited to see what this series brings. Jujutsu Kaisen is a refreshing take on Shonen anime, and it's didn't take long for me to get fully invested. If you like your battle Shonen, I feel you will like this anime. Jujutsu Kaisen is quirky and has a great story idea. I don't believe this anime ventures into a darker territory (at least from what I see), but it definitely dips its toes in it. It's as mature as any other Shonen anime."
"Following the closure of the ""Laughing Man"" case, Section 9 is re-established by Japan's newly elected Prime Minister, Youko Kayabuki, to combat the persistent threat of cyber-terrorism.

A group calling themselves ""The Individual Eleven"" has begun committing acts of terror across Japan. While Motoko Kusanagi, Daisuke Aramaki, Batou, and the other members of Section 9 investigate this new menace, the Japanese government faces a separate crisis, as foreign refugees displaced by the Third World War seek asylum in Japan. But as the members of the special-ops team continually encounter Gouda Kazundo—a leading member of the Cabinet Intelligence Service—in their hunt, they begin to suspect that he may be involved, and that the events of the refugee crisis and The Individual Eleven may be more connected than they realize...

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.54,8,89,781,192123,3023,"                              NOTE: If you haven't seen 'Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex' I recommend you watch that first.  I have reviewed that as well.
                              A couple years back I reviewed Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex, and it was fantastic with complex characters and compelling writing. It's one of the few things I've given a “10” rating. There's a sequel to the series, 2nd GIG, that came out not long after the first. So, will it be up to the same standard? Let's delve in and see.
                              It’s hard for me not to lavish praise upon the altar that is Ghost in the Shell, as I’ve always found the entire franchise to be among the pillars of great anime science fiction.  Each movie and show has delved deep into psychology, spirituality and even to some degree religion.  The question is how would Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex 2nd GIG stand up to the incredible first season and movies.  The answer is: it continued to raise that bar of excellence in this franchise.
                              The 2nd gig is a real disappointment compared to the first season of Ghost in the Shell.  There are two interconnected storylines (Gouda and the Cabinet of Intelligence; The Particularist Eleven) that run side by side and eventually are tied together.  It's an interesting storytelling approach but wasn't executed particularly well.  They should have taken a more conventional approach by having the storylines run more in parallel within each episode, and not have episodes dedicated mainly to one or the other.  I can't help but feel some coherence was sacrificed for this interesting innovation.  
                              After watching the fantastic first series of SAC I could not wait to get sunk into the 2nd Gig, however I was only met with disappointment. What made the first series so compelling and original was totally missing in 2nd Gig. 
                              Overall: This is actually one of my favorite anime series, when you watch it right after GitS:SAC, it flows pretty well. If you like a pretty deep sci-fi psychological action thriller, then GitS:SAC 2nd G will do well in pleasing you.
                              I love the complex story telling. Even though there are a lot of twists in the plot, in the ends it easily merges and effortlessly tells the story.
                              Continuing off from the first season, Ghost in the Shell 2nd GIG effectively makes itself into a political thriller series where what comes across at first sight as Section 9 trying to halt terrorist activity turns into an elaborate political conspiracy that once again pushes Section 9 to its limit in trying to halt. Much like the first season, 2nd GIG explores what appears to be a typical case for Section 9 to get involved in. But as they uncover more holes in facts being shown on the surface with said case, they become entangled in something much bigger than originally anticipated. In this case,          
                              Ghost in the Shell 2nd gig, second part of the Stand Alone Complex story-line of the Ghost in the shell franchise, is one of those anime which aren't usually talked about much, but of course, you might have heard about it but not too many discussions around. Now does it deserve more recognition or it just wasn't worth noting? Oh who am I kidding, I gave it a 9, of course it does, its not perfect though, but still close. 
                              The GIG is up! The 2nd GIG! 
                              In my previous review (on Eden of the East, please read it :D), I provided a long explanation and list of arguments that detail why director Kenji Kamiyama is a hack writer. I have nothing against the man on a personal level, I have never interacted with him, I currently have no reason to believe that he is not a kind person, and I have quite a bit of respect for his directorial style, but I do not find his writing very appreciable. So far, the only work of his that I thought was actually good was the first season of Stand Alone Complex (I          
                              (This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site)
                              2nd Gig is a continuation of Ghost in the Shell: Standalone Complex. They're so similar I'd rather just talk about their differences here. The atmosphere, execution, and characters are all the same. The only thing that changes is the story. The story in 2nd Gig is simply worse, which is weird. It feels just as epic and dense, but it's not. The music, the directing, the monologues, they're all there. But, the substance is missing. It feels like a Shell of its predecessor, missing its Ghost. I know I said earlier that the characters were the same, but that's the missing factor. The Laughing Man          
                              Masterpiece. Again. And just gotta love the last episode, like ep6 of Star Wars: when all the pieces of a brilliant 3D-puzzle fall into place. Quite overwhelming really, having to arrive to understand what everything's been about, even the details that made no sense earlier...but that's just like the first series, too. Same with how they close all the plotlines at the end, no open questions, no events left hanging in the air. Same with the complexity as well, woven together from many abstract layers, a feast for thought.
                              Stand Alone Complex was based on Yoshiki Sakurai’s 2001 Media Ecology dissertation “The Whereabouts of the Other in the Future of Human-Robot Interaction” (「他我を宿す条件 ～人間・ロボット間コミュニケーションの行方～」)."

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.53,8,90,1415,98586,3615,"                              All good things must end, as the saying goes.
                              This is my first review; and what better series to review than the glorious Aria the Origination. 
                              Before watching Aria the Origination, you have to have watched the prequels - The Animation, The Natural and The OVA: Arietta - otherwise you will be doing yourself - but more importantly this series - a great disservice. Because Origination, being the grand finale of the franchise, demands that you as a viewer has formed bonds to the setting and characters of the Aria universe; if you haven't, you will automatically disarm the bomb of emotion that is this third and last season of Aria.
                              All things eventually have to come to an end, especially with series that have left a mark on many people. One series that has cemented itself as the king of accomplishing this for many is the Aria series. What many consider to be the series’s magnum opus, Aria the Origination is the last chapter in the anime adaptation of the beloved manga. As you might figure out, it is just about as glamoured with gorgeous music, cheerful characters, and melodramatic optimism as one can handle. Despite all of the beautiful aspects of this show, and the series as a whole, there’s still that one question          
                              The last voyage to Neo-Venezia? 
                              *This is my first review
                              The third season of Aria, Aria the Origination is a stunning and satisfying conclusion to the Aria story. With 2 seasons and a few OVAs behind it, I would say Aria the Origination has perfected the slice of life formula, hence its very well deserved high scores. I did analyze this alot, but at the end concluded that a review of this series would only be effective if it came from the heart :)
                              I had to mark down other anime's score because they couldn't come even close to Aria.
                              Aria the Origination is the marvelous conclusion of Akari, Alice, and Aika’s journey as undines in training while retaining all of the charm and glorious pace of its predecessors.
                              This is the final season of Aria, and what a bittersweet one it is. I’m so glad to have discovered this wonderful series, meeting characters and settings I won’t ever forget.
                              Aria the Origination has achieved something remarkable to which anyone who's familiar with the slice of live genre knows to be an extremely rare phenomenon; it manages to end satisfactory.    
                              ""Wonderful...""
                              Aria is a calm, cheerful series that seeks to find simple meaning in ordinary things. However, what meaning is found is usually of a trite nature, such as the love of one’s art being the most important thing in said art. Not only are such messages common and forgettable, but they even occasionally range close to the absurd. Several of the episodes don’t even have applicable morals, and these merely depict the characters enjoying their everyday lives and appreciating simple pleasures. The series seems more preoccupied with wondering at the workings of a nonexistent city than anything else.
                              [DISCLAIMER] As I want to get all my points across, as well as bring this show the justice it deserves, the following review is a lengthily-detailed breakdown of every factor ranging from the story to the overall experience. You may look for other reviews to find a more concise criticism of the show.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.53,8,91,1156,129014,951,"                              If you’ve made it this far into the Gintama series, chances are you’ll be watching this regardless of any reviews or recommendations. You’re probably invested in the characters, not to mention the buildup to the finale that has gradually been revealed through the last two arcs. 
                              Introduction:
                              This review of Gintama is about the whole series from 2006-2017 including the Slip Arc. It's my tribute for these years that I spent together with Gintama. Enjoy!
                              I'll keep it short because Porori-hen is for me like OVA for me rather than another season as it's between serious Gintama arcs, so I'll rate it subjectively.
                              For those of you wondering what this season is about, it's a season of comedy episodes that are adapted from manga chapters released before the content from episode 300 onwards. For those of you wondering if it's a nice break before the final arc of Gintama... not really.
                              Why am I even writing this review?  I'm two years late, and this is 330 episodes in. Does it even matter?  Of course it doesn't matter.  But, I'm addicted to leaving reviews so here is a pointless one for people who've already invested literally a decade of their lives getting this far into the series.
                              (This review applies to the entire Gintama series.)
                              The concept of time in the universe of Gintama is by far its most fascinating meta subject. For as much as the show likes to mock itself for its seemingly unchanging sitcom status quo, the fact is that Edo has never been frozen in time. The world has evolved with the show, with new characters, new relationships, old relationships developing and deepening, new playing fields of possibility being opened, and an increasingly changing understanding of the foundation fabric of the story itself., whether in massive game-changing arcs or the nuances of the ever-evolving sitcom antics themselves. Like its central character, Gintama is a show that          
                              Gintama has been going strong for a reasonable amount of time now and still proves to be the best of the best!
                              Its really amazing how Gintama doesn't care about randomly getting into slip arcs and still jokes about it, ""...stuff happened, and now we're here""
                              After focusing on the central plot, Gintama returns to its essence with the focus on comedy, parodies and presentation of new characters, except for the more dramatic tone of the Ikumatsu bow that had the closing of the development of this character.
                              As an show on its own, this season was decent. However, it somewhat falls short as a gintama season. It is not that this season was bad, but gintama has raised the bar so high that if it is a disappointment if it is anything less than amazing.
                              I am really big fan of Gintama I have watched every episode and I was really exited when new season started airing. "

                              So if you can tell from my score, I really freaking love this anime.  I have to preface this by saying, I am NOT a sports anime fan. It's one of the last genres I look to because I've disliked/dropped over 90% of the ones I've seen. So I'm incredibly biased.
                              The most important thing in a team sports is, without a doubt, the team. This holds especially true for volleyball. Having six talented players is all fine, but as long as they aren’t a team and don’t show team spirit, that talent is surely in vain. But what if it’s the other way round; is it a surefire way to win when you have one team where not everyone is talented?
                              “So long as I am here, you will be the strongest” – Tobio Kageyama 
                              There’s a phrase that goes “dynamite come in little packages”. The meaning implies that someone who is small can achieve big accomplishments. Shoyo Hinata, the protagonist of the series is a perfect example of this. Standing no more than 6 feet tall but yet has a big heart, Hinata is someone filled with integrity. Witness the extraordinary journey that Hinata undertakes to prove the whole world his worth as a volleyball player. And believe me, it’s worth it especially when it’s someone named the “Ultimate Decoy”. 
                              Bring on season 2.
                              I just want to start this by saying i have never seen a sports anime before, this is my first step into the genre, and i've heard this show has a lot going for it, it isn't reliant on fan service like others, it has a rich story and unique characters, and it has a killer art style. Sadly i would say only 2 of those things are true, the killer art style and it not being reliant on fan service. 
                              Teamwork. Talent. Hardwork. Winning. Losing.
                              I had wanted to see Haikyuu for a while and I was so surprised at how much I liked it. I knew I would like it but not the 'I'm going to marathon the entire thing in one night' type of like. 
                              I think this anime series had a perfect mix of it all.
                              Wow... I was never really planning on writing a review on MAL, but I just feel compelled to share my thoughts on this breathtaking anime.
                              Alright, I'm going to preface this review by saying that this will for the most part be subjective, with only my final comments justifying why I believe Haikyuu is a 10. 
                              Haikyuu is a volleyball anime that tells a story of a not-gifted-in-terms-of-height freshmen high school student named Hinata Shoyo, who dreams to become the next ""little giant"" in volleyball. 
                              God awful show. Im just bewildred how can people actually like this and find this trash enjoyable? Story was the worst i've ever seen in my entire anime career, volleyball is boring enough on its own but im jsut so suprised that Haruichi (creator) found out a way to make it even more boring! I will give props to the animation it does the best it can to make a terrible show into a barely watchable show. The OPs are garbage and the same goes for the endings not even the soundtrack or the character voices are decent everything is just a mess of the

Soon, after certain events, Hanamichi is left with two unwavering thoughts: ""I hate basketball,"" and ""I desperately need a girlfriend.""

One day, a girl named Haruko Akagi approaches him without any knowledge of his troublemaking ways and asks him if he likes basketball. Hanamichi immediately falls head over heels in love with her, blurting out a fervent affirmative. She then leads him to the gymnasium, where she asks him if he can do a slam dunk. In an attempt to impress Haruko, he makes the leap, but overshoots, instead slamming his head straight into the blackboard. When Haruko informs the basketball team's captain of Hanamichi's near-inhuman physical capabilities, he slowly finds himself drawn into the camaraderie and competition of the sport he had previously held resentment for.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.53,8,93,728,203240,5539,"                              Slam Dunk is one of those classics of sports anime.  You always hear about it and wonder if it actually is the best thing since sliced bread.  Well, it isn't.  But it is funny and entertaining and worthwhile if you have the patience for it.
                              This anime has almost everything. Action, comedy, tragedy, romantic tensions, manly moments, etc. The cast is pretty huge and when possible, each character or group gets their chance to shine. A great percentage of the characters each contribute something to the advancement of the story and/or get their moment in the sun so. It doesn’t have to be Sakuragi, or the rest of the Shohoku team. Even Sakuragi’s gang gets their chance to do something every now and then. 
                              Slam Dunk is considered a pioneer of sports anime. All from its witty jokes to its inspiring speeches, it’s a masterpiece from the 90s. It teaches many valuable morals of life such as establishing strong bonds with each other, and to never give up. It’s an anime that’s been a part of my childhood, and I knew from its first episode that it would be hilarious. 
                              Slam dunk is, in my opinion, the best anime i've seen.
                              Slam Dunk! Is a sports comedy anime telling a story of a school basketball team and a newcomer Sakuragi Hanamichi, who basicly joins the club just to get the attention of a girl after being dumped by girls way too many times in the past. And as you might guess, Sakuragi then truly gets interested in basketball after hard training and finding himself - what a surprise - a rival in both basketball and girl attention aspects. The story itself is pretty decent, maybe a bit too predictable though. The animation and sounds (music, voice actors etc.) in this anime is average, considering the fact          
                              For a anime to be called Slam Dunk one of the most flashy, epic, move that blows away anyone watching, to then be so tedious and incomplete that I would have dropped it from the start. 
                              Slam Dunk, the first thing it'd tell me is Basketball! :) i've been playing bball for sometime now, and this anime was out just before i was born:) 
                              One of my favourite animes since I was around 7 years old. It's hilarious, has the perfect amount of drama, comedy, suspense and action (in it's own rights). Always love re-watching and re-re-watching episodes whenever I'm bored. 
                              Instead of writing a paragraph of review, I will basically list all the good things I thought abou tthis show:
                              Slam dunk is one of the anime which is pretty well known. In my opinion this anime is over hyped with no content to support it. First the story, the story in itself feels a little dull. I said dull because in over hundered episode the story could have been amazing. I will not spoil the story, but trust me this anime have a little content for a 101 episode anime. The matches are long ( episode wise), smallest match I ever seen in this anime was 5 episode long. You feel bored in half way through the anime. The character development feels well paced          
                              Slam Dunk is probably one of the most beautiful sports anime I have ever come acrossed. It is one of those animes that will be forever be memorable once you have watched it.
                              I'm a little biased, this is my favorite anime/manga of all time. And as it turns out, not just mine. Slam Dunk has been voted as being Japan's favorite manga of all time. Takehiko Inoue is also one of the most revered and acknowledged mangaka ever. Following Slam Dunk, he has created several other masterpieces, namely Vagabond which I haven't read yet. But apparently it has received some very distinguished awards. But regarding Slam Dunk, it's not like Kuroko where the characters are dramatized by the color of their hair, by special abilities only relevant in sci fi. It's a lot more realistic, and the          
                              To me, Slam Dunk was one of the anime I used to watch as a kid on AXN. It is about the national Shohoku basketball team developing their relationships as well as their fitness levels. This anime says that basketball really comes in all sorts of tricks and I like the way how they dribble the ball and throw the ball into the net. The net gives the score.

                              This anime is straight 10 in every aspects for me. I had watched first time when I was 6 six years old with its limited episodes on TV. Slam Dunk is the reason why I started playing basketball and loved that sport so much. It increases popularity of basket not only in Japan but in other countries. "
"Gol D. Roger was known as the ""Pirate King,"" the strongest and most infamous being to have sailed the Grand Line. The capture and execution of Roger by the World Government brought a change throughout the world. His last words before his death revealed the existence of the greatest treasure in the world, One Piece. It was this revelation that brought about the Grand Age of Pirates, men who dreamed of finding One Piece—which promises an unlimited amount of riches and fame—and quite possibly the pinnacle of glory and the title of the Pirate King.

Enter Monkey D. Luffy, a 17-year-old boy who defies your standard definition of a pirate. Rather than the popular persona of a wicked, hardened, toothless pirate ransacking villages for fun, Luffy's reason for being a pirate is one of pure wonder: the thought of an exciting adventure that leads him to intriguing people and ultimately, the promised treasure. Following in the footsteps of his childhood hero, Luffy and his crew travel across the Grand Line, experiencing crazy adventures, unveiling dark mysteries and battling strong enemies, all in order to reach the most coveted of all fortunes—One Piece.

                              THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS
                              Review In short, 
                              In my personal opinion, One Piece is one of those animes that is easy to love and is just as easy to hate. Funnily enough, those who love One Piece love it for exactly the same reasons that others hate it; the extreme characters, zany abilities, and classic artstyle all contribute to both sides. This review's goal is neither to covince you to love One Piece, nor is it the opposite. The review merely expresses my own personal views of the series.
                              Lets start with the story. 
                              One Piece recounts the story of Monkey D Luffy, a young man who wishes to become the Pirate King; and the rest of the crew of the Mugiwara ('Straw Hat') Pirate crew, each of whom join the crew to realise lifelong dreams of their own.
                              One Piece has been running for 15 years now and shows zero signs of slowing down. It is true that there are several anime and manga series that have run for MUCH longer, but that doesn't honestly excuse One Piece for how long it has overstayed it's welcome! One Piece has a diehard fandom and it is by far the highest in average rating out of the big 4 shonens. However, it is actually my LEAST favorite of the big 4. I'm dead serious, I really don't like One Piece and I will explain why.
                              OnePiIISSWuaaaa!!!
                              I haven't written a review in almost a year so i might as well start with this
                              Well my first review, Ill try and make it a good one. 
                              Ask any person on the internet what their favourite kind of warrior is and you are bound to get one of these 2 answers. Ninja or Pirate. Now we ALL know Ninja\'s are a plenty in anime. But Pirates? Try finding a anime about that!
                              I never write reviews but I think this series deserves it.
                              Ah, One Piece. The anime adaptation of the best selling manga in the world. I used to like this show when I first started watching it, but sadly I don't feel the same way about it anymore."
"Japan, 1955: Mario Minakami has just arrived at Shounan Special Reform School along with five other teenagers who have been arrested on serious criminal charges. All assigned to the same cell, they meet older inmate Rokurouta Sakuragi—a former boxer—with whom they establish a close bond. Under his guidance, and with the promise that they will meet again on the outside after serving their sentences, the delinquents begin to view their hopeless situation in a better light.

Rainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin follows the seven cellmates as they struggle together against the brutal suffering and humiliation inflicted upon them by Ishihara, a sadistic guard with a grudge on Rokurouta, and Gisuke Sasaki, a doctor who takes pleasure in violating boys. Facing such hellish conditions, the seven inmates must scrape together all the strength they have to survive until their sentences are up; but even if they do, just what kind of lives are waiting for them on the other side?

                              What exactly is friendship? Are your friends more important to you than your family? What are you willing to go through for a friend? Rainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin (for the rest of the review the anime will be referred to simply as Rainbow) focuses on friendship, as well as several other themes based around friendship, such as humanity, morality, violence, love, family etc. This is my review:
                              Rainbow : Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin - after watching episodes of this anime, one word kept coming to my mind. ""Beautiful"". This anime shows how beautiful friendship can be. Acts of selflessness, sacrificing oneself to help another, returning to that one special place - It's all present in Rainbow. It's a good mix of emotion, struggle and drama. Rainbow is one superb anime, regrettably, it's buried deep within the other numerous popular titles out there and I'm glad I found it(more like stumbled upon).
                              'RAINBOW - The Seven from Cell 2-6' is about seven teens who spent time in same cell of Shounan Disciplinary School after committing separate juvenile crimes in 1955.
                              Rainbow starts off fine with an interesting concept (boys from post WWII) but this show could have been so much more if they really stuck to that principle. As stated early on, the author wanted to emphasize the coolness of his characters, and given that, it shows in how little this anime develops anything else.
                              Overview:
                              ""No matter how tired you are, or how much punishment you take, look into his eyes. Never look down.""
                              ""Most people are prisoners, thinking only about the future or living in the past. They are not in the present, and the present is where everything begins."" - Carlos Santana.
                              Friendship is an extremely common theme in anime (in any medium for that matter) but rarely is it portrayed in hell. Set in a crippled 1950's Japan, Rainbow thrusts its seven protagonists into a juvenile refinement center, which is essentially a youth prison filled with guards who are out for blood. They give each other nicknames, befriend each other over a smoke, and carve their dreams on a tree for when they're finally free, and agree to meet there once again in the future.
                              The problem with ourselves right now is we usually too arrogant and easily judged anime just by seeing the cover. Without watching or see it, we can easily bashed and even judge the anime before even giving it a shot. Many covers in anime sometimes didnt really represent on whats gonna happen in the anime itself, Like Rainbow : Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin.
                              THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS!
                              Rainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin. This anime goes into the dark theme of seven teenagers forced to suffer for their crimes in a detention facility just after the WWII. The story follows these seven teenagers in trying to survive the cruelty of the warden and the detention center in general. The story progression may be a bit slow at times but it surely delivers. Story: 8/10
                              'Grasshoppers can fly, so can birds. Yet.....aren't we even allowed to dream'
                              In the aftermath of the most devastating war in history, inside a reformatory, an unbreakable friendship is born between seven children.
                              Another beautiful anime. Rainbow is truly an underrated gem that I happen to stumble upon and I was really amazed of how well everything is made in this anime and how well it showed the values of love, friendship and hope is very important in life."

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.52,8,98,1544,89850,1199,"                              Before Chihayafuru season 3 got announced, I’m sure some fans have been clinging onto hopes that the franchise would again take the anime medium by storm. The first two seasons have gained a cult following since the franchise introduced us to the world of its karuta and wonderful cast of characters. Now more than six years later, we are back in this franchise as if it’s almost yesterday.
                              *Minimum Spoiler Review*
                              First things first - karuta isn't a sport. It's just a game that that some folks took way too seriously. Well, not like that has any impact on the anime, I just wanted to get this out of my chest. But it also means that you might enjoy this even if you don't like sport anime in general.
                              Chihayafuru is a manga series written and illustrated by Yuki Suetsugu; Chihayafuru is her first animated work, but not the first manga. The manga has been serialized in Be Love(Kodansha) since December 2007. Third season of the series aired in 2019, which is 6 years later after the second season. The manga, as well as the TV series, have won many awards; the manga also has more than 16 million copies in print.
                              After a seven year long break, Chihayafuru is finally back and it’s better than ever before. Fans, rejoice, because this is by far the best season of Chihayafuru and with some small exceptions this season has otherwise improved on every aspect compared to prior seasons. This review will outline the exact places where this series has improved, and why I believe this show deserves the highest rating of any sports anime around.
                              *Disclaimer*
                              This anime definitely is not for everyone. I don't know why is it rated so high, by so many people. I'll explain just 7 points why you can watch it and why you can't. 
                              ちはやふる 3  -  Chihayafuru 3 is an endearing sequel to the past seasons with the same distinctive charm and a lot of heart. It is a really beautiful series that appeals to a wide audience with excitement, fun and emotions and entertains them great. The third season, my third review of the series, and I still recommend the series as much as I did at the beginning.
                              Though we are parted,
                              Before starting Chihayafuru, I'm sure most people wondered how interesting a Japanese card game based Anime could be. Much to our delight, Chihayafuru 1 and 2 made us fall in love with Karuta and the Hyakunin Isshu, along with all the characters. While they both were pretty good Anime themselves, Chihayafuru 3 is better than the previous seasons by a huge margin, in every department - the Karuta, the romance, the character development, and the overall feel of Chihayafuru in general.
                              Chihayafuru the 1 and 2 season were great and fun but 3rd is more dark and sad. 
                              I write this review in a vain attempt to get even a single extra person to watch this. Even though this is a season 3 review, perhaps in some small way this tiny blip will contribute a fraction of a fraction of a percent to increasing its popularity. I truly believe this is one of those hallmark shows, one that every anime viewer should see.
                              i absolutely love the payoff for all the events of the previous two seasons. all of the things happen, all of the story development, all of the character developments.... it all goes down here

                              Once again, the 3rd season picks up exactly where the 2nd season left off. Most of the season takes place during the second half of the second year of Ayase and Mashima in their high school Karuta club, except for the last couple of episodes, which take place during the beginning of the third year."
"The year is 1999. Morioh, a normally quiet and peaceful town, has recently become a hotbed of strange activity. Joutarou Kuujou, now a marine biologist, heads to the mysterious town to meet Jousuke Higashikata. While the two may seem like strangers at first, Jousuke is actually the illegitimate child of Joutarou's grandfather, Joseph Joestar. When they meet, Joutarou realizes that he may have more in common with Jousuke than just a blood relation.

Along with the mild-mannered Kouichi Hirose and the boisterous Okuyasu Nijimura, the group dedicates themselves to investigating recent disappearances and other suspicious occurrences within Morioh. Aided by the power of Stands, the four men will encounter danger at every street corner, as it is up to them to unravel the town's secrets, before another occurs.

                              David Production was hardly a household name in the otaku community a few years ago. However everything changed when the fire nation attacked...I mean when they released their JoJo's Bizarre Adventure adaptation in 2012! While the budget was pretty low, David Production blew the community away with their attention to detail and loyalty to the source material and JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Part 4: Diamond is Unbreakable is no exception to this.
                              To anime and manga fans, Jojo is a classic that many may have heard of. Even if you’re not familiar with the franchise, you’ll bound to hear something related to Jojo somewhere whether it’d be a joke, meme, or reference. Diamond is Unbreakable chronicles the fourth expansion of the franchise and it’s among one of the most celebrated. As a personal favorite, Diamond is Unbreakable sets up for an adventure that is far more than bizarre.
                              JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken Part 4: Diamond wa Kudakenai, the 4th part of Hirohiko Araki's iconic manga series. After the most iconic manga series of all-time, stardust crusaders, what can you do? Well, you make the greatest bit of media to even scrape the heavens.
                              I'd like to preface this review by saying I totally understand why you might enjoy this show. Don't just look at this review, see its rating then click off. This review is a thorough dissection of Araki's Manga and DP's adaption of DiU. It's more of a fun than deep experience but I'm going to explain why DiU's critical flaws make the show very VERY difficult for me to enjoy. 
                              You though Stardust Crusaders would be the last of the JoJo adaptations, but it was me, Diamond is Unbreakable! Jokes aside, the adaptation of the next part is finally over after a 39-episode run. David Production has proven to be a very loyal studio when it comes to adaptations. For the last couple of years, David Production have been working on adapting the JoJo's Bizarre Adventure manga series written by Araki Hirohiko into an anime format. After doing an adaptation for the first three JoJo parts, David Production has adapted the fourth Part of the series, Diamond wa Kudakenai also known as Diamond is Unbreakable          
                              I have come to the conclusion the mangaka behind JoJo, after Phantom Blood and Battle Tendency, simply don't care about creating a world anymore and blinded fans simply take this series as it is the ultimate Shounen adventure.
                              Jojo: Diamond (PT 4).
                              Holy shit, this was a masterpiece.

                              JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken: Diamond wa Kudakenai Review
                              Jojo's Bizarre Adventure in general is an interesting show because I don't like it for a very specific reason. I dislike Jojo because I cannot ignore the fact people explain the plot or fight moves while standing by spectating. Yes, sometimes the show will poke fun at itself with Jojo saying ""Why are you just standing there"" (or something to that effect) but I just can't. It reminds me of shows where suddenly the hero gains some ridiculous power or strength because love, friendship, or intense emotional states. Bleh. 
                              The JoJo franchise is one I have some fondness for. It has an absurd naming scheme, over the top machismo & action, but I've still found it pretty endearing. I've talked about JoJo, Stardust Crusaders series 1 & 2. This time around, I'll be discussing Diamond is Unbreakable. Like the others, this is brought to us by David Production. It aired from April to December of 2016. I look forward to seeing a bunch of characters named after musicians & bands fighting in an absurdly over the top fashion. Let's get right to it.
                              DORARARARA!
                              Having been binging JoJo for the past few weeks, part 4 was the show I really wanted to write a review for. Until I saw it from myself I couldn’t believe that the growth in writing between seasons would be so significant. And with part 4, I feel like this is more apparent than ever. "

                              End of Evangelion is truly a masterpiece of an anime movie. 
                              When a film starts with the main character giving himself a wank over an unconscious girl after he reveals her breasts by accident, you know you're in for a treat.

                              Do NOT watch this movie. It is the single most soul-crushingly depressing thing ever spawned from the depths of human imagination. It takes all of the closure, hopes, and expectations you had for the end of the series and blasts them into the sun. It is the single worst possible ending to anything EVER.
                              It's here, the one I really am not looking forward to. Yeah, I'm familiar with Neon Genesis Evangelion. I watched a good amount of it before deciding to just read the synopses for the remaining episodes to see if the characters ever stopped being unbearable only to immediately drop it when I learned that not only were the characters never going to improve but the plot was going to get really stupid really fast. To this day the popularity of the franchise baffles me. My best guess is that a lot of people can't tell the difference between depth and pretension so anything like Evangelion          
                              The ending to the popular Anime series, Neon Genesis Evangelion, left many questions as to the fate of NERV, the children, the Angels, and many other plot factors unanswered or otherwise hanging.

                              End of Evangelion is a two-hour movie that consists of two hour-long episodes (Episodes 25 and 26) that was released on July 19th, 1997, has been licensed Stateside by Manga Entertainment, and was originally released over here on September 24th, 2002.  Episode 25 incorporates and expands upon footage from the Rebirth segment from the Death and Rebirth movie (released on March 15th of that same year), and is based off the original script for Episode 25.  It was produced by Production IG (famous for their work on the Ghost in the Shell series and xxxHOLIC) and Gainax (famous for their work on His          
                              After watching the final two episodes of the TV series, I couldn't help but feel a bit short-changed. Where was the action-packed finale I had hoped for? Most of all where was the result of the Human Instrumentality Project, it was all a bit too ambiguous and all played out within Shinji's mind - quite simply I didn't get it. Anno's attempt at a clever and deeply meaningful ending frankly falls short of its goal and leaves us frustrated (at least me anyhow).

"The eccentric, self-proclaimed mad scientist Rintarou Okabe has become a shell of his former self. Depressed and traumatized after failing to rescue his friend Makise Kurisu, he has decided to forsake his mad scientist alter ego and live as an ordinary college student. Surrounded by friends who know little of his time travel experiences, Okabe spends his days trying to forget the horrors of his adventures alone.

                              Many who watched this series have missed the point of it, it isn't like the original, no it wasn't supposed to surpass it like many suspected here. It is here to complete it, you may have not noticed but the original had many things that we had yet to see. This isn't a what if story either, this is the story of Okabe who failed to find Steins Gate, the same one who fell under depression because of it.
                              There comes a time when fans of a franchise should ask themselves if an established franchise deserves a sequel or not. Let’s face it. Steins;Gate made an impact back in 2011 when it became one of the critically acclaimed adaptations that year. Visuals novels aren’t easy to adapt and in fact, most recent series really proved themselves to be a catastrophe in that territory. Steins;Gate is one of those properties that didn’t really need a sequel although fans have been asking for years. And it’s a bit painful for me to say….but Steins;Gate 0 didn’t truly live up to the name it made for itself.

                              Man, my feelings toward this anime- though mostly positive- are extremely complicated, which isn’t helped by the fact that I played the visual novel first. So get your popcorn, cuz this review’s gonna be a while! Also, there will be spoilers regarding the original Steins;Gate in this review, since you’re supposed to have played/watched it first anyway.
                              Disclaimer: I will not be comparing this to the VN whatsoever, just the fact that it is a bit different in how it's layed out. It's to be expected though; trying to cram the enormous VN into a 23 episode anime was going to be impossible. Also I expect you to fully know what happened in the original Steins;Gate

"A reunion that was supposed to spell the arrival of peaceful times is quickly shattered when Subaru Natsuki and Emilia return to Irlam village. Witnessing the devastation left behind by the calamities known as Sin Archbishops, Subaru sinks into the depths of despair as his ability to redo proves futile.

As the group makes their way to the Sanctuary in search of answers, Subaru has an unexpected encounter with the Witch of Greed—Echidna. Subjected to her untamed rhythm, he is forced to dive into the spirals of the past and future. At the same time, several mysterious threats set their sights on the Sanctuary, heralding a horrific fate for the hapless people trapped within.

Everlasting contracts, past sins, and unrequited love will clash and submerge into a river of blood in the second season of Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu. Pushed to the brink of hopelessness, how long will Subaru's resolve to save his loved ones last?

                              Re:Zero is about Subaru. He is the protagonist, the hero, and the center of the universe.
                              The term ""peak fiction"" often gets thrown around and has somewhat lost its meaning these days. Peak fiction, for me, is something that exemplifies masterful storytelling, world building and well written characters. The best of the best. The zenith of storytelling. Only a few series I've ever read/seen have reached those heights. Re:Zero is one of them and is in indeed, peak fiction.

                              Finally, the preliminary round has ended as the final episode just finished airing. What you see now is the updated and final version of my season 2 part 1 review, as promised.
                              Four years ago, Re:Zero took the world by storm with its fresh and innovative take on the isekai genre, and it rekindled my passion for the anime industry. Now in 2020, a year plagued with disaster and disappointment for many, it has returned with a much appreciated sequel. Amidst the cancellation and delay of a plethora of anime as well as the release of a slew of rather underwhelming others, it was refreshing to tune in to Re:Zero each week to follow its engaging narrative and compelling cast. 
                              Few shows in recent memory have been the center of as much controversy as Re:ZERO. While one side claims it to be an indisputable masterpiece, basing themselves on arguments like “Subaru’s realism” and the “deconstruction of the isekai genre”, the other is often of the opinion that it’s more spectacle than substance, repetitive shlock that often relies on shock factor more than anything. This division combined with 2016’s infamous “best girl” discourse has served to turn people off from any future installments of the series, and perhaps few can blame them for that.

                              It’s not often I find myself with the experience to’ve been on both sides of the anime fandom regarding a show as contentious as Re:Zero. Whether you’re among the uncontrollable super-fans who’ve adored Re:Zero for the last four years or among its haters who’ve vehemently despised it for just as long and decried it with just as much fervor, I bet there was never a time when you were in the opposing camp, and while I suppose my position isn’t quite so polarizing, it’s definitely an awkward middle-ground of its own. What’s worse is the fact my opinions on the show as I knew it were

"Fuu Kasumi is a young and clumsy waitress who spends her days peacefully working in a small teahouse. That is, until she accidentally spills a drink all over one of her customers! With a group of samurai now incessantly harassing her, Fuu desperately calls upon another samurai in the shop, Mugen, who quickly defeats them with his wild fighting technique, utilizing movements reminiscent to that of breakdancing. Unfortunately, Mugen decides to pick a fight with the unwilling ronin Jin, who wields a more precise and traditional style of swordfighting, and the latter proves to be a formidable opponent. The only problem is, they end up destroying the entire shop as well as accidentally killing the local magistrate's son.

For their crime, the two samurai are captured and set to be executed. However, they are rescued by Fuu, who hires the duo as her bodyguards. Though she no longer has a place to return to, the former waitress wishes to find a certain samurai who smells of sunflowers and enlists the help of the now exonerated pair to do so. Despite initially disapproving of this idea, the two eventually agree to assist the girl in her quest; thus, the trio embark upon an adventure to find this mysterious warrior—that is, if Fuu can keep Mugen and Jin from killing each other.

Set in an alternate Edo Period of Japan, Samurai Champloo follows the journey of these three eccentric individuals in an epic quest full of action, comedy, and dynamic sword fighting, all set to the beat of a unique hip-hop infused soundtrack.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.5,8,105,87,901204,29714,"                              I caught Samurai Champloo as it aired back in 2004, and though I liked it enough, it didn’t impact me as much as I hoped it would. Though maybe that’s not entirely true, as the soundtrack did indirectly change my life, thanks to the composer Nujabes introducing me to instrumental hip hop and providing a soundtrack to my life for the next few years.
                                       Samurai Champloo is the latest work from Writer/Director Shinichiro Watanabe, who is most recognized for his work on Cowboy Bebop. One of the very few things Champloo and Bebop have in common is their great scores. Champloo mixes two subjects which would never be put in one sentence together, western hip-hop and eastern samurai swordplay. Yet the mixture comes out with a brilliant result. The fights scenes are hyped up with the speed and flow from the music and come out magnificent. But Champloo isn't all about fighting. Many things happen along the road for the          
                              Historical anime don't usually interest me, but when it's as tongue-in-cheek and as full of anachronisms as this, I'm not sure it really counts as a historical anime anymore.
                              For anyone who has watched Cowboy Bebop, they know that director Shinichiro Watanabe loves blending completely disparate elements together, be it science fiction, physical comedy, spaghetti Western, bebop jazz, or space epic, all into the same story.
                              Overview:
                              The premise is simple, three complete strangers drawn together by fate to embark on a long, very parlous journey across unfamiliar territory. However, it's not the plot which makes Samurai Champloo note worthy, but rather the characters themselves. There is a very strong relate-ability present in the main characters Jin, Mugen and Fuu; no matter who the viewer happens to be it's a more than safe bet they will instantly find common ground with at least one if not all three. This element within it's self is the very one which drives the series forward, it offers added interest and added suspense as each of

                              Samurai Champloo is frequently compared to Cowboy Bebop, but there's one thing that really sets it apart: the action. There wasn't anything bad about Bebop's action, but Champloo's action is among the best of any anime out there, especially among TV series. Though the main characters both use swords, they fight with wildly different styles (Mugen's use of shoes is particularly brilliant), and the fights against enemies with various weapons throughout the series all manage to make themselves interesting and different. Even if the rest of the series were terrible, it would be worth watching simply for the action.

                              This show could have been something special on the same page as such classics like Ninja Scroll(NOT THE TV SERIES), Samurai X OVAs, Rurouni Kenshin, or Basilisk.
                              Fuu is a young orphaned girl doing her best to survive while working in a teashop. But her world as she knows it begins to unravel the minute a wandering Okinawan swordsman by the name of Mugen slouches into the shop while the daikon's abusive son and his rude cronies are also having some fun. When Fuu becomes the victim of their nasty games, she immediately offers Mugen fifty dango if he saves her from them. At the same time, a masterless samurai named Jin bears witness to the daikon's cruelty and quickly intervenes, easily dispatching the daikon's &quot;best of the best&quot; guards.

"Graduation day is finally here, marking the end of Koyomi Araragi's eccentric high school life full of peculiar relationships with otherworldly beings.

However, Araragi is unexpectedly absorbed into his own bathroom mirror and trapped inside a bizarre world where everything he knows is completely reversed—the haughty Karen Araragi is shorter than usual, poker-faced Yotsugi Ononoki is brimming with emotion, and cute ghost girl Mayoi Hachikuji is a grown woman! But not everything is as it seems.

                              Let me say this from the start that I like the opening and ending of this movie so much. Studio Shaft has done a phenomenal job once again , specially now because it was theatrical release, our man Akiyuki Shinbo has done a great job, I will say even that overall its an improvement on the previous seasons. I liked those numbers that showed that how many cuts have been shown from the movie but this time the cuts were reversed because that right Araragi was in the mirror world (by the way this not a spoiler, its right there in the description). It was          
                              Perplexing has been the word to describe the world of the Monogatari series, and perplexing is how this final story of the series is gonna be.
                              So the only part I actually enjoyed where the last 5-10 minutes with Senjougahara. The problem is that:
                              I was more than happy with the ending of Owarimonogatari, so why continue the ending?  I feel as though it wrapped Araragi's story near perfectly and is the clear endpoint for his character. Well, it's Monogatari, so the answer is always fanservice. 
                              Realizing the fact that the main story has ended feels really weird because i didnt feel fulfilled (in the first place).
                              The Monogatari Series is a wild ride that I recommend to anyone who is looking for a series to really get invested in. It is full of deep character development and  fantastic dialogue that makes you really attached to each an every character and their stories and problems. Sure, the series has its slow points, but it always seems to pull me back in when I am starting to feel bored. Each character has an extremely unique story to tell, making them all enjoyable characters to watch. Throughout the story Araragi goes through a massive amount of problems and issues that he must solve,

Through an unfortunate series of tragedies, this is the path that cultivator Wei Wuxian experiments with during his teachings. His rise in power is accompanied by chaos and destruction, but his reign of terror comes to an abrupt end when the cultivation clans overpower him and he is killed by his closest ally.

Thirteen years later, Wei Wuxian is reincarnated in the body of a lunatic and reunited with Lan Wangji, a former classmate of his. This marks the beginning of a supernatural mystery that plagues the clans and threatens to disrupt their everyday life.

The plot is outstanding and it doesn't get tiring at all. Although it is a bit confusing at first it's not hard to understand and follow it. All the characters are very well drawn and portrayed. The animation is beautiful too, their movements are so smooth and it's almost hypnotizing to watch. The voice actors have done an amazing work showing the characters feelings (especially in the last episode). The music is truly magnificent as well. I really liked the fact that          
                              Hi, I'll make it short for you guys, put some headphones, and dive into it, the music, art and plot will do the rest.
                              This review won't go too much in depth with the points presented because I am trying to forget I ever watched this show. Seeing how there are no critical opinions available like anywhere on the interwebs, I thought I should do at least this much.
                              Where do I begin with? I was doing a search on pinterest for some traditional media pictures and some fanart of chinese illustrations and some pictures with long haired guys that looked like anime images would pop up again and again. So I finally decided to do a reverse image search. And I can't believe what a gold mine I stumbled across!! 
                              I was amazed to my ""Golden Core"" ! [SPOILER-FREE]
                              I cannot imagine going back to Japanese anime after this show. It has obliterated all current standards. The worldbuilding, storytelling, music, ART, plot....everything has surpassed my expectations. 
                              Now, I have never written any reviews on any anime whatsoever. However, Mo Dao Zu Shi has me sister stoked in such a good way that I cannot hold myself back from writing a review on this masterpiece.
                              so i watched this chinese ONA because one of my friends recommended it :D
                              The art is realistic but not to a point where it's annoying or far-fetched. The story is extraordinary with its tearful moments that brings jabs to the heart and overjoyed moments that make you want to jump off your seat. Mo Dao Zu Shi contains plenty action, some BL, comedy, drama, and heart-felt scenes that brought myself to tears. The sound is even greater than any anime i've ever watched in the past years with its exquisite music. Not just the music, the sound effects as well. The characters were my favorite of course due to the development of Wei Wuxian's character and the relationship          
                              I personally really enjoyed this show. The art was amazing the soundtrack was amazing and not only that but the story telling was extremely well done. Although most people will tend to avoid this show because it contains BL. I really think that people who usually avoid BL, can actually watch this because the story is so amazing and you can somewhat ignore the aspect of it being BL and pass it more as bromance. So whether you are into BL or not I think this donghua was very well made and I really enjoyed it(literally got me obsessed lol).           
                              Mo Dao Zu Shi is absolutely awesome! The story is very interesting with amazing plot structures. The setting of fiction ancient China creates a tons of charming experiences to the audience. 
                              Im going to start off by saying, this is the first review i've ever written, you'll surely find grammar mistakes along the way and maybe silly reasonings, but bear with me!
                              Long ago, the cultivation clans lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when the Wen clan attacked. Only the Yiling Patriarch, master of harnessing negative energy, could stop them. But when the world needed him most, he went kinda batshit crazy, killed a bunch of his friends and exploded. Now, my brother and I have found the new Grandmaster of Demonic Cultivation, a lunatic named Mo Xuanyu. And while his fluting skills are great, he's got a long way to go before he's ready to save anyone.

                              I can't decide if  I like or hate this anime. The plot is intriguing/interesting and so is the world, there is also some gay or hinted at gay I think?(which is always nice)."

This is the question posed by Berserk, pitting humanistic free will against nihilistic predestination.  More intimately, this is the battle of human suffering in the wake of divine fate and the ambition of one's fellow man.  Set in a medieval world of strife, vast green lands and blue skies obscure the supernatural demonic powers lurking in unseen shadows.

                              Story: 10/10 Did you get the meat for my dog, boy!?
                              JUST a masterpiece ! A superb balance of everything! I don;t have the words to describe it! Everything is perfect - from the animation, through the marvellous soundtrack (a excellent work from Susumu HIRASAWA - Paranoia Agent, Paprika - just can\'t describe the emotional feeling from the music ) and finally to the magnificent story!
                              SUPPOSING that Griffith did nothing wrong — what then?  
                              You wondered why people overuse the word, “Epic” for anything and everything in the world, no matter how mundane and pointless it really is. This is especially the case in anime, as when people tell me to watch this show and how epic it is, I just don’t feel it and there is also the fact that I might’ve been underwhelmed by it and people seem to look at me weird by that. However, I knew about this anime by this time the newer Berserk movies were coming out and the fact that I listened to the DREAMcast episode 20 about Berserk, which was the          
                              Berserk is one of the best series I've ever seen, in a different league than most anime, which are too often filled with  pointless, arrogant ideals shouted by quasi-female, one-dimensional characters in dire need of a haircut.
                              It's amusing to look back at my first impressions after episode 1 of Berserk. I laughed at how corny the level of viol­ence was, gig­gled at the demons’ con­stant ref­er­ences to the tear­ing of flesh and crunch­ing of bones. The rest of the series was noth­ing like that first epis­ode. Totally dif­fer­ent in terms of tone, dir­ec­tion and pur­pose. And yet, in the grand story of Ber­serk, was every bit as import­ant as any other epis­ode in the rest of the series.
                              Fatigued, broken and injured, the remnants of The Band of The Hawk make haste after their once powerful and great leader; a shell of his former self. This man's dreams, hopes and work are all hopelessly destroyed, and, as he calls out for salvation, the sky is adorned with a deep, dark red tint that masks the entire area in the colour of blood. Bone-chilling laughter fills the cold, stifling air, as the mere mortals look on in despair at the grotesque and horrifying beasts before them. The eclipse has begun...
                              I think everyone who has saw this anime would come to the same conclusion, it is a masterpiece. 
                              Personally, I think this is just an advertisement for the manga, but for all the right reasons. Yes, I will acknowledge that it ends at a bad place but there are reasons for that. First off, when the anime ended, it was technically caught up with the manga so they really couldn&rsquo;t continue yet, but the bad news is, the anime still cuts out a lot and I felt they really rushed things through, but still covers the central basics with the characters and themes. I say what really brings people into the anime outside of the action is definitely the themes this anime has          
                              It's bad anime. It is below averange level for grown-up people.
                              Epic storytelling comes in different forms to guarantee that it can achieve its goal of telling an intriguing story filled with plenty of mythology around it. In the realm of high fantasy, there are enough to go around these days. However, it does not often happen to come across a series that wants to create an intriguing, tragic tale of betrayal and fate, but also tries to appeal to the action crowd with blood inducing carnage. In which case, Berserk fits perfectly with this description in with good precision.
                              What follows after is unknown, but what came before is a tale of friendship and of camaraderie. It is a tale of hardship and of sacrifice, fuelled by the pursuit of one man's dream. Unfortunately, it's a tale without a proper conclusion. You ever watched something that had you completely engrossed with what was going on and then RIGHT when it gets to the most soul-crushing and depressing part, it suddenly ends? No? Well too fucking bad. That's what the deal is with Berserk. This is my third time watching the anime, and even though I've forgiven virtually EVERYTHING else that was wrong with this          
                              Now, you may or may not be able to tell by looking at this show that it’s about as ugly and grizzled as its demon villains. The animation is bare-bones in this show, absolutely putrid sometimes, and guess what? I almost don’t care, because the story is an absolute masterpiece. Equal parts political intrigue and fantastical nightmare, it sucks you in like few stories can. If I may be hoity-toity for a moment, it reminds me of the great Greek tragedies and blood-stained Roman myths where grandiose characters with small tragic flaws would be lifted to the heights of great godhood before inevitably crashing down          "
"Eighth-grader Shigeo ""Mob"" Kageyama has tapped into his inner wellspring of psychic prowess at a young age. But the power quickly proves to be a liability when he realizes the potential danger in his skills. Choosing to suppress his power, Mob's only present use for his ability is to impress his longtime crush, Tsubomi, who soon grows bored of the same tricks.

In order to effectuate control on his skills, Mob enlists himself under the wing of Arataka Reigen, a con artist claiming to be a psychic, who exploits Mob's powers for pocket change. Now, exorcising evil spirits on command has become a part of Mob's daily, monotonous life. However, the psychic energy he exerts is barely the tip of the iceberg; if his vast potential and unrestrained emotions run berserk, a cataclysmic event that would render him completely unrecognizable will be triggered. The progression toward Mob's explosion is rising and attempting to stop it is futile.

                              Have you ever watched an anime that had 12 episodes that had very interesting visuals, great characters (and development) and story that was charming in its own nature? No? Well Mob Psycho 100 is right here for you to watch! 
                              Funny, whimsical, charming, and oddly enough, thoughtful. 
                              Last year, One Punch Man rose to popularity and became of the most mainstream and popular anime of the current decade. However, the mangaka of One Punch Man also had another really good series that not many have heard about, Mob Psycho 100. With an adaptation for ONE’s other series, Mob Psycho 100 was also able to generate a good amount of popularity, due to it living off of One Punch Man’s brand. Though there might be some similarities between the two series, Mob Psycho 100 is quite different One Punch Man in a lot of ways. And it manages to create its own name,          
                              (spoiler-free review)
                              Hype has always been a double-edged sword, Mob Psycho 100 (I’ll use the abbreviation MP100 for the following) and One Punch Man (OPM) being an almost perfect example of that exact statement. MP100 never got that much attention since it started airing in the Summer Season 2016, being outclassed in popularity by shows like Orange, Shokugeki no Souma S2 and the ongoing Re:Zero in that respect, at least at the start of Summer season. It was never hyped as ‘the best thing evar’, nor did it receive much negative backlash because of that. Unlike MP100’s relative lack of popularity, the author's other work One Punch          
                                When I went into Mob Psycho 100, the only thing I tried to expect was that I'd be watching a good comedy series paired with good action. We all know that One is a competent writer, but I decided that comparing this series' quality to One Punch Man would most likely be unfair. Little did I realize that this series would not only match the quality of One Punch Man, but add the things I felt were missing in it. Now even though I didn't want to compare this series to One Punch Man, I'll be doing a fair bit of that in          
                              Living by the shadow of One Punch Man, Mob Psycho 100 is probably the best anime that aired this season.  People are always complaining about how anime is always the same: boys that can travel back in time, tsundere protagonists or MMORPG worlds.
                              Mob Psycho 100 is based off of a manga by ONE. Yes, the same manga artist behind One Punch Man. The anime came out last year and was brought to us by Bones. Yes, the Soul Eater, Heroman, Wolf's Rain, etc... Studio. So, is this one okay like One Punch Man, better or worse? 
                              Mob Psycho 100 was LA's favourite anime of Summer 2016 and really it pulled it off, bringing in a two for two for ONE, the creator of One Punch Man, so what made Mob Psycho 100 another great like One Punch Man?, well it's a bit complicated to say the least...let's find out.
                              Wow... trying to come up with a compelling first sentence sure is hard... I'll just take a moment to myself before I start.
                              First thing is first, don't compare this to One Punch Man, in my opinion the first 2-3 episodes is kinda like a bad copy of OPM truth be told, but afterwards you see what Mob Psycho is all about and that is where you start to love it. 
                              This show is an absolute treat. As many already know, Mob Psycho 100, based on the web manga by ONE, shares many aspects with his One Punch Man series and the subsequent adaptation. However, while OPM is immensely entertaining due to the overwhelming strength of its protagonist, Mob Psycho 100 takes a more refined look at its characters and produces a show that not only reaches but surpasses the heights of its sister series.
                              For the people that expect another OPM from this. Don't get your hopes up. This is totally different.

"Nichijou primarily focuses on the daily antics of a trio of childhood friends—high school girls Mio Naganohara, Yuuko Aioi and Mai Minakami—whose stories soon intertwine with the young genius Hakase Shinonome, her robot caretaker Nano, and their talking cat Sakamoto. With every passing day, the lives of these six, as well as of the many people around them, experience both the calms of normal life and the insanity of the absurd. Walking to school, being bitten by a talking crow, spending time with friends, and watching the principal suplex a deer: they are all in a day's work in the extraordinary everyday lives of those in Nichijou. 

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.48,8,111,153,651311,18480,"                              Overview:
                              If I had to sum up all of Nichijou in one word, it would be ""beautiful."" As a slice of life, this anime can't be for everyone, as most people like to have a story that is actually driven by the plot. But even if you aren't into slice of life anime, there is something in Nichijou for everyone to enjoy.
                              Nichijou is to me, one of a kind. It emphasizes what seems to be the essence of slapstick comedy, but induces your favorite lighthearted scenario all within the same episode. If you were keen of Lucky Star, Azumanga Daioh, Hidamari Sketch, or Pani Poni Dash, then you would definitely know what I'm talking about. Except, Nichijou, or ""EveryDay"", takes a twist and turn every now and then to let you know this is not so ordinary, and from there, you're on a wonderful ride to a pure fun and blownout comedy. 
                              Great animation won't save this slice of life comedy from absolute failure.
                              Nichijou is a perfect example of a show that tries too hard to ride off the success of other shows. It's not that anything it does is bad, it's just that other shows do what Nichijou does much better.
                              How does one describe ordinary. Any dictionary will probably describe ordinary as ""Something that is commonly encountered, usual"" or something to that effect. So how does a show like Nichijou (which roughly translates to Regular Life) get a title like... well Nichijou. A show with robots, wigs, deer, and all manner of unusal things is anything but... ordinary right? Perhaps they titled it like this as a bit of a joke, to bounce off all the crazy stuff that is to come. But I think there is a little bit more behind the title than first meets the eye. Lets find out shall we?
                              Before I start with this review, I want to say: this is my first review. Maybe it'll be short for some of you people and probably, the only one I'm going to write. So please bear with me and with my lack of experience when it comes to review things. If there's something you'd like to tell me about the review itself or how wrong I am for not liking such “funny and original piece of art”, then you're free to do it, leaving the comments in my profile.

                              New generation anime sitcom has arrived…
                              ""A beautiful disaster-piece"" is what I use to describe Nichijou. While watching, I couldn't help but find myself to be so engaged, eyes literally almost glued to my screen. That's how great it was. There are many things I loved about Nichijou which makes it one of my personally favorites.. 
                              When your entire show relies on gag comedy, and the majority of that gag comedy relies on subverting expectations, and most of those subverted expectations end with something random rather than clever, you've taken comedy and beat it down to its worst form.  The lolrandom form, which is the form that Nichijou loves best.  It's a sketch show, and all sketch shows are bound to be hit-or-miss.  Nichijou is just a lot of misses with maybe a hit or two sprinkled in every five episodes.  Maybe it's just my sense of humor, but a lot of the humor relies too heavily          
                              Nichijou is a comedic manga/anime/PSP game written by Keiichi Arawi. It's had very limited releases outside of Japan with the North American versions even being canceled for reasons I don't know. The question is, were audiences thankfully spared or are they missing out on something? I'm going to examine the anime to find out.
                              Nichijou means ""Everyday Normal (Life)"", and this anime is nothing close to that.
                              Being a KyoAni project, the first thought that came into my mind when I saw the cover art for Nichijou was that it is going to be a comedy/slice of life filled with cute girls doing cute things. Luckily, there's much more to this anime. Nichijou is a sketch comedy, with a sprinkle of slice of life, set in a junior high school. While the title in English is ""My Ordinary Life"", Nichijou is full of the extraordinary. 
                              This review will be hard to write, as I will probably laugh at certain parts."
"J-pop idol group CHAM! has spent the last two years entertaining its fans. Sadly, all good things must come to an end, and CHAM! must see one of its members, Mima Kirigoe, leave the group to pursue her acting career. While Mima's choice is met with a mixed response, she hopes her fans will continue to support her.

However, Mima's life begins to change drastically after her departure from the group. Wanting to shed her pop-idol image, she takes on a role in a crime drama series, and her career as an actress gradually becomes more demanding and taxing for both Mima and her manager, Rumi Hidaka. To add to Mima's growing unease, an obsessed fan who is incapable of accepting that Mima has quit being an innocent idol, begins stalking her; a new anonymous website begins to impersonate her life with intricate detail; and CHAM! also appears to be doing better without her. One by one, each disturbing development drives Mima to become increasingly unhinged and unable to distinguish reality from fantasy.

                              Perfect Blue centers around a small pop star's transition into the film business.  Her life is turned upside down by her new, less innocent work, a stalker, and several murders that occur around her.  Much like Millennium Actress and Paprika, this is another Satoshi Kon film that blurs the lines between reality and delusion, only to a more suspenseful effect in Perfect Blue.  Mima, the ex-pop star turned actress is filming a TV murder drama throughout most of the movie that eerily mirrors the murders that are occurring around her.  It is often unclear if a scene is playing out on          
                              I'm a big Kon fan, i love Milennium Actress and Paprika.
                              Anyone familiar with Satoshi Kon is probably also already familiar with what would make this movie intriguing. His works have a real appeal to fans of the surreal. It can be very mentally and visually stimulating. I've enjoyed other things by Kon, and I was really beginning to like this movie, however, by the end I had several problems with this film...
                              Why is it that I always end up watching movies like this at 4 am, in my room, alone?
                              “Excuse me… Who are you?”
                              There's a reason why this movie is called Perfect Blue. ""Perfect"" because the movie itself is a masterpiece and ""Blue"" because it is truly a dementia that will make you fall into despondent of figuring out what's actually happening.

Behind this there is a lot of hard work involved, and suddenly quitting being an idol can have an emotional impact upon the fans, which can lead to jealousy and contempt, or even murder. Perfect Blue is a psychological thriller anime which delves into the dark side of the entertainment industry, in particular that of the idol and acting section.

Make no mistake, it’s been on my radar for over a decade but I’ve often felt intimidated by the premise of this film, not feeling up to the challenge. But as with all good things, they come to those who wait and since I have Perfect Blue on Blu-ray and was well in the mood to watch it, finally maturing I finally thought that tonight was as good as any to pop it in and give it a spin…and boy          "

                              You can say I have bad taste in anime or that I'm simply following another persons preference. To be honest, I really don't care. This movie was great and that's all I have to say. 
                              This is a movie, which means it can only holds one plot. And that's may disappoints some people, but the hardcore Otaku fans will enjoy this regardless the fact the main subject isn't about comicet. 
                              This is the best as I really expected, because the TV series is also very guaranteed

                              First I want to say a big thank you to the producers, development studio, and narrators who created this story, Saekano Movie. I was very happily surprised and my feeling somehow felt that this was a masterpiece that I had been waiting for, yeah, maybe about 3 to 4 years I waited until Saekano Fine finally aired on the screen or maybe your favorite cinema.
                              SHORT SUMMARY: MAINSTREAM, CRINGEY, ANKWARD BUT I LOVE IT. 
                              for the animation, it's so cool. I think the opening was used motion graphic or 3d movement that the first time i see that thing in anime. I love the sound design, left and right is very pronounced. 
                              I absolutely despised every single minute of this film.

                              If you do not want to spoil the impression of the series, then it is better not to watch this movie. I'll start with the pros: the drawing is not bad, without jambs, but also nothing impressive. That's it, there are no more pluses."
"Centuries ago, mankind was slaughtered to near extinction by monstrous humanoid creatures called titans, forcing humans to hide in fear behind enormous concentric walls. What makes these giants truly terrifying is that their taste for human flesh is not born out of hunger but what appears to be out of pleasure. To ensure their survival, the remnants of humanity began living within defensive barriers, resulting in one hundred years without a single titan encounter. However, that fragile calm is soon shattered when a colossal titan manages to breach the supposedly impregnable outer wall, reigniting the fight for survival against the man-eating abominations.

After witnessing a horrific personal loss at the hands of the invading creatures, Eren Yeager dedicates his life to their eradication by enlisting into the Survey Corps, an elite military unit that combats the merciless humanoids outside the protection of the walls. Based on Hajime Isayama's award-winning manga, Shingeki no Kyojin follows Eren, along with his adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman and his childhood friend Armin Arlert, as they join the brutal war against the titans and race to discover a way of defeating them before the last walls are breached.

You can understand the anime very well even without having read the manga. However, SNK isn't understood by many because it's a psychological manga .. SNK isn't just a succession of empty and meaningless clashes and, of uncontrolled violence, stereotyped heroes who fight the bad (like Bleach). Here are shown the darkest sides of the human psyche with great mastery: the desire to be the best but can't do it, the

                                        Every once in a while, and even more frequently now than in the past, an anime appears that is completely and unequivocally shrouded in layers upon layers of hype and popularity from the anime community. It's the show that's on everyone lips, as well as everyone's TV screens. In the Fall of 2011, The Future Diary created an exceptional level of hype that had not been seen for quite some time. When the Summer of 2012 rolled along, it was time for Sword Art Online to take the spotlight, and its own popularity grew to          
                              Shingeki no Kyojin... Where do I start?
                              I started watching Shingeki no Kyojin a year ago, almost to the day that I am writing this. So I figured I would write a review on what has grown to be one of my favourite series of all time.
                              Attack on Titan is a particularly unique case for me. As such, my review needs to be broken up to properly analyze it. 
                              So what on earth? What have I done?
                              Let's get straight to it! Shingeki no Kyojin is an incredibly gripping, action packed show, and it is certainly capable of converting non-anime watchers. When you begin to understand the plight of humanity versus the titans, you'll quickly begin to realize that this is a show of epic proportions - essentially it is an inter species war: and violence comes hand in hand with this theme, so squeamish viewers might want to look elsewhere.
                              This anime made my mouth open wide for longer than 5 seconds more than a handful times. This is the type of world where more people get killed than the entirety of the A Song of Ice and Fire series. It exists in a timeless universe – not in the past, present or future of our world, but in a pocket universe where Titans existed long before the existence of machines. In this world, machines were not invented to improve humanity’s lifestyle, but for the continuous existence of humanity itself.
                              The hype of 2013 leading to an ending that closed off lots of action and questions throughout its run. With an anime that has a lot of hype, comes a lot of conflict between haters and people who genuine enjoy the anime. Shingeki no Kyojin is an anime that made peaks in sales and getting fans world wide, but is it really worth watching? 
                              Shingeki no Kyojin is an amazingly written story with a very dark premise and a lot of action. This is definitely not a series for the faint of heart, especially those with fears of man-eating giants that don't even have the decency to kill you before they eat you (sometimes). The story keeps you guessing as it progresses, there's a new reveal that completely destroys what you thought you knew and makes you wonder just how far the rabbit hole goes. The characters are very relatable and you really do want to see them succeed. What makes this series unique however is the protagonists very          
                              It's nice to have an anime this popular that isn't just tsundere school rom-com no' 10746 for a change. But does that alone make said anime great? No, not really.
                              If you’re an anime or manga patron, you’ve more than likely heard of, if you haven’t already read or seen, a series entitled Shingeki no Kyojin (Attack on Titan). Based on the popular manga, Shingeki no Kyojin had been made into an anime in 2013, that had literally taken the entire world by storm. It's even been airing on American Television alongside other popular shows such as One Piece and Naruto. It’s popularity is getting to the point where it’s damn near impossible to say the word “anime” without someone bringing up Shingeki no Kyojin. But is Shingeki no Kyojin worth the hype? 
                              This will be my first ever review on this website, and I figured it best to start with the one series most fresh in my mind.  Attack on Titan was one of the most rewarding anime experiences I've ever had.  Unique premise, serious characters and a vivid soundtrack and art style make the first season of this show one to remember.  I will keep this review spoiler free, as to not ruin the experience for anyone else.
                              It pains me in a way to not give Attack on Titan anything but a 10. I completely understand why this show got so popular so fast. I also understand why everybody is impatiently waiting for season 2. I want to say that it is really as flawless as people say it is."

                              The final season for the Monogatari series...I never thought I'd reach this point. This obviously isn't the final show for the series. There's still the 2nd cour for Owarimonogatari, a bunch of Koyomi arcs and Kizumonogatari.
                              To start with the good news, Owarimonogatari is a breath of fresh air in this rather stale year in animes. The bad news? While its second half provides hints of what was the aftermath of Kizumonogatari film to be aired next year, it is one of the worse arcs in the Monogatari universe.
                              Story + Overview 10 / 10
                              Love it, hate it, indifferent to it, or once-loved-then-hated-now-extremely indifferent to it, Owarimonogatari (literally 'end story', though the series doesn't conclude here) will most likely meet your expectations of the long-running light novel adaptation. For me, that means occasionally witty dialogue shoehorned with ecchi, traces of pedophilia, and genuinely interesting ideas muffled by execution. And yup, it's got all three. NisiOisiN really knows how to keep his writing consistent! 
                              Owarimonogatari is the telling of two stories. The first one is about Oikura Sodachi, which is a long lost friend of Koyomi Araragi; the other is about Shinobu Oshino. 
                              Owarimonogatari 1/Formula Ougi/ Sodachi Riddle/ Sodachi Lost:
                              (9.0/10)
                              (This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)
                              Many people who gave this monogatari series or owarimonogatari a lower than average rating, let me say this. The meaning of ""owari"" or the prefix name of this monogatari means the resolution or the end of something. By this sense, many of the monogatari that we saw with its prefix name tells you, and predetermine what you are about to see, within those monogatari series that will entails as its main theme or topic of the anime's discussion or introductory standpoints, until it meets it resolution or the end of that specific monogatari series. And if you notice something about this owarimonogatari series. Both shinobu's          
                              Now this installment of the Monogatari series was fairly odd, since it tried to incorporate new characters as well as one old character that we don't know too much about. The show is split up into two stories, both being six episodes long. Although both stories are under the same title (Owarimonogarati) they don't really have anything to do with each other. 
                              Here we are with my fanboy review of another installment of the monogatari series. This series definitely stands out from heaps of other anime with very few series being like it. At first people might go into this series thinking its supposed to be something super artsy with hidden messages and metaphors everywhere but honestly all it does is take a fairly generic story and take a new approach with it. People criticize this series for its lack of character development and plot. A lot of these people  watched 3 episodes and quit. Character development in this series is actually very interesting. The main          
                                    I'll start off by saying that I initially had a higher opinion of Owarimonogatari in the first hour or so after I finished it.  While I still really enjoyed the series overall, my impression weakened after I gave it a bit more thought.  While many reviews break this show up into 3-4 mini storylines, there are really only two true arcs.  The first one revolving around the mysterious background of Oikura Sodachi was far superior to the second arc centering on Shinobu and the reincarnation of her first kin, and I'll explain why in my story          
                              I was highly disappointed with Owarimonogatari. In my opinion it was a major step down compared to the rest of the series/stories. I thought if I gave it more time that maybe there would be a better chance of me liking it and changing my rating, however to my disappointment it did just the opposite. 
                              Owarimonogatari is yet another installment in the adaptation of the Monogatari LN series. This follows 3 stories, two of which focus on one character exclusively and resolve in a way that's both satisfactory and at the same time, kind of disappointing. The VA's of the focal female characters are doing their own openings with exception given (yet again) to Maaya Sakamoto. Decent Black strikes the nerves a funny bit the first few listens, but it soon becomes catchy and you find yourself obsessively looking it up on youtube. Mathemagics on the other hand, has a rather James Bond-esque feel to it that works really well          "

                              And that's it, the end of a journey that lasted 7+ years is finally here and as a lot of anime end, it ended in a disappointment. 
                              I will preface this by saying that I'm not a fan of dramas but I do find one occasionally that is written so well that I actually enjoy it, so take that how you will.
                              To me Oregairu has always been the Rick and Morty of anime. It's pretentious, it's pseudo deep, it wants to be so intelligent and clever yet fails to do so. For the life of me I have tried to understand what people see in this series besides waifus and I really can't. Oregairu Kan offers no real change in that regard, other than more Yui, which for me is the only reason I didn't give this a 1/10. 
                              Now that the journey for the genuine article has ended, the progress from the previous season was severed. For the plot have went off the rails, and devolved to it's weaknesses, dragged to death, the substance has abandoned ship. For what value has left? When it's was already spent. What words could have been said, was tainted, it's pretentious already. A social commentary, as everyone perceived, but rarely seen for what it really is, a mirror hidden in plain sight, a work of self reflection for it's own audience. It should have ended earlier already, nothing else is left to said, the melodrama has made          
                              This review covers the entirety of oregairu series (this means that there may be spoilers for those unfamiliar with the series)	

                              Oregairu finishing its final season was certainly something else. Brain’s Base and feel. both did a phenomenal job when it came to adapting their seasons, and I hope that most of the people reading this can agree with that. While I haven’t been with the Service Club for their 7-year animated run, the 5 years wait between the two feel. seasons was certainly worth it in the end. Well, for the most part.
                              A rather disappointing season which didn't live up to its predecessors. Climax is no climax, and is lacking and left me unsatisfied.
                              All good things must come to an end and here we are, the final season of My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU Climax. You know that feeling when you finally move away from your closest friend since childhood? That’s the kind of feeling I got after this final season concluded.
                              Well I finally finished watching Oregairu today and i gotta say... I HATED IT!!! 
                              As someone who had their fair share of drama and romance during my high school days, I’ll provide my two cents on this finale season. 
                              TLDR: A very poor buildup to what is a generally good ending to an outstanding anime series. Sprinkled with some emotional moments supported by the amazing production done by Studio feel. I will miss this series for the experience for the foreseeable future.
                              Look I am going to keep this short and simple. This season, didn't live upto my expectations, that doesn't mean its a bad anime. I still consider the season 1 and 2 are far superior and interesting. Season 1 has the car accident issue, season 2 has predominant Hachiman way of solving things and moreover season 2 made me cry at a point but season 3 has no major story (which is even worse since it is very predictable) to keep me interested and I didn't even feel anything from the characters.
                              This review will be about s3 ultimately but is heavily based on the experience of the series as a whole."
Third season of Golden Kamuy.,8.46,8,119,1706,78006,593,"                              AHHH...Golden Kamuy, the series that never stops giving both its world and characters rest (even with the ample amounts strewn throughout), and keeping us on our toes each and every time. Now into the 3rd season after a 2-year wait, and the ""peak fiction"" levels of enjoyment and thrill has never dipped once, even with its hilarious slice-of-life comedy that always proclaims the provocatively memorable ""HINNA, HINNA!"" catchphrase. If you're reading this review and watching this spectacular series for the very first time (at least this installment anyways), please start from the very beginning and experience the awesomeness that is this historical action-adventure series that's          
                              Honestly Golden Kamuy is the best anime of this season for me.Season 3 was hype and it sure deliver the hype more than i expected.
                              Another great season of a criminally under-watched anime.
                              GOLDEN KAMUY NEVER DISAPPOINTS
                              How the F*CK do you get people to watch Golden Kamuy?
                              Golden Kamuy is one of those animes that gets better and better by each season. The surprising part is that it started great from the very beginning and it has never lost its steam since then. The ending of the last season was one of the highlights of the series to that point, and yet, I had some doubts after the reconfiguration of the parties we follow in this part, how the story will work when you separate Sugimoto and Asirpa, one of the strongest features of the series? to my surprise (and ignorance), it worked extremely well, so I was happy to be rightfully          
                              Third season of golden Kamuy and I love how the animation level is maintained and all the feeling it transmits. Very nice apart we have a very nice and good reunion. The season is good because you see more pasts of the protagonist's father and you better understand who he is because he happens. And what will happen? I look forward to season 4.
                              Let me start off with saying: Golden Kamuy is just getting better and Better and BETTER! This show is such an underrated anime that deserves more credit and needs to be watched by weebs more.
                              For all intents and purposes, I didn’t expect a piss joke to be the thing in this season that got me cracking up the most. Now, I’m not against it or anything, but in a show about war, ethnic minorities, history, and a surprising amount of gay overtones, ‘urine’ was not the thing I was expecting to get me bursting this time around. (Pun not intended)
                              God Golden Kamuy does nothing but gets better and better!
                              Another great season of Golden Kamuy! Let's get right into the anime basics.
                              I think at begging it's hard to recognize Golden Kamuy as a great anime, when the series does not appears to be taken seriously... But, just wait untill watch more few episodes to start rethinking that!
                              I legitimately have no idea how this season has more score than the first two, I don't even know how this get more than 7 stars with just dumbly chasing for 11 episodes and just let the trouble ran away in the last episode, except more people are free this year so the standard was lower.
                              What can I say except, woow with rapid hand-clapping 
                              Simply it's a great anime, one of the best.."

Long ago, a Mushi of terrifying power threatened to extinguish all life. The Minai clan of Mushishi were born from those who stopped this malevolent force, their members bound by duty to serve as retainers to the Karibusa family, within whom the Mushi remains sealed. The Mushishi Ginko is given a job request from Tanyuu Karibusa: oversee the work of the head of the Minai clan, Kumado Minai, in investigating an abandoned village where dead wood and even houses spring back to life as flourishing plants.

Though the Minai clan are oddly ruthless among Mushishi, even more peculiar is their widespread dull character, with little appreciation for beauty or sentiment. Tanyuu believes there is more to this trend than meets the eye. Ginko aims to answer her curiosity as he follows Kumado into a ""Path of Thorns,"" a place where Mushi flow from their own strange sources into the world of the living. Rare and deadly varieties of Mushi lurk in these depths, along with the secret nature of the Minai clan's resolve to their ancient task.

"Nana Komatsu is a helpless, naïve 20-year-old who easily falls in love and becomes dependent and clingy to those around her. Even though she nurses ambitious dreams of removing herself from her provincial roots and finding her true calling, she ends up traveling to Tokyo with the humble reason of chasing her current boyfriend Shouji Endo.

Nana Osaki, on the other hand, is a proud, enigmatic punk rock vocalist from a similarly rural background, who nurtures the desire to become a professional singer. Putting her career with a fairly popular band (and her passionate romance with one of its former members) firmly behind her, she boards the same train to Tokyo as Nana Komatsu.

Through a fateful encounter in their journey toward the metropolis, the young women with the same given name are brought together, sparking a chain of events which eventually result in them sharing an apartment. As their friendship deepens, the two attempt to support each other through thick and thin, their deeply intertwined lives filled with romance, music, challenges, and heartbreaks that will ultimately test their seemingly unbreakable bond.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.46,8,121,330,408105,17166,"                              One of the things I like to see the most in anime is how they portray relationships. I&rsquo;m a sucker for romance, but I hate the cheesy stuff you usually see in typical shoujo anime. Sometimes you&rsquo;ll find an anime with realistic characters, with the typical flaws of human nature, and usually people love them. We can identify with them. Like in Evangelion many people who have dealt with depression could identify with Shinji (in some levels&hellip;). 
                              Nana is one of those acclaimed anime that everyone seems to know the existence of, but very few people have ever actually watched. The fact that it’s almost 50 episodes long is a bit of a turn-off in of itself, but even the people who have seen it barely discuss the thing anymore. Very few “favorite anime” lists that I’ve read actually include it. It’s up there with Great Teacher Onizuka, Hajime no Ippo, and most of the Major anime in terms of high-ranking MAL darlings that the majority of MAL users will go “oh yeah, I’ve heard how good this thing is. Better put          
                              The background of NANA feels like an endless white night. Things seem to be continuously in motion; beginnings and endings wrapped up in an infinite wave of falling snowflakes waiting to melt into each other. The forefront sits in perpetual twilight; characters seem to be eclipsed by their own shadows with barely enough to catch a glimpse of who they are. The entire landscape depicts the frigidity of life rising from frosty gales to a calmer ether, only to revert to stormier lands. Movement here isn’t linear. Nothing is. NANA, as a whole, is pure kinetics; an explosion of emotional energy circling, clashing and always          
                              Ai Yazawa did it again.
                              Gotta say, this is one of the most disappointing series to show up in the MAL top list. On the one hand, I found most of the characters really boring. Especially ""Hachiko"" who I couldn't sympathize with at all, and found I felt no pity for her at all in her fate. The other Nana was somewhat better, but overall, all of the female characters come across as being incredibly weak people who have nothing else in life to live for but to succumb to their men. Jun strikes me as the only one with any inner strength but alas she's a side character we          
                              NANA is a Shoujo, Slice of Life, Romance, Drama about the joys, the pain and the struggles that come with the endeavour known as love and romance. If you enjoy your shoujo or romance then NANA is a must see.
                              Shoujo is probably the last word I would use to describe this anime.  
                              NANA is a regrettably incomplete work. It takes viewers on a journey with an intriguing destination, aggravates them with rocky bumps along the way, and then unceremoniously abandons them on the roadside in the middle of nowhere. The story unfolds in reasonably entertaining ways but is too frequently hamstrung by inadequate build and progression with regard to many core characters, and when combined with the abrupt conclusion to the series, bewildered viewers at the very end may be asking themselves, ""Huh? That's it?"", as they lament over NANA's wasted potential and wonder what could have been.
                              I went into this series with no idea of what to expect. I read the synopsis, and it sounded okay, but it does not do justice to the show at all. 
                              ""Nana, how come being happy and making your dreams come true are two different things? Even now, I still don't know why..""
                              Nana has tremendous characters, tremendous art, and a soundtrack that's top tier in every way. If only I'd known how this series ended before I sat through all 47 episodes I never would have bothered in the beginning.
                              Love triumphs the human soul in ways we can’t fathom, and how we can contain it also remains unexplained. Whether it is love in a romantic or friendly fashion, it has always been one of the most sought out themes in stories in every medium imaginable. We are used to the idealistic form of love with many tropes and literary devices, but now we’ve grown to appreciate the “realistic” types of romance. The type I  am refering to is a romance that tries to portray the reality we live in rather than what we hope it will be. Nana can speak for itself as          
                              Yes, I was initially drawn to NANA by Paradise Kiss. After having watched all of ParaKiss in about a day, I was left craving more of that special flavor of drama and the striking art style. However, I was not prepared for the treat I was in for when watching NANA.
                              What can I say about this anime...
                              Nana for me was never a recommendation nor was it and anime I saw discussed on every forum, it was litarilly an anime/manga I stumbled upon one night whilst looking for a cute romantic series. I think that was a really lucky night. "

Now 17 years old and the boss of his own gang, Ash begins investigating the mysterious ""Banana Fish""—the same two words his older brother, Griffin, has muttered since his return from the Iraq War. However, his inquiries are hindered when Dino sends his men after Ash at an underground bar he uses as a hideout.

At the bar, Skip, Ash's friend, introduces him to Shunichi Ibe and his assistant, Eiji Okumura, who are Japanese photographers reporting on American street gangs. However, their conversation is interrupted when Shorter Wong, one of Ash's allies, calls to warn him about Dino. Soon, Dino's men storm the bar, and in the ensuing chaos kidnap Skip and Eiji. Now, Ash must find a way to rescue them and continue his investigation into Banana Fish, but will his history with the mafia prevent him from succeeding?

Not only are these terms incorrectly applied to the work, but they also do not cut at the meat of what Banana Fish is.

                              It is well known, even mentioned in the first two episodes, that Banana Fish borrows its odd name from a classic short story written by JD Salinger called “A Perfect Day for Banana Fish.” What is somewhat less noted, however, is how perfectly this reference captures the theme and style of the manga and anime series. Salinger’s story tells of the suicide of Seymour Glass, a World War II vet. The most famous passage of the story features a young man telling a young girl of the “very tragic life” of the Bananafish species who enter a “banana hole” as “very-ordinary looking fish” and gorge

                              There are always some tv series, movies, cartoon, anime that people can say that they are not your typical stuff. That these are truly exceptional from what we have been getting in the past. That this is something unique and nothing else is like it.
                              I will not forgive anyone who gives this anything less than a 10.

                              Banana Fish is a 2018 anime based off of a manga that ran from the mid 80s to mid 90s. The original manga was written by Yoshida Akimi. Who I am not even slightly familiar with. The anime version was handled by MAPPA. The same studio behind rubbish like Kakegurui and Sakamichi no Apollon. But they also worked on Dororo. So, we have to give them some credit. 
                              I haven’t cried actual tears over fictional characters in a while but damn. I’m a mess.
                              I stumbled upon this anime not expecting what I was about to watch. Truthfully, it does not appeal very much to the majority of the audience. I also had a hard time getting hooked in the first episode since the complexity was too much for me- but, that's just what makes this a good anime. The foundation is very organized, stories connect well, different factors add up and it balances everything.
                              This is the first time I write a review...cause I love this Anime so much
                              This is not your basic, instant satisfaction, mainstream anime. Looking for fanservice? Fast paced episode stories? Your modern formulaic anime? No? Then this isn't the place to be."

Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure Stardust Crusaders: Second Season (or Egypt Arc) provokes the question of what the audience wants to see next. The first half of the adaptation already showed plenty of Stands ranging from one that can attack via reflective surfaces, a parasitic being that can enter a victim’s brain, or even a Stand that can attack in dreams with Freddy Krueger style. The answer is simple really. It continuously deliver a source of imaginative and entertainment that almost anyone will find entrancing.

                              The second season of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders is the when all the real stuff of the 3rd part of JoJo manga happens. 
                              The JoJo series is a very peculiar beast, one ridden with overly muscular super humans, flamboyantly stunning poses, and over-the-top battles that are sure to fill your battle shounen needs. All of these elements are turned up to 11 for Part 3, also known as Stardust Crusaders. While the first season of Stardust Crusaders helped get the ball rolling, the second season had me fully invested, excitedly awaiting my dose of weekly JoJo tomfoolery and badassery.
                              Jojo Bizarre Adventure Part 3: Second Season is pretty much the same thing that you experienced in the first season, however unlike the first season where practically every episode the group had a new enemy to fight, on this season they basically put 2 episodes for each new enemy, which makes the pace of the episodes much better than the first season.

                              The 2D animation is mediocre. The 3D animation is awful.
                              This is one of the most awesome anime ever created. 
                              Now I'm going to let you know in advance that Stardust Crusaders is my favorite manga of all time. So I'm a little biased toward it and it's anime adaptation but I am going to write a review to the best of my abilities taking this into consideration.
                              The story
                              TL;DR: The second season to Stardust Crusaders fails to keep one interested as the creativity of the end of Part 3 plummets, and makes the viewer both lethargic and bored. I would physically only recommend this season to people who desire to finish up Stardust Crusaders, but one could skip to the last 6 episodes to save the trouble of wasting a great deal of time. 
                              Another part/season of Jojo completed and added to the books! Let's get right into the anime basics.

The second season to part 3 stardust crusaders is the most satisfying conclusion to any Jojo part and many shonen series out there, we continue following our fellow crusaders across the Nile and finally arrive at Cairo in Egypt, stardust crusaders 2nd season is one of the best jojo parts around and is a greatly satisfying conclusion to the Brando and Joestar rivalry, but does it          "

Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru (also known as Run With the Wind) is an actual book adaptation and features competitive running as part of its plot. Like most competitive sports, the show delivers storytelling to feature the journey of characters to accomplish their goals. Thankfully, this show delivers a promise that won’t leave you disappointed.
                              Anyone who has ever run knows that it sucks. Why waterboarding is a thing when treadmills exist is a complete mystery to me. I guess even the KGB had its limit on how fucked up their torture methods were. Anyhoo, Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru --  Run with the Wind -- is a story about people who are literally the epitome of masochism and, as weird as it may sound, actually enjoy running. I was expecting a psychological series going in depth with this pain = pleasure thing, but turns out our series relies on fujobaiting instead.
                              This show is underrated and a true gem.
                              We, humans, are always an interesting bunch of creatures. The difference between us humans from animals is that we have dreams. Dreams we set as our goals with. We chase down our dreams in the road of life, hoping to reach self-satisfaction and eternal happiness. Sadly, not everybody has a solid resolve to chase down their dreams, while some don’t have an end goal in their life, making the destination of life confusing and frustrating. But even with those odds, we still continue to move and keep on running in different directions. We still chase down the unknown answer we seek. This is what Kaze          
                              There are various aspects which have to be considered and come into play if we are talking about how a good anime should generally be like. That said, values and priorities in regards to a story and technical features may differ dependent on whom you ask. Well thought out plot, compelling characters or perhaps a focus on visual storytelling-you name it, all of us have preferences whose omnipresence ultimatively dictates our viewing habits and the enjoyment we receive out of something. There's still one attribute I view  as vital in order to appeal to the audience, namely heart and even more so when it          
                              Do you like running? So let's run together!

                              ""Haiji... this isn’t just your dream anymore... it’s our dream. 
                              I never really enjoyed any sports anime ever before watching this anime. The reason I never liked any sports show was simple, you see all any sports anime ever did was just putting so much effort on the sports itself that they forget to develop the characters who are the essential part of the anime(looking at Haikyuu, yuri on ice and free).
                              *Insert Stupid Quote"" Reviews nowadays are either filled with people having unpopular opinions and people liking them a lot, or some guy who writes an entire essay on why the show is a ""masterpiece."" Personally, I try and watch for enjoyment instead of picking apart every little thing within an anime. Anime, in my opinion should be watched with enjoyment rather than be slammed down by little tiny flaws that lowers the overall ""score.""
                              I'm not gonna lie to you guys okay? The ending was a bit rushed. Like, they could've pumped it to 25 episodes instead of 23. But maybe I'm only saying that because THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST ANIME I'VE EVER SEEN, AND I WANT MORE OF IT.
                              I don't like running,
                              Truly a masterpiece!
                              I've heard some positive murmurs about this anime and, after re-watching 'Haikyuu!!' for the tenth time, I decided to check out another Production I.G. anime. Maybe it wasn't such a great idea to watch a new sports anime right after watching one of my all time favorites, but my opinion would probably remain the same regardless: it was underwhelming. 
                              Running with the Wind will convince you that Japanese animation is indeed an artform, and is able to deliver unique experiences that could not have been replicated in any other artform. The writing is phenomenal, and is beautifully told with the help of choreography, cinematography, great voice acting and beautiful art."

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.45,8,125,422,327880,8150,"                              The relationship between man and machine is one often fantasized by artistes in diverse mediums. It’s a subject matter that fully intrigues and it's not hard to deduce why: it parallels heavily with our own society. The unwavering quench to advance collective technologies and the relative dependency on machines has drastically grown with the ages. Authors, artists, social critics, and scholars from all walks of life have adopted this framework and produced some of the most imaginative works that not only entertain, but step beyond the fictional realm to perhaps foreshadow a similar tomorrow not too far away…
                              Science Fiction has come a long way from stories involving the unknown reaches of space by the works of Jules Verne and H.G. Wells to stories that draw social implications of our society from famed authors George Orwell and Phillip K. Dick. There is little doubt that anime productions have tackled a lot beneath the limits of the genre ranging from Space Opera to Cyberpunk. One series that is often considered one of the most popular in the anime Sci-fi genre is Ghost in the Shell. After the success of the movie, directed by celebrated director Mamoru Oshii, we now have Ghost in the Shell:          
                              The 'Ghost in the Shell' movie was already a ground-breaking anime, inspiring such works as 'The Matrix' and 'Animatrix'; the TV series just takes it one step further.  
                              I haven't written any reviews for any anime so this may be a bit rocky. -.-
                              My view of anime, broadly speaking, might be called hopeless. I don't expect great things from the medium, and I am rarely given any reason to. Despite the insistence of the Anime News Network types, I don't think anime is particularly exceptional in the scope of its content, thematically or otherwise, and so the notion that these abstract forces (""moe,"" ""loli,"" ""otaku pandering,"" etc.) could ruin the entire medium borders on the absurd. Much of anime is very much genre fiction, and replacing one set of generic conventions and tropes with another is progress, if anything. With that said, I have no problem with good          
                              Previous to watching this, I had seen the famous Ghost in the Shell film from the 90s, as well as its sequel, several times. Not because I liked them though. Rather, due to my lack of willingness to accept that I truly did not like a lauded combination of philosophy, anime and cyberpunk; three things which I'm very fond of. It didn't make any sense. Despite some interesting, and obviously influential visuals, as well as some nice actions scenes, it seemed to me too much like the worst of European art films. It was unnecessarily slowly paced, and constantly making meaningless references to literature and          
                              The first season of Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex is absolutely brilliant.  For those who are not familiar with this series, it's a spinoff of the 1995 movie Ghost in the Shell, which has influenced many directors, not least of which are the Wachowski brothers who later created The Matrix.
                              There are several things I don't appreciate in Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex.
                              There is an abundance of American procedural cop shows nowadays in which most basically develop, or proceed, in the same manner with no real change either structural-wise or its characters, which may leave some viewers with no real impact. Then there is Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, which manages to create a much more intriguing story by having its setting in a cyberpunk future where complete mechanization of the human body has become a reality, and associated with it, crimes. Furthermore, world building is done magnificently through the numerous stand alone episodes. However, as I am no fan of this type of show,          
                              I've talked about Ghost in the Shell before. Both the first and second films. Now, it's time to look at the television installments, or at least one of them. Stand Alone Complex ran for a full year, from October 2002 to October 2003. So, it was released after the first film but before the second. Like the films, it was handled by Production I.G. It was written and directed by Kamiyama Kenji, who was not involved with either the first film or Innocence. What's his take on the material? Let's take a look and find out.
                              Everyone has their choice which are to be respected but to critique or review means to consider from an unbiased and logical point of view. Thus, due to my affiliation with the original movies and the characters, I would give it a 10  but if considered technically, there are things to be mentioned. Slight as they are, they will be mentioned. This review contains some spoilers.
                              Being myself a fan of this masterpiece made by Shirow Masamune, I can't find the words to tell you how much I enjoyed watching this wonderful series.
                              I once read that war is supposedly the most efficient way of pushing technology on a higher level. This doesn't seem to be too untrue in the universe of Ghost in the Shell since it already has four world wars in total behind itself - one being a nuclear one; hence the technology within itself has sky-rocketed to incredible dimensions.

I wondered if we had even seen the same movie. I, and seemly many who left the theatre did not leave angry; but we certainly were not raving about it being a masterpiece either. And in the whole theatre, only a single person cried. I overheard many conversations after the movie of it being ""okay"" and ""a lot of stuff didn't make sense"" and a few more criticisms. And I agree with them, this movie is no masterpiece. However, it is not bad either. So, here is my review

People on this site were giving it 9’s and 10’s and even one of my favorite musicians, Porter Robinson, tweeted about this movie and how good it was. And so, I selected this movie on a cozy Friday night with a bowl of soup and high expectations. 
                              This is the single-handed, worst anime movie I've ever watched. It would've done a whole lot better as a 12 episode anime vs. a 2 hour movie. 3? 4? Time skips? In two hours? I don't even think One Piece has had that many time skips and it's at 900+ episodes.
                              This will be a very in-depth review.
                              Review 22.11.2018: Sayonara no Asa ni Yakusoku no Hana wo Kazarou 
                                Maybe I  wrote for you obviously thing - but crisis of ideas was come. 
                              [Warming Spoilers]
                              I'll keep this short -- this movie was a huge let-down. The first quarter/half or so was at least fairly interesting and quickly took a downturn in the second act. If you want, you can stop reading here. 
                              Back when the first trailers dropped, I was pumped to watch this movie. The artwork looked so stunning, the premise felt original and full of potential. After waiting for half a year until it finally became available to watch, I have to say it didn’t live up to my hopes.
                              It's world building is done very well and very naturally and feels so legit and lived in. It's done in a way that's very show and don't tell which makes it so easy to fall into. It's a light fantasy setting, which is neat since you don't see that in anime very often. The CG is sparse but does kind of stand out, but still isn't the worst I've seen. There's some very nice animation on display here at times. The premise and some of the ideas I think that hey were going for are interesting, but the way it's presented is disjointed and some          
                              Maquia is a disappointment. If you enjoyed the movie, by all means go ahead and enjoy it - but to me it lacks the space to really drive its narrative and themes home, and as a result characters who should be interesting and compelling come off one dimensional and occasionally annoying as the thematic resolution falls flat. First things foremost, though: I have absolutely nothing against Mari Okada or her work on this project. She has her fair share of haters and her style is not always my thing, but she does a fantastic job with what she is given on this project. Thanks to          
                              this story is about the real meaning of the ""hebeol"" its the connector between the humans and its more than love it self if i see amazing thing in this movie its how he show the feelings between humans , in every death we know how they feel and after watching this movie it's feel like being reborn in another life with clear soul and lets start :)   "
"For centuries, humanity has been hunted by giant, mysterious predators known as the Titans. Three mighty walls—Wall Maria, Rose, and Sheena—provided peace and protection for humanity for over a hundred years. That peace, however, was shattered when the Colossus Titan and Armored Titan appeared and destroyed the outermost wall, Wall Maria. Forced to retreat behind Wall Rose, humanity waited with bated breath for the Titans to reappear and destroy their safe haven once more.

In Shingeki no Kyojin Season 2, Eren Yeager and others of the 104th Training Corps have just begun to become full members of the Survey Corps. As they ready themselves to face the Titans once again, their preparations are interrupted by the invasion of Wall Rose—but all is not as it seems as more mysteries are unraveled. As the Survey Corps races to save the wall, they uncover more about the invading Titans and the dark secrets of their own members.

Shows that are so addicting that you just can’t seem to stop watching them. Shows that combine many pivotal elements of storytelling together to create something that is genuinely incredibly well produced. Anime that make you wholeheartedly pleased to have become a part of the anime community.
                              Attack on Titan's first season never really sat right with me. A series more interested in cinematics (orchestrals, screaming aplenty) than it did in conveying a message or allowing its audience to care for the characters beyond whatever grisly death they inevitably succumb to. It was loud, its presence ever more so, and so I distanced myself from what seemed standard action movie cuisine.
                              Attack on titan needs no further introductions, we all know about it… there are some people who put it on a pedestal, and there are some people who denigrate it. I choose to be honest and interpret the facts as fairly as I possibly can, and not write a verbose review.
                              Season 2 has come and gone and this three month was really enjoyable, but do not fear, season 3 is already announced for 2018! Now on to the review.
                              Another fantastic anime finished and now we wait for the next season which was confirmed will be in 2018. Yet again, I'm writing this review as an au courant with the manga. I'll try my best to not include spoilers. Hahaha. Anyhoo, here I go. Please bear with me. 
                              Anticipation.
                              Do you not know? Have you not heard? The LORD is the everlasting God, the creator of the ends of the Earth. He will not grow tired or weary, and his understanding no one can fathom. He gives strength to the weary and increases the power of the weak. Even youths grow tired and weary, and young men stumble and fall; but those who hope in the LORD will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint.
                              TL;DR: Does it really matter what I write? You have waited 4 years, endured 2 trashy live action movies and restrained yourself from reading the manga to find out what's in Erin's basement. So go watch the anime to find that answer! But knowing you, you will stick around and read this review. So in short, Game of Thrones meets Inception/Memento and has a forbidden love-child they didn't reveal to the world because they were scared it will not live up to hype and success of their first child. 
                              The sequel to Attack on Titan or Shingeki no Kyoujin was probably the most awaited anime series of the decade. I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say that because the first season just made a stupendous impact on the anime industry. Fans waited, and waited, and waited, for a second season to come and after four long years(God knows what the studio was doing for this long), we finally got a second season to one of our favorite, or for some people, one of their most hated anime. 
                              Updated version of my previous top review:
                              Attack on Titan has an unfortunate truth surrounding it. Critics and fanboys surmise their opinions, incessantly hurling them at each other in hopes of smothering people into submission. One thing not present enough with this anime is a middle ground. In Season 2 we saw a surprising 12 episodes, a missing producer and a far different plot direction. The question is, did these things work for or against the franchise, and is it still the same old AoT that millions of viewers addictively engulfed several years ago? I feel it’s time to address the elephant in the room and provide a brutally honest review of          
                              TLDR Second Season wasn’t as good as the first. It was slow paced, didn’t have nearly as much action, and focused mainly on character development. The opening song goes back to the show’s origins by having a opening track that sound incredibly similar to the first theme. Probably one of this season’s biggest drawbacks is that all of season two basically happened in a single romeo-juliet-styled week (all of Romeo and Juliet took place in about one week). Because of the slowness, it wasn’t nearly as exciting as season one which showcased the mysterious nature of walls getting kicked down by abnormal titans and other          
                              Holy SHIT the flashbacks.
                              [5.0/10]
                              By seeing the rating I’ve gave this show with such praise beyond the anime community, I’m sure many must think I’m just another “mainstream anime hater”. I assure you that I have a good reason for giving this show the rating of 3."

"Pokémon-themed music video for the song ""Acacia"" by BUMP OF CHICKEN.",8.44,8,132,4218,14655,154,"                              This music video is a perfect illustration of why I love anime. 
                              I watched it about eleven times since it released. Every time i cried from nostalgia. Greatly captures feelings of bond created with characters across the entire franchise. Animation and music are both bangers. Studio responsible for the animation have shown, that they care for the franchise and love it as much as the viewers the video was targeted to. Incredible atention to details, that make you immersed in the experience. It is the embodiment of my childhood dreams and memories and I feel really thankfull that TPC wanted to acknowledge how we as Pokemon Trainers felt during those great moments in our life. Thank You          
                              Before going to my short review of this sensational music video, I would like to talk a little about Pokémon and my love for it.
                              It would seem that to properly enjoy Gotcha!, some degree of nostalgic feeling towards Pokemon is required. Which, to be fair, is not exactly unexpected. 
                              Dull, pointless and emotionless. Meaningless nostalgia bait at it's finest.
                              The Pokémon franchise is what many would call an outlier. Its success can only be described as historic, and one of the very few franchises that bridges the generational gap. Pokémon has continued to capture the hearts of young and old alike through creativity and fun. As it nears its 25th Anniversary (also Pikachu's Pokedex number), Game Freak and Nintendo surely have some exciting things up their sleeves.
                              ""We're still a long way from where we want to go, but I could stay here the rest of my life""
                              TLDR; If you grew up playing Pokémon, whether that be you’re a former trainer or a current fan, you’ll love this music video. It’s nothing short of an epic rush of nostalgia.
                              I loved this short music video, the colours and sounds show what can happen when two giants of their industries get together and work on the same project. I liked how in the first half the pokemon that were covered by blocks of colour, were covered in their primary/main colours. I just wish we got to see more of Wally than just his back shot. It was really cool seeing pokemon show love to all generations from gen 1 all the way up to their current generation, with no one generation being given priority over another. Just a heads up to anyone that has photo-sensitivities          
                              This made me really happy and really sad. 
                              This vid came out of nowhere, and it instantly became one of my favorite things ever. The animations is incredible, there are so much frames and every single one with astonishing drawings and effects. Expressions, colors, overall direction and music tell complete stories with so little time. 
                              Okay! So, I grew up watching, playing and loving Pokemon. My earliest memories involve Pokemon!
                              Pokemon has long been a part of my childhood. It inspired me in so many ways and created so many unforgettable memories. That being said, Gotcha! was one of those works that I just don't get. Sure, some of its aspects were absolutely breathtaking, but on the other hand, so much of the actual music video was just a disappointment. Maybe I put too many expectations when I watched this, but at the end of the day, although I enjoyed it, I can't say that this rekindled my nostalgia for pokemon in any way.
                              I watch this video for breakfast. This is the best thing I've ever seen. 10/10 will watch as many times as possible. Makes my heart do the happy. Big respect for anyone and everyone who worked on this masterpiece.
                              I usually don't even add music videos to my list, let alone score them. This one pulled a 10 right out of my soul tho. "
"In February 1999, a string of murders has Shiki Ryougi and Mikiya Kokutou on edge. These crimes share a disturbing resemblance to a similar set of homicides from 1995, when Shiki and Mikiya first met, and awaken a dark, murderous desire that has laid dormant within Shiki's soul ever since then.

With Shiki under suspicion due to her involvement in the past killings and supposed resemblance to the killer, she and Mikiya set out to find the true perpetrator. In the midst of their separate investigations, Mikiya grows increasingly concerned with Shiki's well-being and hurries to find the one responsible in order to protect Shiki from her own impulses. With the lead he receives from his cousin, police investigator Daisuke Akimi, Mikiya is led into the underbelly of Mifune City, as the salvation of Shiki's soul lies in his determination to prove her innocence once and for all.

But it takes a truly remarkable series to become memorable among the bottomless sea of anime. Kara no Kyoukai is that series.
                              I usually don't feel compelled to review animes.  I watched the entire ""Garden of sinners"" series of films and would give all of them a collective grade of 8 if I was forced to.  But after watching the seventh film, seeing nothing but rave reviews all over the web saying this is the best of the bunch, I felt I had to say something. 
                              This is the final and possibly best installment of the series Kara no Kyoukai: The Garden of Sinners. I would like to mention before I begin that if you have a minimal knowledge of the previous movies in the series this may spoil the franchise for you. Let me also say, I have not read the novels, for in a way, I wanted to savor the animation and suspense these movies bring. And boy am I glad I did. When I finished this anime, I was taken back for a moment. It's one of those few anime miracles that occur, a deep breath, an awkward

In addition, this is a review of the entire KnK series not just the 7th one. Any recommendations from fellow Kara no Kyoukai fans would also be appreciated. There might be spoilers so WATCH OUT. THANK YOU!!!)

                              This review is unnecessary. Whether or not you'll watch this depends on what you thought of the previous movies, not on these reviews. Yet, I feel like reviewing it anyway.
                              Well... this is the first time I've deviated so much from the consensus. I really wanted to like this movie, but unfortunately I just wasn't able to be entertained. I watched all seven movies on Amazon Prime video,and I liked every single entry except this one.

                              Satsujin Kousatsu (Part 2) is the final film in the Kara no Kyoukai series and I have somewhat mixed feelings on it. I'm not really going to touch on the artwork, animation, or the sound. Beautiful stuff as usual.
                              I have no idea what this show is doing anymore, it's become too hard to analyse. This movie/episode was both good and bad, parts of it were kinda fun, but there were countless bad parts mentioned below. Overall, it was fun riffing on it while watching. All good points and bad points mentioned before remain.
                              [Story: 9.0] On the whole, whether Kara no Kyoukai's storyline can be considered deep or sophisticated is debatable. However, it being a story with various intriguing concepts is undeniable. First and foremost, this is a very dialogue heavy show – minimal action, plenty of talking. In addition, the show also starts rather slowly; it takes quite a while for the scenes to set up. Thus it is not surprising that some may find it insipid. Hence, unlike other Fantasy/Magic series, Kara no Kyoukai is not about Magic in the manner of casting spells and fighting, it is more concerned with the inner workings. Nasu seems          
                              The 7th film in the Garden of sinners series doesn't disappoint. 
                              This is part 7 and the final part(not exactly) of the KnK series
                              WOW. Great way to completely ruin a multi film franchise. The other 6 movies were great but this was boring from start to finish and the ""heroes's message"" is really really childish and does not ring at all with rest of the series. Bravo
                              When I reviewed the first Kara no Kyoukai film, I thought that would be the end of it. I had no intention of continuing through the other six, but I changed my mind because the fan base was surprisingly cool and reasonable. I'm glad I did because the next five films ranged from decent to really superb. This week let's look at the seventh film in the series, Kara no Kyoukai 7: Satsujin Kousatsu (Kou). "

Due to this, he faces an enormous amount of pressure, both from the shogi community and his adoptive family. Seeking independence from his tense home life, he moves into an apartment in Tokyo. As a 17-year-old living on his own, Rei tends to take poor care of himself, and his reclusive personality ostracizes him from his peers in school and at the shogi hall.

However, not long after his arrival in Tokyo, Rei meets Akari, Hinata, and Momo Kawamoto, a trio of sisters living with their grandfather who owns a traditional wagashi shop. Akari, the oldest of the three girls, is determined to combat Rei's loneliness and poorly sustained lifestyle with motherly hospitality. The Kawamoto sisters, coping with past tragedies, also share with Rei a unique familial bond that he has lacked for most of his life. As he struggles to maintain himself physically and mentally through his shogi career, Rei must learn how to interact with others and understand his own complex emotions.

                              3-Gatsu was originally an anime I started watching because I love Shaft's other animes, but a few episodes in I started watching to follow along on Rei's journey. 
                              The way 3-gatsu no Lion (March comes like a lion) is written is like a poetic adventure. Only thing is, the main protagonist is in his own story and we (the audience) gets to see what they experience. From that experience, the main protagonist Rei tackles through obstacles in his life, building relationships, and growing as a person. Adapted by the manga of the same name, this is a show that really takes slice of life to a unique perspective.
                              Sangatsu no Lion is a completely pointless series, revolving around a few more than flat characters.
                              I'm going straight to the point. I've never seen a more pointless show than '3-gatsu no Lion'.
                              This review will cover both seasons of March Comes in Like a Lion.

                              Story 5/10 
                              Dear MAL members, do not be fooled like I did by the high score that this series obtained.
                              It's difficult to review slice-of-life shows through a critical lens. It's the one genre that is seemingly immune to poor reviews, simply because as long as the show is comforting, then it'll get a good score. I particularly like it when slice-of-life intersects with progress. Last year's Comic Girls did that, as well as Barakamon a few years back.
                              “The further you go, the steeper it becomes, and there won’t be anyone around you.” – Rei Kiriyama
                              Sangatsu no Lion is filled with important life lessons that is taught to us in style. It has great music, quality animation and a fantastic art style. All of this added with the writing makes for an experience to say the least.  I want to also mention that the first episode of this show made my heart ache pretty hard and it didn’t take long to understand why.  I felt like I understood Rei’s character quickly because I was Rei at one point. I did everything not because I enjoyed it but because it was necessary, I was unsure of what I really          
                              This review is for people who don't like Slice Of Life anime and find them boring and unbearable to watch but want to venture into the world of Slice Of Life anime.....This is NOT the anime to start!!
                              I'm Brazillian, so I'm not very welcomed with writing in another language, I ask you to be patient with my grammar and my English :). To summarize, Sangatsu no Lion is a seinen, very similar to a slice of life so if you don't have quite alike from this genre than it's better to think twice before watching it. The story maybe not be the best one, but it's great and delivers us the best of its premise. The art (as you may see) it's outstanding, we find beauty in her simplicity. The moments of tension are well animated, for example, when the characters are

I dove into this second season with high expectations from the first, and *most* of those expectations were satisfied. We follow Chihaya and everyone else into another year of karuta, drama, and romance. This season explored new themes and served as a lovely follow up to the first.

Chihayafuru excels by making this game of stratagem into something too human to ignore. It has no regard for how silly or strange a passion for the game may be, because the only thing it's          
                              Combining my views on both seasons-
                              (This has been slightly adapted from my reddit thread)
                              ちはやふる 2 - Chihayafuru 2 is a charming sequel to the popular first season. A truly captivating show and a very successful mix of the sport genre, with exciting competitions and the subtle sophistication of the Shoujo genre through friendship bonds. If you enjoyed the first season, this gentle, yet passionate continuation of sport and drama is sure to appeal to you too.
                              Some increased schizophrenic pacing and frustrating storytelling lead to an experience that is slightly less satisfying than the first season. Another one of those seasons where an additional third could completely redeem and change my opinion of the second. The suspense in this season was almost unbearable but awesome at the same time. A few story elements that were main arcs in the first seemed to get blown over in this season which was a bit disappointing. With all of that said this anime is still very good and really delivers on the action and suspense front. I also found myself really getting into the          
                              Wow, just wow - what a series. In this review I'll be covering both season 1 and 2, since I cannot imagine anyone who has finished season 1 would not immediately rush out and watch season 2. Spoiler free review and thoughts to follow.
                              Chihayafuru season 1 and 2 are a rather strange phenomena for me. When I read the show description back in my pubescent days I was disgusted. What a silly sounding show I thought. I'd seen the good reviews and knew people liked it, but it celebrated such a bizarre piece of Japanese culture that I found my British mind struggling to grasp at the idea of a competitive game involving poems being enjoyable. But colour me as pink as Taichi's hair I was an immediate convert! This show is a shoujo claymore, cleaving you with it's girly aesthetic till you are but paste on the          
                              ***Before talking about Chihayafuru, I have a few words to say about Studio Madhouse*****
                              I don't usually write reviews on MAL ever, but this show just... It just needs it. If you're about to watch this show, you've already seen the first season so I'll just skip on the contents and go straight to what makes Chihayafuru 2 amazing.
                              If you have not checked out season 1 watch that first because this 2nd season literally takes place right after season one with the same great stuff along with new things. Bit of a shorter review than im accustomed to but here ya go hope ya like it and agree if ya scene it."
"Kou Kitamura and Aoba Tsukishima are often at odds—even though their families happen to be close friends and business partners. Although the only child of a sports shop owner, Kou has never been interested in playing baseball. Despite this, he possesses an impressive batting ability honed by frequent visits to the local baseball batting center run by the Tsukushima family. On the other hand, Aoba loves to play baseball and is a star player with exceptional pitching form.

However, these two seemingly complete opposites share something very important to them—Wakaba Tsukishima, Aoba's older sister and Kou's destined sweetheart. Admired by the quarrelsome duo, Wakaba often finds herself the catalyst to their never-ending rivalry. But whether or not they realize that they have more in common than either would care to admit, only time will tell. The game of baseball may just be what the pair needs to ultimately overcome their own personal struggles.

                              “Simple is best.”
                              Cross Game is a very special show. Unlike most shows today, Cross Game is treats both its characters and the audience with respect. On paper, it looks to be yet another baseball series, but it shines as a rare gem of the genre.
                              Well, I will say first of all that both this manga and anime are perfectly nice, perfectly pleasant, and probably perfectly enjoyable for a lot of people. It is all smiles (except for Aoba who is, you know, completely incapable of anything but frowning or looks of indignation), all optimism, and simple but sweet. Unfortunately, that keeps it from being very good either.
                              When I think of Cross Game, I can't help but smile. It is without a doubt my current favorite slice of life anime. Those turned off by sports series need to look past that when picking up Cross Game. While baseball is a huge part of the series, the relationships between the characters is the biggest part of what makes it amazing. Baseball is simply apart of their lives. Those who enjoy character heavy slice of life anime will feel right at home with Cross Game.
                              Many people perceive the combination of genres ""School"" ""Romance"" and ""Drama"" as usual ""stamps"" in the anime industry, and this is understandable, since often such shows are filled with a lot of banal events. Having started watching Cross Game, a skeptical viewer, most likely, will be pleasantly surprised. It is pleasant to realize that already the genre in which, it would seem, it is impossible to find anything new, there are some exceptions that not only make it interesting to watch what is happening, but also in certain events can surprise.
                              Sometimes, simplicity is a beautiful thing. At the heart of ""Cross Game"" is a simple shounen story about baseball and romance. But even though it's the kind of story where you can roughly predict the ending within the first few episodes, there's never a dull moment. Heart warming, heart wrenching, beautiful in its simplicity... the joy of watching ""Cross Game"" comes not from its destination, but from the journey itself.
                              An anime that is perfect in so many ways that it has inspired me to write a review through its sheer perfection.
                              I am typically hesitant to even begin decently long shonen series. They tend to be filled with flaws that reflect lazy writing for the sake of length, unfortunately. From huge casts of characters, ranging from the barely touched upon yet interesting side characters to the incredibly dull main characters who receive much more than their fair share of exposure. On top of that, there are occasionally long stretches of boring developments or slow pacing to keep the content running. Very often these lengthy series become too stagnant and similar to itself, leading me to feeling the need to take breaks from the show simply because          
                              *Note: This review does not contain spoilers, but indirectly alludes to events that take place during the first episode*
                              Writing a review over a sports anime is something I myself never expected to do but Cross Game is in a different league and deserved one. Sports anime generally stick with the basic formula of 1 person having amazing talent and taking a team by his/her hand and making it the best team there is, now if you read the synopsis you will have the same impression as you have with any sports anime however Cross Game(CG from here on) is not your usual sports anime.
                              My first impression of this show was ""another sport-themed anime? ¬¬"". yeah i was expecting something like prince of tennis or captain tsubasa with baseball (you know, naturally impossible balls and over reacting of the game). it comes out that i was wrong.

                              Let's keep this review short, I don't like long reviews, I'm a busy guy with not a lot of free time. Even still, I find it hard to not write a bit about this anime Cross Game, even after two weeks of watching it.

"At the renowned Shuchiin Academy, Miyuki Shirogane and Kaguya Shinomiya are the student body's top representatives. Ranked the top student in the nation and respected by peers and mentors alike, Miyuki serves as the student council president. Alongside him, the vice president Kaguya—eldest daughter of the wealthy Shinomiya family—excels in every field imaginable. They are the envy of the entire student body, regarded as the perfect couple.

However, despite both having already developed feelings for the other, neither are willing to admit them. The first to confess loses, will be looked down upon, and will be considered the lesser. With their honor and pride at stake, Miyuki and Kaguya are both equally determined to be the one to emerge victorious on the battlefield of love!

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.43,8,138,82,934673,22527,"                              Confessing love to someone is one of the most intimidating challenges we face in our lives. 
                              To describe Kaguya-sama: Love is War as a battlefield of love, between two prideful geniuses, who see confessing as a sign of “weakness” is well—sort of misleading.
                              Almost every time someone talks to me about a romantic comedy, they'd would mention how well the romance is delivered. Then along came this show called Kaguya-sama: Love is War that goes beyond than just being a romantic comedy. In a landscape dominated by recent isekai shows, there’s a need for fresh air. Kaguya-sama managed be just that. 
                              This is one of those special anime that perfectly represents why I’ve been sticking with anime for so long. Love is War exudes brilliance with every fiber of its being. It has so much going for it, and offers something that practically everyone can enjoy. In simpler terms, it’s just so damn good bruh! What, don’t believe me? pfft, how cute. Let me lecture you on why this anime is pure excellence. 
                              “See, this show's what having a good director can do for your fuckin' show. You can make A-1 Pictures look like a competent studio. That's fucked up!” -DEEsidia from REVEL HOUSE, 2019 
                              A random day back in December 2015 had me giving a chance to at that point very recent manga called Kaguya-sama after the cover grabbed my attention, not too many chapters after I already fell in love with it and it eventually became my favorite work ever and the one that I was waiting like crazy for an adaptation to happen, and when that time came… oh god, they couldn't have delivered harder!

                              ""If I cover my ears, then my hands aren't free to protect my belly button!""
                              I’ve seen plenty of romantic comedy anime series that draw interest with their own sort of game, but never before have I seen such a series like this one strut their stuff and dance it out like this one.

                              In Spring season, i was looking forward to two anime in particular Promised neverland and kaguya sama love is war.
                              When I saw the episode one for 5 mins I stopped watching and closed the site. It was so kind of frustrating to listen to the narrators voice it almost made my ears bleed. 
                              Little to nothing is good about this show.
                              I’ll keep this review simple Love is war isn’t terrible because it’s popular, it’s terrible because nothing happens in the show. I want you to imagine two of your friends wanting to date each other however they both are too proud to admit it to one another. Stretch that for 12 episodes and what you get is a show that will make you sit down for 20 good min of literally nothing. Every episode is like a lead up to progressing the relationship only to go back square 1 with slight variations between each other. For example in one episode they say some endearing things          "
"The Tokise High School Koto Club has courageously pushed through their fractured and unsynchronized performance at the Kanto Region Traditional Japanese Music Festival. Clubmembers Chika Kudou, Satowa Houzuki, Takezou Kurata, Hiro Kurusu, Kouta Mizuhara, Saneyasu Adachi, and Michitaka Sakai are devastated to learn the negative results of their performance, leaving them crushed. Nonetheless, the group recognizes their potential and enthusiastically agree to collectively sharpen their skills, improve their flaws, and develop higher caliber playing to succeed in the upcoming national qualifiers in winter. 

With the help of their now willing club advisor Suzuka Takinami, the group's goal gradually becomes achievable as they begin to grasp the foundations of good music and refine their koto-playing abilities, with the suggestion of performing more often to gain what they lack most—experience. 

However, as their journey to nationals is underway, the koto club members face challenges that obstruct their focus and progress. Not only does the threat of other powerhouse schools and musicians remain, but the high school issues of budding romance and soon-to-be-graduating seniors also begin to push the limits of the determined group of teenagers and the future of the koto club.

With the introduction of Kono Oto Tomare's 1st cour in Spring to set up for the lesser of things, then in Summer, Given's Shoujo-ai outclassed adaptation of a masterpiece, and then back towards this series' 2nd cour to finish up the race that has been built up from the 1st half. And I'd have to say that the experience is totally worth it from start to finish, I can still readily and heartily give this a 10/10 just like          
                              Music is a strange thing. Sometimes, its melody carries a bit of fun and sweetness, making everyone listening immerse in the happiness. Sometimes, it is tinged with a bit of sadness, a pain and hidden feelings bursting out to be heard. But as the melodies intertwine, they bring forth a mixed feeling. As if, the sky is crying.
                              As this anime that has given us a breath of fresh air for this last season of 2019, I just can't help but be amaze that something like this was aired, so kudos for Platinum Vision and Original Creator, Amyuu Sakura for coming up with something like this, so here are my ratings for this ""Very Good"" anime:
                              I completed this series on 4/2/2020 6:29pm
                              Highly recommended! Go for it! 
                              When I found this anime, I thought. Will traditional anime music be as good as some drama music anime such as ""Hibike euphonium"" or ""Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso"" which is very popular, especially seeing studios where there are not many projects like this, but I was wrong.
                              I did a review on the first season. I did it for both seasons so might as well copy paste:
                              The anime is a wonderful piece of storytelling, which really touch me personally. The story means a lot to me in some way, because it relates to me during my early phase of childhood. That being said, without any spoiler, I do really hope that someday, when I grow older, I will be able to have the opportunity to watch another season of the anime. It really touches me, the storytelling is amazing and it may be biased of me to say this but because it tells a story which I personally can relate to at the beginning of my music learning experience.           
                              This review is based on my opinion so don't take it seriously and fyi english isn't my native language. Here is my review from season 2
                              As for me, it must be said that it's almost the best anime I've seen last year.
                              How is it that an anime this peaceful can exist? Someone tell me, because I always click away from each episode feeling happy. 
                              This anime was the most emotional one that I have ever seen!
                              This is just my personal opinion and review of the anime/series.
                              I cannot help myself giving this anime a 10 out of 10 overall. I know that it is a bit bias but hear me out on this one.

"Continuing his masquerade as the deranged lunatic from the Lanling Jin Clan, Wei Wuxian resides in the Cloud Recesses while his former cultivation classmate, Lan Wangji, searches for answers about the demonic severed arm they have in custody. With an overwhelming dark energy emanating from the arm, the two are forced to work together in order to keep it contained. However, the demonic arm is not the only dark force lurking in the region, and as spiritual tensions rise in the mountains of the Gusu Lan Clan, it is up to the two of them to try and restore the natural order.

The story of Wei Wuxian's fall from grace continues as more light is shed on his descent into the path of demonic cultivation. The demonic arm only further strains his mischievous spirit. This is the time for him to prove that he has truly broken free from the forbidden path and is not the maniacal sorcerer that everyone remembers him to be.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.43,8,140,2148,54507,866,"                              I’m not very good at expressing my opinions in writing but I felt that I needed to try for this show. I absolutely adore the novel and the 1st season of the donghua (Chinese anime) and I have been obsessed with it since I found the show last October. While this 2nd season is still beautifully animated the characters are still wonderful, the story is sorely lacking and I feel really bad for “anime only” watchers. I don’t know how they followed along with the story as its messy. It’s just difficult to follow the story if you don’t have knowledge from the novel to          
                              Mo Dao Zu Shi S1 did exceptionally well. Therefore, S2 was no exception. Like always, the animation is very good, the story is intriguing as always, and the characters never cease to amaze me, both in a good and bad way.
                              Thoroughly enjoyed the second season.
                              Season 2 doesn't disappoint.This season is just as great as the first one.
                              Capitalism lives on and I paid a membership to finish this season (8eps in total) early, here comes the review you're looking for that is not a 10.
                              Honestly, as a Chinese person, I've never found much draw in period Chinese dramas/animations. I just tend to find the idea of ancient China and notions like sworn brotherhoods over-romanticized... but Mo Dao Zu Shi drew me in easily. The music is fantastic. I don't think I've ever come across any show that made music instruments seem so cool and believable as ""weapons"". The consistent emphasis on the idea of ""cultivation"" grounds the possibility that sounds created by instruments can have that power. This ""cultivation"" affects one's personality, status in society, sense of identity etc. And instruments having powers isn't treated as a whim in          
                              (As of writing this, I have seen 6 episodes of MDZS 2. Will update when all episodes are translated.)
                              It's all about the anime ok?
                              In my opinion, the second season of Mo Dao Zu Shi got to be as good as the first, unfortunately it was much short. What bothered me about the first one is that she left many things open, events were very fast (aside from the timeline being a bit confusing). But the second explained them with great mastery. And honestly, it was a very exciting arc! Not only did Wei Xuxian have a tragic end in his other life, but also other characters that I loved very much."
"The ""Medicine Seller"" is a deadly and mysterious master of the occult who travels across feudal Japan in search of malevolent spirits called ""mononoke"" to slay. When he locates one of these spirits, he cannot simply kill it; he must first learn its Form, its Truth, and its Reason in order to wield the mighty Exorcism Sword and fight against it. He must begin  his strange exorcisms with intense psychological analysis and careful investigative work—an extremely dangerous step, as he must first confront and learn about the mononoke before he even has the means to defeat it.

The Medicine Seller's journey leads him to an old-fashioned inn where Shino, a pregnant woman, has finally found a place to rest. The owner has reluctantly placed her in the last vacant room; however, as she settles in, it quickly becomes clear that the room is infested by a lethal band of mononoke, the Zashiki Warashi. With his hunter's intuition, the Medicine Seller begins his investigation to discover the Form, the Truth, and the Reason before the Zashiki Warashi can kill again.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.43,8,141,685,217619,5750,"                              My initial impression of Mononoke was literally, &quot;...&quot;. After giving it a chance I am glad that I wasn't quick to judge and saw it through. Mononoke is a collection of short stories revolving around mysterious spirits/creatures known as, from the title, Mononoke. The writing and directing of the series are excellently done and really immerse you in the story itself. Each arc is a new story with new characters that are well fleshed out in the beginning of each segment. The Medicine Seller, Kusuriuri, is the only recurring character and is mysterious as always with each new arc.
                              When someone talks about the genre of horror, immediately a few things come to mind: blood, violent motion, bone and flesh torn asunder, gore essentially approaching abundant forms of shock value. These are what characterize the images that litter the horror genre today. However, one cannot discount the impact of simpler techniques. Muffled voices, the bloodcurdling scream, the manic dip toward insanity; these are all subtler methods which give rise to the imagination and thus leave a more impressionable impact. Mononoke adopts such techniques in each of its standalone stories, and it may not be surprising that these implementations are often left unappreciated. Yet, by          
                              Mononoke is generally thought of as one of the most artistic shows in the medium, if not the most artistic one out there, and it is hailed as a more artistic version of the famous Anime Mushishi, filled with bright yellow and orange colors in contrast to Mushishi’s dim grey and white foggy ones, and animation that comes off as surreal for most of the time. The problem here is that this Anime, although artistically achieved what it wanted to achieve in the long run, became one of the most nauseating experiences I have ever had with an Anime, if not the most nauseating experience          
                              This is like Die Hard, but with angry spirits, a medicine seller, in Edo-period Japan.
                              The wooden curtain opens with a sinister smile revealing the first scene:
                              Deadly monsters, haunting spirits, and supernatural entities that are beyond human to even describe with words are but a few examples of what makes horror an appealing genre to many. There are great examples of works of horror that can be considered real masterpieces in its kind. However, it is undoubtedly one of the most accessible genres to not succeed in garnering pure terror within its framework. Especially with anime, where there are only a handful of noteworthy horror shows and the rest only come up with predictable scares and horror tropes being used way too much. Mononoke fits, unfortunately, to the latter; but only          
                              Mononoke is a collection of horror fairy tales, a thrilling blend of mystery, murder and the supernatural. The main and the only recurring character is the Medicine Seller, a laconic man of whom we learn almost nothing, and who, throughout the series, only using his knowledge and a handful of tools, battles the various Mononoke. 
                              Emotions, it's a powerful thing that lurks in human. It can manipulate your feelings, actions, and thoughts. Love, Hate, and other emotions can easily enter your inner-self, creating something we called Demons. Mononoke portrayed how atrocious human emotion can be, and how great an episodic anime can tell a story. 
                              You can't say you've seen 'em all until you've seen MONONOKE.
                              “My friends, let me ask you of your Truth and Regret. So long as Mononoke roam this world...” - Kusuriuri (The Medicine Seller), Episode 12
                              Mononoke appears as the continuation of the adventures of a certain character of the last arc of the series Ayakashi. To complement our viewing pleasure, some more arks were added, using an original art style and ingenious storytelling with the sole and honest objective of telling us about stories that could be our own.
                              Have you ever got to the point in watching modern anime where you're lacking that refreshing series? Do you sometimes feel the medium has become watered down and need something to reevaluate your interest in anime? To those of you who feel this way, your Lord and Savior has arrived. Enter Mononoke stage right. A bizarre 2007 release by animation giant Toei Studios (One Piece, Dragonball, Air Gear), Mononoke is unconventional, haunting, suspenseful and dramatic. Coupled with the most striking and unique art style I've come across in ages, Mononoke seeks to create a theatrical masterpiece through its uncanny vignettes. The verdict? Well, you’ll just          
                              First of all: this anime is a masterpiece, and I do REALLY mean it.
                              I'll try too keep this review rather short and concise, but I'll probably just start rambling and won't be able to stop myself if I get out of hand. Since I'm such a rambler, please forgive me if it sometimes seems somewhat unorganized even though I'll do some organizing when it's done. If you're not bothered to read the whole things I wrote 3 pros and 3 cons at the bottom.
                              Lately I have found that I like shows that have an overall goal for the plot and character development in stead of the episodic, story-arc-of-the-week, formula, but Mononoke is an example of the episodic formula done right while also going all-out, resulting in a very unique show."
"Daikichi Kawachi is a 30-year-old bachelor working a respectable job but otherwise wandering aimlessly through life. When his grandfather suddenly passes away, he returns to the family home to pay his respects. Upon arriving at the house, he meets a mysterious young girl named Rin who, to Daikichi’s astonishment, is his grandfather's illegitimate daughter!

The shy and unapproachable girl is deemed an embarrassment to the family, and finds herself ostracized by her father's relatives, all of them refusing to take care of her in the wake of his death. Daikichi, angered by their coldness towards Rin, announces that he will take her in—despite the fact that he is a young, single man with no prior childcare experience.

Usagi Drop is the story of Daikichi's journey through fatherhood as he raises Rin with his gentle and affectionate nature, as well as an exploration of the warmth and interdependence that are at the heart of a happy, close-knit family.

                              Secretly funded by the Japanese government to combat declining birth rates, project ""USAGI DROP"" targeted a very specific, generally non-reproductive demographic of the Japanese population: the otaku. At the core of the project was a 11 episode television series that was specifically designed to thoroughly rouse hibernating paternal instincts. Researchers noted a 41% increase in the desire to have children in males in their 20s to 30s who watched a single episode of Usagi Drop. Researchers also noted that of that 41%, 77% of those males explicitly stated that they wanted daughters. One of the biggest advantages project USAGI DROP had over its predecessor, project          
                              To be Frank, I was skeptical about committing to watching Usagi Drop having read all the manga. Adaptations are great and all, but boy oh boy the direction source material (manga) took betrayed my expectations, leaving me doubtful about this as a whole.
                              God. I suppose this was best time in my life for me to watch this series. I just went through a lot of stress with family and this really helped me understand some of the things that go on when you're a parent, even a single parent. I'm not gonna say the cliche stuff like ""It's never easy being a parent."" and I can't say anything from experience, as I am not a father or legal guardian. But I was raised by a single mother without a father in my life until 7 years ago.
                              Story:
                              UD is a parenting manual. It is an anime that deals with the issues of raising a kid and how you must pretty much sacrifice everything for it. There are no boobs or giant robots here; this is so much slice of life it is practically bleeding. 
                              Usagi Drop started out as a manga by Unita Yumi. The anime adaptation was handled by Production I.G. It's also the second Josei series I've been asked to review. The other being Nodame Cantabile. Let's take a look at Usagi Drop and see how it compares.
                              Usagi Drop is a breath of fresh air for those who are a bit tired with the excessive amounts of fanservice, dull characters, and even duller plots that seem to plague the medium. For once we can have an anime that touches upon issues in a serious and honest manner, while having just about the right amount of lightheartedness and humor that prevents the series from getting too heavy. The result is a heartwarming, feel good tale that manages to allow viewers to empathize with the characters and perhaps the show as a whole to be adorable without feeling that they are being insulted.
                              Slice of life is generally a tricky genre to get right. When I say slice of life, I don't mean those dime-a-dozen high school comedies the industry has become oversaturated with as of late. Rather, I refer to series that find something meaningful to explore through the small conflicts of commonplace events. All too often, attempts at this genre come off as either excessive and unnatural or dull and listless. It stands to reason, then, that the best shows of this kind are the ones that introduce unfamiliar elements that make these characters' lives distinct from our own, while still staying in touch with the          
                              Children are no easy task to take care of. They require a lot of attention and patience to deal with. As a child, I was reckless and very stubborn. I'm glad my parents dealt with me and loved me for who I am. Though when a family member dies, a person can change in a way to make them more secluded and feeling alone, but when someone reaches out to you with love and care, they can change back.
                              Script - A guy takes care of a girl. Implications? She gets happier than before. Guy becomes more responsible. New connections are established on a superficial level and by the end what you have is a guide on how to raise children that actually doesn't work. Why? Because the child in question isn't a child, but an adult. A smaller version of it at least. She's so mature it is not even fun to see the protagonist parenting, we know it is not necessary. The only reason why the initial relationship between the two takes place is that she's traumatized due her father's death. That

                              Beautiful...a word often used in the realms of the arts, except of course in anime. Anime is often comical, action packed, suspenseful, mysterious, heart-warming...but it is rare when one can truly describe an anime as being beautiful.

                              As a kid, I often searched for inspirations through celebrity pop stars, acclaimed sportsmen, and even fictional characters wearing underpants outside of their trousers. Whilst all that time, the tall figure holding my right hand was, and still is, the biggest hero of my life."
"Jinta Yadomi is peacefully living as a recluse, spending his days away from school and playing video games at home instead. One hot summer day, his childhood friend, Meiko ""Menma"" Honma, appears and pesters him to grant a forgotten wish. He pays her no mind, which annoys her, but he doesn't really care. After all, Menma already died years ago.

At first, Jinta thinks that he is merely hallucinating due to the summer heat, but he is later on convinced that what he sees truly is the ghost of Menma. Jinta and his group of childhood friends grew apart after her untimely death, but they are drawn together once more as they try to lay Menma's spirit to rest. Re-living their pain and guilt, will they be able to find the strength to help not only Menma move on—but themselves as well?

We always feel that death is such an alien concept, it exists but is somehow detached and unrelated to our own little world until it comes knocking on our doorstep. Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai (We Still Don't Know the Name of the Flower We Saw That Day), tries to show us just how powerful an effect death can have on us.
                              What do you do, when you suddenly see a ghost of a person that you were close to? Most people would think it's just their imagination or the effect of stress. But what if your mind doesn't play tricks on you and you really encounter a ghost from the past? AnoHana plays with this idea. The story starts out on a usual day for the shut-in Jinta, who suddenly sees the ghost of his childhood friend Menma. Menma tells Jinta she has a wish that she wants to be granted by him. And from here on, Jinta's unusual summer starts.
                              ""Oh no, here come the tears!""
                              In this review I will defend the claim that ""Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai"" is an absolutely terrible show.  It is well known that this show get's a lot of positive attention.  At the time of this write-up, it is currently ranked 42nd on the site overall (or, if the site had good programmers, 39th since Gintama 2015, Unlimited Bladeworks season 2, and One Punch Man are above it and have not even aired any episodes), with a weighted score of 8.70.  It is often discussed in forums as being a tear jerker.  Indeed, there          
                              I don't often follow currently airing shows. It's usually hard to tell which shows are genuinely good until the hype dies down a bit. But under intense peer pressure, I started following a certain series this season. That show is ""Deadman Wonderland"". To cut a long story short, it sucked. So to deal with the disappointment I decided to follow another series, the sleeper hit ""Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai"", which apparently translates roughly to ""We Still Don't Know the Name of That Flower We Were Smoking When We Came Up With This Title"". Something like that. With a

                              Death of a close friend is always difficult to deal with, mainly because it always comes when you least expect it. It is especially hard to portray it accurately in any medium, let alone anime. When I first heard of Anohana, I was expecting a beautiful story about a group of friends coming to accept the death of their beloved friend and eventually becoming better people. I was sorely mistaken. Anohana is a travesty of writing and I have no idea why this deserved any praise whatsoever.
                              I watched Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai (I will call it Anohana in this review) after all the episodes had aired so I didn't have to wait for each episode. I saw a lot of posts about this on tumblr so I decided to give it a try. 
                              Ano Hina has a charming premise and interesting first few episodes. A lot of times in the later of the series there are tear-jerking moments. However I was a little disappointed with how it played out in the end. Of course, I stuck with it until the end because there was something sweet about it.
                              I begin this review with informing you.
                              In youth, we tend to over-exaggerate, over-analyse, and over-experience any event. That ice cream we ate for the first time as a child will never quite taste that good again; even as teenagers and later adults, we chase after these childhood fantasies, never quite giving up on finding that metaphorical ""fountain of youth."" What's the most likely thing, then, to happen if one were to experience childhood trauma? Perhaps insanity in later life, a cold heart, apathy, denial, or maybe all of the above? What exactly does happen? Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai explores this phenomenon that happens when          
                              At first AnoHana didn't catch my attention at all. I thought it was a plotless anime about a group of friends who spend their summer with each other. When I ran out of ongoing anime I could look forward to during my week, I decided to try this one. I realized that I had completely underestimated this show.
                              After finishing Anohana, I could only think of one thing -
                              Why? why this garbage of a show has 8.5 score?!!
                              So this is my first review thus bear with me:)"
"During the early 1930s in Chicago, the transcontinental train, Flying Pussyfoot, is starting its legendary journey that will leave a trail of blood all over the country. At the same time in New York, the ambitious scientist Szilard and his unwilling aide Ennis are looking for missing bottles of the immortality elixir. In addition, a war between the mafia groups is getting worse. On board the Advena Avis, in 1711, alchemists are about to learn the price of immortality.

Based on the award-winning light novels of the same name, Baccano! follows several events that initially seem unrelated, both in time and place, but are part of a much bigger story—one of alchemy, survival, and immortality. Merging these events together are the kindhearted would-be thieves, Isaac and Miria, connecting various people, all of them with their own hidden ambitions and agendas, and creating lifelong bonds and consequences for everyone involved.

[Written by MAL Rewrite] ",8.42,8,144,129,717071,21887,"                              Baccano! is a series with a huge fanbase who see in it as a wonderful ensemble of colorful characters, complex web of interwoven plots and wonderfully jazzy soundtrack. 
                              Throughout my childhood, I wasn't really much into movies or the whole moving picture theater idea when I was young. I was more into video games and playing outside. All that changed when i watched a certain movie called Reservoir Dogs. At first, I was only into it simply because of the blood and violence. But further throughout my multiple viewings, I realized that the story and acting was also a big part of my fascination to this particular film. Then a few years after that another movie created by the same person came out called Pulp Fiction. This was done  in the same          
                              Baccano! has a great reputation among many American fans, who lauded its boundless energy, larger than life characters, and unconventional narrative style. As I eventually watched it, I discovered that Baccano! indeed has all that stuff and could understand why so many people love it. And yet, curiously enough it never ascended beyond a mildly entertaining show for me. 
                              Title: Baccano!
                              Baccano! Is a Shounen, Supernatural, Action, Adventure, Comedy series with a very attention-grabbing and peculiar story style that&rsquo;s entertaining to watch. There&rsquo;s plenty excitement and laughs to be had however prepare to be lost, at some point, in the numerous, connected storylines. ^_^  
                              Never before has so much madness been crammed into so short a series.
                              It bothers me to say I took a while to realize the quality of ""Baccano!"". Aside from boasting no less than 18 main characters, the Pulp Fiction-esque narrative would constantly fracture and leap back and forth in time. I didn't like that I had to make an effort to constantly focus and be forced to remember so many names and faces; three episodes in, I was feeling frustrated and close to losing interest. Something needed to be done and in a last ditch attempt to salvage the series, it became clear I'd have to wait it out, build up the fansubs and spend a long          
                              I’m sure most people are fully aware in this decade that Baccano is a tale of three stories told in different timelines that are told all at once through a combination of Guy Ritchie and Quentin Tarantino’s styles. Each story is largely self-contained, but some of the same characters are present in each story (ex. Isaac and Miria in the 1930 and 31 stories) and/or related to characters from a different story. As the first half of the introductory episode states, Baccano is a story with no beginnings, no endings, and no main character. It’s just pure undiluted chaos the entire way through, constantly jumping          
                              After finishing Baccano!...  I can't help but name it a truly mediocre and barely entertaining really obnoxious show.
                              It is said by many (Livejournal users), that everyone has a story inside them just waiting to be told. 
                              In anime, we should automatically celebrate when something like Baccano is tossed away. We should revel in what a delicious candy we are gorging down... but also realize that its still a candy.
                              Click. BANG! That's the signal! Grab your stylish hat, your most powerful gun, and employ your sixth sense (you'll need it!). What Baccano! confronts you with is exciting, fun, mildly disturbing and incredibly unique.
                              Baccano is not only a great example of what can happen when a series is based on a series of novels, but also a refreshing reminder of why I watch anime.
                              When was the last time that you were stuck in a traffic jam and looked around you, only to find all the other drivers’ expressions mirror yours exactly? The frustration, the annoyance and the exasperation plastered all across their faces, each telling a story of their own, as loud horns blare in the background. The irritated young fellow next to you might be rushing because he has a huge presentation to make in front of the office’s senior officials. The middle-aged woman in the minivan behind you might be furious because her son got into trouble at university and they were calling her over when          
                              I kept putting off Bacanno because the art really shouted out to me and, as vain a conclusion as this is, I thought the art was an insight into how good the show was going to be, and therefore put it off for when I was having a bad day and just wanted a really good show to pick me up. Ufortunately Bacanno doesn't reach that excellence for me, but it certainly isn't a bad show."
"Hunters are specialized in a wide variety of fields, ranging from treasure hunting to cooking. They have access to otherwise unavailable funds and information that allow them to pursue their dreams and interests. However, being a hunter is a special privilege, only attained by taking a deadly exam with an extremely low success rate.

Gon Freecss, a 12-year-old boy with the hope of finding his missing father, sets out on a quest to take the Hunter Exam. Along the way, he picks up three companions who also aim to take the dangerous test: the revenge-seeking Kurapika, aspiring doctor Leorio Paladiknight, and a mischievous child the same age as Gon, Killua Zoldyck.

Hunter x Hunter is a classic shounen that follows the story of four aspiring hunters as they embark on a perilous adventure, fighting for their dreams while defying the odds.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.42,8,145,321,418976,9591,"                              First off, for the sake of simplicity I'm going to cover all four series (one TV series and three OVAs) in one review, since they actually form a single continuous story. 
                              No matter the version, HxH is my favorite shounen series of all time. This adaptation is my favorite despite lacking the new story arcs (:
                              Hunter x Hunter is your typical Shounen, Action, Adventure anime with the usual plot-devices but with a pretty unique concept of &ldquo;hunting&rdquo;. This series may not adrenaline filled action sequences but it is still highly enjoyable, with plenty of tension.
                              The basic premise of the story is Gon, a young boy living on Whale Island, one day meets an apprentice of his father. This hunter tells him about his long lost father, Ging, and awakens in Gon the desire to become a hunter in order to find his father. Along the way to the Professional Hunter Exams, Gon meets and befriends Killua (from an assassin family), Kurapica (last survivor of a tribe murdered by the Ryodan) and Leorio (who wants to be a doctor).
                              Hunters… What do you think about when you hear this?  An Anime about people killing poor cute animals?  Of course this is not it, all the animals are ugly! lol
                              Overall: 
                              Note: This review will encompass the main series and the OVAs since they all flow together. There might be some minor spoilers, depending on what you consider a spoiler.
                              First, I will state watched this series at least 3 times. You may be thinking I'm quite biased, especially giving it a 10. But that's how I really feel since this Anime always manages to excite me yet give me a wide range of emotions. Mostly excite though ( I find it to be an adrenaline pumping Anime )
                              The lack of fandom surrounding Hunter X Hunter is somewhat enigmatic to me. It is a title that, by all rights, should have a huge buzz behind it. Not only is Hunter X Hunter the work of Yoshihiro Togashi, the creator of Yu Yu Hakusho, but it is also far superior to other currently running big-hype titles, the most prominent of which is Naruto. It manages to be enormously entertaining through its unique concoction of animation, characterization, and plot, without resorting to the cliches that have all too often ruined a seemingly novel show of a similar vein. And yet Hunter X Hunter remains little          
                              One of my all time favourites, I\'ve re-watched this anime 3 times and I\'m not tired of it yet. The series include a balance of humour, plot, action and character, not to mention there were no filler episodes, unlike some other action-based shounen anime.Also, unlike some other action-bases series where the storyline is pretty much predictable, Hunter x Hunter isn\'t - in fact, it contained many twists that I wouldn\'t had expected (example: re-examination of the 2nd round exam in the Hunter Exam). The anime illustrated some important lessons in life, such as friendship, determination and teamwork, through scenarios that might actually happen in real          
                              As a fan of HxH 2011 I thought to myself it would be fun to watch the first anime  adaption and compare the two of them, this review will therefore refer to the 2011 adaption from time to time. This is also why this is supposed to mostly aim for those who have already watched HxH-11. This review will be reviewing the anime series and its 3 ovas which makes it 92 episodes long instead of 62.
                              I'm not a big shonen follower. I dislike long anime. Yet Hunter x Hunter, from the creator of Yu Yu Hakusho, managed to sneak its way into my top 5 anime of all time. 
                              I'm sure you know about the series if you've found my review so I'll give my thoughts.
                              I cannot recommend this anime for anything but comparison since the 2011 anime came out. While there may be a bias on my part having seen the 2011 adaptation first, if I had seen this version first I likely would have never stuck with the series to become a part of the fandom.
                              Hunter x Hunter, I' watched the show once in a former television channel, since at first glance the series did not seem flashy, but continued talking of my friends about the series I did buy it in format disc that had Fortune had a store discs needed."
"Seishuu Handa is an up-and-coming calligrapher: young, handsome, talented, and unfortunately, a narcissist to boot. When a veteran labels his award-winning piece as ""unoriginal,"" Seishuu quickly loses his cool with severe repercussions.

As punishment, and also in order to aid him in self-reflection, Seishuu's father exiles him to the Goto Islands, far from the comfortable Tokyo lifestyle the temperamental artist is used to. Now thrown into a rural setting, Seishuu must attempt to find new inspiration and develop his own unique art style—that is, if boisterous children (headed by the frisky Naru Kotoishi), fujoshi middle schoolers, and energetic old men stop barging into his house! The newest addition to the intimate and quirky Goto community only wants to get some work done, but the islands are far from the peaceful countryside he signed up for. Thanks to his wacky neighbors who are entirely incapable of minding their own business, the arrogant calligrapher learns so much more than he ever hoped to.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.41,8,146,235,508568,10957,"                              Watching Barakamon was like going to a birthday party or a picnic outdoors, chock full of excited children running all over the place, doing what they do best. As an adult (supposedly), you feel slightly out of place but the child in you just wants to jump up and down with them in frantic jubilation without a care in the world. There is a cake too: a black forest with strawberry toppings and as you immerse yourself in the jovial mood, you admit that the feeling of sharing a slice with everyone is sweeter than the cake itself.
                              Barakamon is a work of art. However, it’s more than just calligraphy as words alone cannot describe the exact nature and discovery of Barakamon. For instance, the show takes place on an island involving a young man named Seishuu Handa. Coming from a more urban based background, his life changes forever as he finds his new life on the natural island of Goto. Of course, this doesn’t happen after he delivers a sucker punch to an elder curator. When someone throws a fit like that, it’s easy to guess that consequences are destined to follow. But can we really call a journey to Goto Island          
                              One of the hallmarks of a quality slice of life show is its ability to make you forget about the real world and immerse you in their world, if only for a few minutes. You laugh alongside the characters as they do silly things, get anxious as they struggle through trials and tribulations, and then feel relieved when those problems are resolved. Barakamon does an excellent job of accentuating this aspect of the slice of life genre. Through a cast of quirky and unique characters along with simple yet powerful storytelling, Barakamon portrays the life of a man who strives to discover his true identity          
                              When the last season of animes started, i was looking forward for just three animes: Tokyo Ghoul, Akame ga Kill and SAO2. Nothing more than that. I wasn't a big fan of slice of life anime, even though i had watched some after, i used to think that this genre was boring.
                              Without fail, this anime had me in stitches after hours and hours of watching all the episodes for 2 days. (sorry, I didn't finish it in one because of chores.)  
                              Our surroundings shape us.
                              Some 'people' may describe Slice of Life is nothing but a boring genre, the phrase for someone who dislike SOL is ""Why do we have to watch anime that tells the life we live day to day?"", but the truth is not like that. One of the main objectives of a Slice of Life genre is delivering a straight message of life itself. And Barakamon is a great example to prove that.
                              Well, my review got deleted for not following the guidelines so I uploaded it. ~
                              Without a doubt, Barakamon is one of the most relaxing anime out there in existence. If I had to describe Barakamon in short, it would be that it has been, a true panacea. 
                              This anime is definitely a refreshing and unique slice of life anime, watching it gives me nostalgia of whenever I have failed at something and had build evaluate and try again, which I’m sure everyone can relate. Watching the show and characters interact is a great joy; seeing each person going through new experiences and emotions. Barakamon is definitely a wonderful addition to the slice of life genre, that people can relate to and enjoy. 
                              Often, the slice-of-life genre is viewed as what is more or less the Seinfeld genre of anime - that they are ""shows about nothing."" This is by no means a bad thing - shows like Non Non Biyori to a stellar job of proving that a show about the most inane daily activities can be greatly entertaining and sometimes even emotional. But that is also no excuse to produce SoL shows that have no true plot or character development. And that's where Barakamon comes in.
                              ‘Barakamon’ is a rare kind of story. Something that is just so simple, yet so powerful. There are no big expositions of drama and no complicated plotlines, none of that is needed in the slightest. The story is simple, easy to grasp, and beautiful to watch as it plays out. In its purest form, it’s simply the story of an arrogant (but still kind-hearted) young man that simply can’t seem to let go of his pride, and how he matures from the time he spends with the townsfolk of his new home. 
                              This anime is one of the best I've seen in recent history. The story, though simple, is heartwarming in the truest form. The episodes are mostly day-to-day adventures, but each one is clever, uplifting, and very often hilarious.
                              Well first review, I'll go for it... What could I say: this anime may not have action or romance but it has something very few animes could claim to have: authenticity. The characters are coherent, natural and really lovable. The overall art is great and some scenes are truly astonishing. In term of personal enjoyment, it has been a while since I smiled so much during an anime: the humor of the situations is light and there're a lot of heartwarming scenes. Too short might've been the only flaw but the ending was at a perfect place to stop. It was damn near perfect, im          
                              Barakamon…  Ah, the feeling of watching something so laid-back is really refreshing. First thing that came into my mind when I heard Barakamon was, to tell you the truth, Digimon. I’m sorry, I really am! Good thing I was wrong. Phew. * wipes sweat *"
"Iori Kitahara moves to the coastal town of Izu for his freshman year at its university, taking residence above Grand Blue, his uncle's scuba diving shop. Iori has high hopes and dreams about having the ideal college experience, but when he enters the shop he is sucked into the alcoholic activities of the carefree members of the Diving Club who frequent the place. Persuaded by upperclassmen Shinji Tokita and Ryuujirou Kotobuki, Iori reluctantly joins their bizarre party. His cousin Chisa Kotegawa later walks in and catches him in the act, earning Iori her utter disdain.

Based on Kenji Inoue and Kimitake Yoshioka's popular comedy manga, Grand Blue follows Iori's misadventures with his eccentric new friends as he strives to realize his ideal college dream, while also learning how to scuba dive.

From the start it receives constant praise and love by the masses, unrelenting in their desire to make their short-lived adoration known to any that will hear. For weeks it leads the figurative hype-train that has every seasonal watcher on board in anticipation to see where it ends up. The show you stay up late at night each week just to catch the latest episode on Kis-Crunchyroll.com. While every other show with potential may and probably will squander around the half-way point, this show – THIS SHOW – is the only one

                              This is one of the most boring and unfunny shows that I've ever seen in my life.  
                              ""This is a diving anime... Yes.. Grand Blue is indeed a diving anime only."" - Typical Grand Blue audience.
                              Funniest, hilarious, rolling on the floor laughing....
                              Grand Blue is a Zero-G comedic anime from last year. I can't speak to the quality of their work in general since I only found thirteen titles listed for them and haven't seen any of them. It's based off of a manga by Inoue Kenji. Well, I like a lot of slice of life comedies so this may be relevant to my interests. Let's take a look. 
                              Amazing show, comedy is great and story moves fast
                              ------SPOILER-FREE-------- (It's a comedy anime tho so like idek why I'm saying this)
                              Grand Blue isn't 'breath-hard-out-your-nose' funny, it's a 'hurt-your-stomach' kind of hilarious. Each of the characters are so unique, and I was just captivated by how their different personalities compliment each other to create the funny setting and tone. 
                              - It's a very light and fun anime, the episodes end and you don't even notice. The jokes and situations are great and at many times you laugh a lot.
                              Grand Blue - in search of a sports anime it was no coincidence that I came across this anime that explicitly mentions one of the most beautiful hobbies and sports as part of the story, scuba diving. Since I had not read the manga yet, I did not know what to expect. If my review does not start with the kanji, that's not a good sign. In other words, anyone who likes the anime and hopes to find an echo chamber will be as disappointed as I am of this anime.
                              I don't review many shows but this series in particular really needed one.  It's the true epitome of a ""mixed bag"" show. It has everything in position to be memorable, meaningful, and beautiful. It then throws most of this potential in the trash in favor of the crudest jokes, the most minimal animation and art, and an unfulfilling story.
                              I was feeling a bit down yesterday so I decided to try out a comedy anime for the first time and alas, I feel great and happy. This is how I feel about this anime if I have to put it out in a sentence.
                              Grand Blue are an anime that just really fun to watch and enjoy. Whilst taking a set of college life and a club, the comedy and puns it delivers are just a remarkable one. Despite unfriendly to underage viewers, it was very acceptable and relates more for middle-aged viewer. "
"In the mysterious future, crystalline organisms called Gems inhabit a world that has been destroyed by six meteors. Each Gem is assigned a role in order to fight against the Lunarians, a species who attacks them in order to shatter their bodies and use them as decorations. 

Phosphophyllite, also known as Phos, is a young and fragile Gem who dreams of helping their friends in the war effort. Instead, they are told to compile an encyclopedia because of their delicate condition. After begrudgingly embarking on this task, Phos meets Cinnabar, an intelligent gem who has been relegated to patrolling the isolated island at night because of the corrosive poison their body creates. After seeing how unhappy Cinnabar is, Phos decides to find a role that both of the rejected Gems can enjoy. Houseki no Kuni follows Phos' efforts to be useful and protect their fellow Gems.

                              The GRRM Reaper once posited the Furniture Rule: that at its core, literature is an exploration of the human condition; the rest is fluff, furniture.
                              Over the last few years or so the discussion regarding the use of CGI in anime has grown all the more prominent which in turn has led to disdain from fans, devaluing any show that would dare to use it. This normally wouldn't be a problem, but the overreliance on this technology and the way in which it incorporated with traditional animation, unfortunately, leaves much to be desired. The end product is usually a show that looks bizarre as the two modes of animation don't make clear, visual, coherence sense. CGI is a wonderful tool and I believe it should be used in anime, but          
                              I am writing this review because I believe I hold an uncommon opinion. Don’t worry, it’s spoiler free. Allow me the time to tell you a story.

                              [SPOILER WARNING]
                              Gems are regarded as precious things. There are a plethora of these beautiful, varied jewels, each with distinct colors to catch the eye. Out of this shimmering rouges-gallery, the most popular one may be the diamond. 
                              So Houseki no Kuni. Wow.
                              THIS REVIEW WILL BE SPOILER FREE
                              Note: I have not read the source material (manga), so this review will be based on the anime alone.
                              My only problem with this show is that mainly all of the character development goes into Phos and no one else, which kind of ruined her character for me. As she change too much, too fast and she ended up as a completely different character by the end which I didn’t like. All the other characters in the show either get no development or very little development.
                              Land of the Lustrous is remarkable. At times, it can lull you into a state of awe as you realize how gorgeous a full CG show can be whilst also giving you a sense of fear and danger at the situation the characters find themselves in. This show does both of these things very well. The characters are all made of different kinds of gemstone and this matters as it dictates what role they excel in this society.
                              Beautiful and emotional, 
                              BEAUTIFUL. STUNNING. GORGEOUS. LUSTROUS!  This anime, by far, is the most beautifully animated series I have ever seen.  It is a shining example of how 3D Animation is the future of anime.  I have seen a lot of beautifully animated series in my life, but this one, in my humble opinion, out shined them all.  It was easily the biggest draw of the anime.  I can't ever remember a time where I would rewind just to watch a character run.  But, the animation combined with the motion and camera angles made even running, a spectacular sight.

                              Ah, it's nice to be back in the world of Natsume Yuujinchou. Legitimately, within the first few minutes of experiencing this lovely story, I just felt instantly relaxed and calm. I missed that feeling, so I'm glad I finally got to watch this movie. 
                              I'm going to save you from reading the usual fuzz that you can read in every other review ever on Natsume Yuujinchou. I mean, it's Natsume. You already know what Natsume Yuujinchou is.
                              At last, after almost 9 months from the original release, this movie was subtitled. This movie was honestly really cute, and really gave off that Natsume vibe! So, here I am with my very first review.
                              The movie is basically an arc equivalent to 3-4 episodes of the series.It starts with Natsume returning a name of a youkai from the yuujinchou which initiates a turn of events leading into the plot of the movie.
                              Basically it's a regular series episode that's a bit longer, with even better drawn environments, which is awesome.
                              After a long wait, here it is, the subbed version of the movie we've all been waiting for. (Spoiler-free)
                              Overall Grade: 9
                              The fleeting nature of relationships between youkai and humans has been a recurring theme within Natsume Yuujinchou. It's been explored in various ways, through different perspectives, and Ephemeral Bond is a very welcomed addition to the canon. The closing lines of the fifth season goes, ""We know the flowers' petals will fall someday, and yet still, we are entranced by them."" This perfectly captures a running motif of the show. The risk/inevitability of pain is not enough to outweigh the opportunity to be happy and to live, even if it's only for a moment. It also examines the dichotomy between Natsume and Reiko's opposing philosophies          
                              I'm going to go against the grain and rate this move poorly compared to other people as well as compared to how I would rate the Natsume series overall."

Well, let me start by saying Tenki no Ko is a great continuation of the form that Shinkai's been in for the past decade starting with Garden of Words. The character designs, story, pacing, art, animation and sound are all top notch as to be expected.
                              [This review contains spoilers, because I wasn't able to explain why I didn't like this movie without speaking of specific story events and character roles in the narrative]
                              After having just watched Tenki  no Ko in Koufu, I have decided I'll make this my first review, which I'll make spoiler free and using the categorisation format. I am currently stuck between whether I'd call this movie a 9 or a 10, so as I've only seen it once and don't want to over analyse, enjoyment comes first after all,  I've put the lower to account for that hype we all feel when we first watch an anticipated release. 
                              First of all let me say this
                              When the trailer for Tenki no Ko first released, I think I wasn't the only one who leapt out of my seat and screamed for joy, sharing it on all the social media platforms. The staff lineup was looking quite similar to Kimi no Na wa (Your Name), meaning it could possibly reach the same heights as the film which brought Makoto Shinkai to the spotlight of anime media. I was very hyped for it, and finally got to watch it this weekend, when it released. So how was it?
                              Despite the overwhelming reviews saying that this is a masterpiece, nobody I personally know actually enjoyed this film... We were all disappointed. That's what this movie is major disappointment. 
                              Another beautiful masterpiece created by CoMix Wave Films, a studio that made Kimi no Nawa. and Kotonoha no Niwa. as well as other amazing movies and shows such as Everything Flows and 5 Centimeter. 
                              While Kimi no Na Wa. felt like Makoto Shinkai proving himself to the world, Tenki no Ko feels like the auteur simply being himself-- because it's time for the world to get to know him.
                              ""Weathering with you"" is a plate of spaghetti with very questionable ingredients that seems to be there for the sake of looking good, and despite it's grand presentation complete with truffles and gold plate, you can tell that the presentation is only there to hide it's many flaws, the half-cooked linguine, the hastily cooked sauce and the utter arrogance you can sense from the kitchen, expecting you to forgive all those flaws because of the restaurant's prestige.
                              Hello, this is my first time writing a review on something, I don't know why but I feel the need to write this after watching and reading the review below 7, but don't worry, I'm not here to ignite any argument with you, this is just an opinion from the prespective of a 19 years old.
                              [Spoilers ahead]
                              [No spoilers included]
                              Time to flood this review section with my showering praises! Bad joke sorry. Being serious though, if I want to summarize Tenki no Ko with one phrase, that will be, lacking of confidence to make bold moves. Yes, I actually said that on a film that our best boy, Makoto Shinkai made. He has always made really bold moves on his movie with no drawbacks at all. However, Tenki no Ko felt different. It felt as if he was being nervous when he was producing this film, there was that sense of nervousness inside the story. Not a smart play there, my friend, many people          
                              TLDR Review at the bottom. Hopefully, that helped, in advance.
                              This is Shinkai’s worst film yet. He had a mixed record in the past, from the quality entertainment of Your Name to the embarrassing Studio Ghibli “homage” Children who Chase Lost Voices. But Weathering with You somehow sets the bar even lower. Its unoriginality is pathetic and its self-indulgence repulsive. "

For me, it was everything that a TV series could offer. Therefore, I was excited to hear that Violet Evergarden Gaiden will be coming to theaters in September. After I watched it on the release date in Tokyo, I can safely say that it is a masterpiece in every aspect.
                              Violet Evergarden Gaiden: Eien to Jidou Shuki Ningyou serves as another episode of Violet Evergarden but longer than usual. 

                              ""Violet Evergarden"" is a show that I love since the first time I have seen it. Is creative, is smart, is Sutil, it knows how to make a good drama, the animation is just beautiful. One of my favorite anime (and animation titles in general) of all time, has a 10/10 from me...
                              this is not the best story I have ever seen from the story of ""Violet Evergarden""
                              Violet Evergarden Gaiden is a side story to the main series and this is another tale of Violet's journey during her time as an Auto Memory Doll. Overall this 90-minute movie is a pleasant watch that goes along well with the spirit of the series - telling touching stories about human bonds and emotions, how they are expressed and how it empowers one to change for the better.
                              Minor spoilers to the film and SAO within the review
                              I have generally been a fan of this series, which is both beautifully written and beautifully animated. So this review pertains only to this specific movie and not to the series overall. I still love Violet Evergarden, even through its most sentimental moments. 
                              So here's my spoiler-Free Review:
                              I love this movie. Watching it on theaters was such a beautiful experience. I didn't regret it at all.
                              Literally one of the most beautiful anime movie ever made. (Probably the most beautiful so far.)
                              After the disappointment that was to me Violet Evergarden (TV), I'm pleased to afirm Gaiden is a nice step forward.
                              ヴァイオレット・エヴァーガーデン 外伝 -永遠と自動手記人形-  A wonderful feature-length episode that enchantingly follows in the footsteps of world-famous literature. A superb standalone episode that both visually and narratively engages the viewer with logically and believably developing characters in beautiful and breathtaking art and animation.
                              This is basically like Violet Evergarden : episode 14. 
                              Animation doesn't need much to speak about. Simply, it's as breath taking as what Violet Evergarden has been so far. It's a very slow movie with intimate character interactions. The movie has the same formate as an episode of the show, just played out longer. Violet has her time with the characters, we grow attached, and then we get the background that makes them interesting. Seeing Violet take her affect on the characters, as well as how they effect her is shown very well. It overall a very quiet and calm movie. It has it's very emotional moments, as well and some humor thrown in          "

A tremendously competitive cast of ambitious mangaka—including the wild genius, Eiji Niizuma; the elegant student, Yuriko Aoki, and her older admirer and partner, Takurou Nakai; the lazy prodigy, Kazuya Hiramaru; and the abrasive artist, Shinta Fukuda—both support and compete against Muto Ashirogi in creating the next big hit.

As they adjust to their young and seemingly untested new editor, the dynamic duo struggle to maintain their current serialization, secure the top stop in Shounen Jack, and ultimately, achieve an anime adaptation of their manga. With new rivals and friends, Bakuman. 2nd Season continues Takagi and Mashiro's inspiring story of hard work and young love.

[Written by MAL Rewrite] ",8.4,8,154,490,290097,1382,"                              I had watched the first season along with a few episodes of the second season a while ago, but I had to stop for some reason I can't remember. So, I decided to go back and start the second season from the beginning. Bad idea...
                              Bakuman is both entertaining and educational. It shows that it's not so simple to write or draw something that people will appreciate. If you want to make something truly good, you might have to revise and redo it several times as they do in this series. I like that Bakuman shows how difficult it is; it makes it more realistic. It's still entertaining at an anime level, though, since the characters passionately aim for the top. 
                              First of all let me begin by saying this Anime is written by Tsugumi Ohba and illustrated by Takeshi Obata who made Death Note and unlike some of the other works that have been produced since this anime has the special sauce too. MAYONNAIISEEE.
                              *This review covers Season 2 with Minor Spoilers of Season 1 & 2
                              I can distinguish this series from its prequel and sequel due to some powerful scenes (which I will not spoil). To me, that makes it special, but other people might think the real value is elsewhere.
                              Bakuman season 2 continues the realistic life of a manga artist. What they go through and how they have to deal with them.  Just when things are getting good, something tragic happens and we get to see how the characters handle this situations. 
                              Quote from Mashiro, slight spoiler from episode 25 but for a good reason.
                              Just finishing the first season I fell in love with this series and quickly moved onto the 2nd and folks.....it did not drop the ball in anyway
                              I first started the Bakuman series because it sounded interesting and because it was rated highly; I'm an on and off manga fan, so I didn't think that it would appeal to me, but I was wrong. This led me onto the second series, which I found to be pretty much just as good as the first.
                              Normally, the second season always sucks or it's not as interesting as the first one but... 
                              Bakuman 2 has proven to be an excellent story demonstrating the Tsugumi/Takeshi pair capability to handle another genre of manga/anime. Someone who hasn't done there background look on the creators may not have even noticed it was the same team that brought us the masterpiece, Death Note. The art is very bright and while some mangaka's style can be evidently recognised in all of their work (eg. Mitsuru Adachi), this team's art in Bakuman is much different from the previously produced Death Note. 
                              ""More of the same"" has never rung so true, and yet have been so fulfilling.
                              I am not good at reviews but I will make this short and try not to put spoilers into it.
                              Bakuman is a super realistic lens into the life of mangakas, and considering the fact that the people who made Bakuman is also an artist/author pair -just like the main protagonists-, I wouldn't be surprised if this anime was a remixed story about their life after making Death Note, which is hinted at in season 3. With 3 seasons and 75 episodes, Bakuman is obviously pretty long for a realistic work, and if I were to rank them from best to worst: 3, 2, 1. 
                              And so, the daily lives and struggles of becoming the Number 1# Shounen Jack mangaka goes on...with harsher trials and tribulations for Ashirogi Muto!"
"There exist creatures of darkness and evil that plague the night, devouring any human unfortunate enough to be caught in their grasp. On the other side is Hellsing, an organization dedicated to destroying these supernatural forces that threaten the very existence of humanity. At its head is Integra Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing, who commands a powerful military and spends her life fighting the undead.

Integra's vast army, however, pales in comparison with her ultimate weapon: the vampire Alucard, who works against his own kind as an exterminator for Hellsing. With his new vampire servant, Seras Victoria, at his side, Alucard must battle not only monsters, but all those who stand to oppose Hellsing, be they in the guise of good or evil.

In a battle for mankind's survival, Hellsing Ultimate proves that appearances are not all they may seem, and sometimes the greatest weapon can come in the form of one's worst nightmare.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.4,8,155,143,679502,18227,"                              My friends, 
                              Hellsing Ultimate is genuinely one of the dumbest Anime one would get the displeasure of watching. It boggles the mind how people think this Anime is good or even great by extension, and seeing the amount of praise it gets boggles the mind, as this one suffers from many major problems which cannot be overlooked. So, what are the problems that Hellsing Ultimate suffers from? 
                              Overview:
                              I get sick of shows that are supposedly brutal bloodbaths *very* easily. Why is that? Well I go into it thinking I'm gonna experience just that and instead all I get is a whole lot of bad pacing and tiny little splashes of blood that are heavily censored for no good reason whatsoever with a protagonist that can't shut the fuck up with his bitching. Of course, it's not surprising this is the case since I was spoiled ROTTEN by Hellsing Ultimate. Hellsing Ultimate is the epitome of senseless violence and sheer brutality. Fuck your Mirai Nikki, Deadman Wonderland, and Tokyo Ghoul! THIS is a          
                              I'll keep it sorta brief: this series was pretty shitty. When I started watching it years ago, I thought it was one of the coolest things I ever saw. That gradually shifted to ""What's going on in this story?"" and later ""Why am I even watching this?""
                              Hellsing Ultimate is the definition of badass. From the over-the-top characters to the insane plot to the violent, blood-spewing fights, it is the disregard of all that is holy and possibly the most intense, balls-to-the-wall anime ever made. It’s also the epitome of style over substance, featuring some of the best animation of any series to date, superb voice acting, and a fine soundtrack, but little in terms of plot or character development. It’s Michael Bay doing an anime about Nazi vampires. It’s Japan’s answer to Hellboy. In short, it’s an exquisitely done pure action/horror, but not much else.
                              If there's one word to sum up Hellsing Ultimate, it's 'Style'. The art is gorgeous. The animation is fluid. The fight scenes are well executed with with lots of gore and body parts (as you'd hope for in an adult series about vampires), trash talk, and cool poses, and the imagery is breathtaking.
                              Following my conflicted experience with Hellsing TV, I stumbled onto Studio Madhouse efforts into creating an anime that follows the source material of its manga to a much closer degree. Instead of a standard weekly airing schedule, Madhouse decided to go with releasing a total of ten OVAs over an agonizing long six years. In doing so, they have rectify most of the problems that marred the potential of Gonzo's effort.   
                              Hellsing Ultimate has everything you want and expect from a vampire series revolving around the greatest vampire of them all: Dracula. Only in this series we know him under the name of Alucard. This show is rated R for a reason, a bloody good reason. It contains blood, gore, big breasted female leads and even more blood.
                              Hellsing Ultimate provides the background and plot that was missing in the original Hellsing series.  However, it exchanges a lot of the more intimate moments and character development present in the original series for violence and battle scenes.  There is also a lot more vulgarity present in this version.   The anime presentation style oscillates between more detailed and dark, to lower quality, to classic flat animation during moments that are supposed to be silly.  The switching animation styles works sometimes, but in this series it feels out of place with the overall darkly dangerous atmosphere of the story.  The          
                              If any readers are avid fans of Hellsing, please turn back now. 
                              Have you ever read Bram Stokers Dracula? Have you ever wondered what happened afterwards? If the answer to both of these questions are yes then do I have a show for you, but first I recommend taking an assortment of drugs (much like the creators of this show) to receive the full effect. Do you have your cocaine lines ready? Alright before you make sweet love to that let me tell you my thoughts. 
                              This is actually my first Anime review, and since I am rather new to Anime, I may not look like the most experienced person ever, so be gentle with me. However, I've read some guidelines and know how a good review should actually look like. Let's hope I do well then.
                              THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS UP TO SECOND EPISODE
                              Hellsing Ultimate is a title I remember looking so forward to years ago when I first heard about it, and just about as fast as it piqued my interest upon initial viewing, it sent my expectations crashing down into a ball of flames. In truth, this is one anime I had dropped over a year ago and didn't regret too much doing it. I decided to come back into it very recently through a fresh take and finally finish it. For the most part I wish that my time was better invested somewhere else.  Hellsing Ultimate indeed has plenty of tools to become one          "
"Following the successful Sanyou campaign, the Qin army, including 1,000-Man Commander Li Xin, inches ever closer to fulfilling King Ying Zheng's dream of unifying China. With a major geographical foothold in the state of Wei now under its control, Qin sets its sights eastward toward the remaining warring states.

Meanwhile Li Mu—an unparalleled strategist and the newly appointed prime minister of the state of Zhao—has taken advantage of Zhao's temporary truce with Qin to negotiate with the other states without interruption. Seemingly without warning, Ying Zheng receives news that armies from the states of Chu, Zhao, Wei, Han, Yan, and Qi have crossed into Qin territory. Realizing too late the purpose behind Li Mu's truce with Qin, Zheng quickly gathers his advisors to devise a plan to address the six-state coalition army on their doorstep. For the first time in history, the state of Qin faces complete destruction and must use every resource and strategy at their disposal to prevent themselves from being wiped off the map.

                              Kingdom Is OP From the plot to the action, its an anime that gets your blood pumping and ready for action I 100% recommend this to everyone. 
                              This is my first ever anime review, I feel I have to give this anime credit where credit is due because it is the most underrated anime I have ever had the pleasure of watching, do not let the lack of reviews/popularity fool you, it is one of the best animes I have seen. 
                              This is far from a 9 or 10
                              Season 3 of Kingdoms absolutely nailed it!!! S3 starts almost immediately after the military and political events after S2 so i consider it a direct sequel to S2 a few years back. What suprised me in S3 is that the anime jumps right into the plot and military action, no unnecessary fillers, or overly emotional moments. The animation is even better than that of S2 which was already a lot better compared to the bad animation of the first Season of Kingdoms.
                                 I very much enjoy this season over the last 2 seasons. There is no CGI and it is completely hand-drawn which is very good (the CGI was trash in the last two seasons). The 2D animation I feel is pretty good, I had a bit of whiplash getting used to the new style but once you do it feels like a huge improvement over the last two seasons. "
"All of a sudden, they arrived: parasitic aliens that descended upon Earth and quickly infiltrated humanity by burrowing into the brains of vulnerable targets. These insatiable beings acquire full control of their host and are able to morph into a variety of forms in order to feed on unsuspecting prey.

Sixteen-year-old high school student Shinichi Izumi falls victim to one of these parasites, but it fails to take over his brain, ending up in his right hand instead. Unable to relocate, the parasite, now named Migi, has no choice but to rely on Shinichi in order to stay alive. Thus, the pair is forced into an uneasy coexistence and must defend themselves from hostile parasites that hope to eradicate this new threat to their species.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.4,8,158,40,1263719,26745,"                              I'm the type of anime watcher that likes to wait for the anime to be completed before watching it; so I can either marathon it in one day or finish it in a few days - am I the only one who does this? Parasyte or Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu was one of those anime I've completed in a day. With the cliffhangers that leave you at the edge of your seat at the end of the episodes, to the humans that can morph into blades and mold their faces/ bodies for creating massacres; it's the perfect formula for binge watching. I would have been          
                              You’ve probably heard of them in classic sci-fi stories before; the very idea of alien creatures who can snatch bodies to impersonate a human and walk among our society. Build on the foundation of a science fiction and body horror, Kiseijuu (also known as Parasyte) takes a full swing with its premise. It’s simple actually. We have a case of alien invasion by mysterious beings who can infect us through parasitic means. By inserting themselves into a human’s brain, the parasites can take full control and transform you into a monster. Not only does this kill the victim but now it can even add more          
                              Based off of the award winning manga series written by Iwaaki Hitoshi, coming from the highly praised Madhouse studio, with all excitement and intense story, Kiseijuu constantly finished this season with its fineness.
                              If Tokyo Ghoul is fast food then Parasyte is fine dining.
                              I remember hearing a lot of hype for Parasyte when it was first announced for an anime adaptation. Apparently, it was a really popular manga in the 90s about some kid who got his hand infected by an alien parasite – hence the name I suppose, although I’m not sure why the “i” was changed into a “y” – and must now learn to live with it whilst warding off other similar infected people who had the misfortune of being killed by these beings before having their entire existence taken over. Seemed like good body horror stuff as is, but then came the influx of

                              With a show like this, it's easy to see how much time and care has gone into making it succeed. Kiseijuu has so many genres and elements to it, however rather than it becoming a huge mess, it executes every single one perfectly. 
                              What makes a human? What makes a monster? Each of us have a bit of both in us, and it's up to you which one you want to be.

                              Me: Whats a parasite? Where do they come from?
                              Parasyte the Maxim is a story that handles questions about what makes us human, taking us on an unforgettable horror-adventure in the process.
                              There could not have been a more fitting end. Shinichi and Migi's dream in the final episode, along with the internal monologue life preaching that followed immediately after (consisting of HALF the sodding episode!), aptly summarised everything wrong with an anime that may as well have been titled 'Parasyte: Maximum Chatter Within'. It was telling that, with the chance to have AN ACTUAL CONVERSATION outside of Shinichi's head, instead the last exchange between the two characters played out internally. Migi said it was because he (genderless, but forever a bro) wanted Shinichi to forget. And I most certainly agreed with Migi's sentiment. 
                                    There are a few categories of anime that tend to gain mass appeal simply because of what they are. Examples include run-of-the-mill Shounens, Key adaptations, “Oh no I’m trapped in a video game!!” series, and action-horror anime that are filled with gore for good measure. Due to the recent disaster known as Tokyo Ghoul, I initially brushed Parasyte to the side dismissing it as another horror clone. For the first 12 episodes or so, I held my pinky in the air and avoided Parasyte like the plague. However, I finally caved to the hype. After marathoning the first half          
                              When this anime was airing, I had over 10 different animes that I was watching, and during that time this anime was my most favorite one. Even for a harem genre lover such as myself, I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy it as I watched despite the lack of nosebleeds.
                              Parasyte, a really hyped about anime when it started airing. Is the hype worth it? or is it just another exaggerated anime? I can't say. But as far as my biased opinion about this anime is concerned, I think this is a pretty good anime as far as story, setting and a new idea is concerned. Horror, there isn't much of it, just some people getting sliced up."

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.4,8,159,359,375115,2555,"                              It's getting increasingly hard to care about Shaft as an animation studio. Ever since Madoka Magica, they've done nothing but play it safe, churning out sequels to their popular stuff again and again until they became the anime studio version of Nintendo, whilst all their new IP have been so mediocre that with the exception of Nisekoi, nobody remembers them anymore. Not helping is the fact that after so many years, they STILL haven't ditched that outdated Shinbou-animation style that quite frankly looks about as exciting to watch as the same tech demo done on Unreal Engine. Sure it's pretty to look at, but it          
                              Kizumonogatari Tekketsu-hen is a truly sublime experience, an expertly crafted intense mood piece that encapsulates the ideological perspectives and meanderings of the coming-of-age character, such as is Araragi Koyomi; this is all portrayed in a very bloody folklore/supernatural tale complete with limbless vampires, a deus ex machina Hawaiin shirt wearing dude, head-patting, burning corpses, porn magazines, train metaphors, lots of crows masquerading as metaphors, and through sexualized imagery of PANTIES!!! 
                              Ok, I'm not sure what movie the majority of reviewers online watched, but Kizmonogatari (Part 1) was AWFUL. Basically it was boobs bouncing, Araragi sweating/screaming/running, and a bunch of 3D backgrounds that didn't look right with the 2D animated characters. It honestly feels like the creators said ""Ok, time to stretch 20 minutes of plot into 60 minutes. Let's make Araragi gasp and scream and flail for a 20 minute scene."" They wasted so much time under the guise of suspense that when the ""thing"" actually happened, I was bored, not intrigued or excited. By the time the movie actually got interesting, it was over.          
                              Kizumonogatari is, in short, ""A story where no-one ends up happy."".
                              So before I start this my overall view of the show is that a fan of the monogatari series should see it but not pay any money for it because it is bad, really bad. As someone else said there actually 15-20 minutes of actual content stretched over one hour. The main impression the movie made on me was that of young art school student who tries to impress too much. So without delay these are my points against this movie:
                              I remember right after watching the first episode of Owarimonogatari that the trailer for this movie had finally been released.  It looked really good from what I could see, as expected of Shaft.  However, it turned out that Kizumonogatari would be split into three movies which either meant that the studio was trying to do the story justice by giving the full adaptation.  Or, that Shaft was simply only trying to milk the series for what it was worth giving the amount of hype built up over the last couple years.  After watching the movie, I can gladly say it's more          
                              After putting it off for so long and reading (and listening to) the Light Novel a few months ago, I am utterly disappointed and shocked by this first part of Kizumonogatari.
                              Few spoilers ahead**
                              What can I possibly say about this movie? As a monogatari fan, this movie (as well as the other 2 parts of kizu) was absolutely amazing from start to finish in different ways, from the story, characters, animation and music
                              Kizumonogatari was probably the most original and entertaining story about vampires that I read in my life. I did not read much of them. But most were similar. And now finally we have a screen version of the novel.
                              I’m in a unique position, in relation to how people usually view this franchise. I’ve seen pretty much nothing of Monogatari as a series, sans a few early episodes of Bakemonogatari. All I know is that Kizu takes place at the very start of the series, and features a somewhat different style and approach the series overall. I'd heard about how good the Kizumonogatari films were meant to be, and I've always been a little drawn to anime films rather then TV series - so, I dove in, expecting just a feature-length version of what I'd seen in Bakemonogatari.
                              Bloody Brilliant – Kizumonogatari Part 1
                              (8.5/10)
                              Story:
                              The first Kizumonogatari movie can be summed up succinctly in two phrases: pretent- ahem arthouse, and a virgin's perverse wet dream. The art is certainly atmospheric, weaving in the bold color panels and shadow crush the Monogatari series is known for with creatively placed textures and CGI; parts of it seem lifted out of print media together with the moire. The animation is distorted, movements exaggerated -- emotional, to make up for the lack of characterization. It feels very similar to Mind Game, directed by the Masaaki Yuasa of Tatami Galaxy fame. Masaaki is not associated with this work."

Mostly, that's because all too often a film of a series consists of some kind of edited-all-to-hell clip show that tries and totally fails to boil down the story of a long series to a relatively much shorter film.  Knockin' on Heaven's Door isn't that, which is very much in its favour.  Rather, it's basically like a two-hour &quot;lost episode&quot; that belongs somewhere in the middle of the series - without spoiling anything, by the end of the series, there's characters missing who are still present in this film.
                              It was a good follow up (in-between, actually) to the series. I suggest that if you’re planning to watch Cowboy Bebop – Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door, you should watch after you get to the episode when Ed is introduced. You just need to get to know all 4 major characters to understand the movie.
                              Warning : minor spoilers ahead
                              Overview:
                              Story:
                              Meant to take place between episodes 22 and 23 of the series, ""Cowboy Bebop - Knockin' on Heaven's Door"" is just like an extra long episode of ""Cowboy Bebop"". It's got the same style, same humour, and even the same underlying melancholic feel. The production somehow manages to look even more expensive than the production of old, with the crisp animation shining through especially, featuring some fluid, breathtaking action sequences that's at least as good as anything in the series.
                              Cowboy Bebop: Knockin' On Heaven's Door (retitled in America as simply Cowboy Bebop: The Movie) is the full-length feature film based on the show of the same name.
                              O.K., let's face it; I haven't seen Cowboy Bebop: The Movie in a very long time now and let's note that I am a HUGE Cowboy Bebop fan and was quite disappointed to see the movie on television and say that it just wasn't my cup of tea. 
                              Okay guys, what's up all... It's 5:21pm as I'm writing this.  What i have to say I was a little disappointed to see little in the way of either cowboys or dancing in the feature of the same name (which came out in Japan in 2001, but hit U.S. theaters briefly in the spring of 2003), but that's ultimately probably for the best. In the world of Cowboy Bebop, it's the year 2071, a time when the Earth has become almost uninhabitable and everyone has moved out to other planets in the solar system, like Mars. The plucky little band of bounty hunters who          
                              It's a good film no doubt but it's definitely a bit too long. It plays like an extended TV episode (which isn't necessarily a bad thing) but unfortunately it isn't up there with the best episodes to be found in the series. Still it's always good to see Spike and the gang in action seeing as it looks like there isn't going to be a new series made anytime soon for obvious reasons! Its very stylised and is fantastically shot but it seems to drag at times. It would have been nice if it could've linked in a bit more of the Vicious/Julia/Spike backstory into          
                              I've been on a roll with this Cowboy Bebop show. Just finished the series earlier today, and now I'm done with the film. Let's jump into this review!
                              Three years after the conclusion of Cowboy Bebop, we return once more to the futuristic world of Spike Spiegel and his fellow bounty hunters to solve one last bounty, one that boasts the highest stakes of them all. Tengoku no Tobira challenges the conventions of an ""anime film"" by serving as a proper, standalone addition to a well-renowned, richly developed universe. 
                              Cowboy Bebop Knocking on heavens door is an outstanding film that will always have a place in my top movies.  
                              So the Cowboy Bebop basically got all the parts that the TV show didn't really capture, Spike is a cool guy at the forefront of a major kind of planetary issue, and it's cool to be on his side. Unlike the show, it plays up his charming and suave compassion/skill and less his burdened past and all that. "
"After their triumphant victory over Shiratorizawa Academy, the Karasuno High School volleyball team has earned their long-awaited ticket to nationals. As preparations begin, genius setter Tobio Kageyama is invited to the All-Japan Youth Training Camp to play alongside fellow nationally recognized players. Meanwhile, Kei Tsukishima is invited to a special rookie training camp for first-years within the Miyagi Prefecture. Not receiving any invitations himself, the enthusiastic Shouyou Hinata feels left behind.

However, Hinata does not back down. Transforming his frustration into self-motivation, he boldly decides to sneak himself into the same rookie training camp as Tsukishima. Even though Hinata only lands himself a job as the ball boy, he comes to see this as a golden opportunity. He begins to not only reflect on his skills as a volleyball player but also analyze the plethora of information available on the court and how he can apply it.

As the much-anticipated national tournament approaches, the members of Karasuno's volleyball team attempt to overcome their weak points and refine their skills, all while aiming for the top!

                              Perhaps this is selfish, as I don’t interact with the community enough to know if this opinion is shared, but to me, the enduring appeal of seasons one through three of Haikyuu!!—putting aside, for now, its outstandingly high quality production—was in the fact it was the first and only shounen anime which did not feel like it was meant to go on forever. All shounen manga as serialized in Weekly Shounen Jump are literally, in-the-text, meant to go on forever. By design of the publication, volume sales and product sales are of secondary importance to by-vote audience reception, which would honestly be kind of cool          
                              Welcome to a new chapter of “I could never have imagined a volleyball anime could be this good”
                              Haikyuu is still as amazing as ever.
                              Yo. So far I’ve written reviews for every season of Haikyuu! and figured I’d keep it going. Most of the times I have been critical, but it’s been hard for me to figure out why I haven’t liked Haikyuu without saying “I just think it’s overrated”. I think this time I actually know why: It tries way too hard. 
                              To start off this review, I'd like to say that I've seen quite a few people complaining about this season. The main complaints seem to be about the animation and the lack of action.
                              Hot damn, it's back, baby! I gotta say, I found myself staying up-to-date with the manga, so I can't really talk much in this review about the story content because, well, I already knew what it would be; that being said, I'm still really excited to review this season of Haikyuu!! now that it's finally been animated. 
                              OKAY.... this season was amazingggg!!!! As a haikyuu fan that only watches the anime and not the manga, i was very excited to watch this season when it fully finished airing. Honestly, with the previous seasons i always thought that Hinata wasn't as good as I wanted him to be. He may have fast reflexes and at moments he may surprise you but his basic skills were not there. In this season, it mainly focuses on the character development of Hinata. There weren't many volleyball matches( there is a continuation of season 4 that will have nationals though c:), but I truly loved seeing him          
                              *Minimum Spoiler Review*
                              Haikyuu is my favorite sports anime. [haven’t watched hajime no ippo yet]
                              Preface: the review will likely be long and have a lot of grammar mistakes. Proofreading is too boring, so forgive me for that. Anyway, onto the review.
                              I will keep it short. I enjoyed this season, while they lack some elements from first one they improved others. It may be not tense as 3rd but games are still fun to watch.
                              The fourth season of Haikyuu. Story-wise, there are nothing really major this season. I like to think that this season is the part where they focus on character development, we get to see a lot of character development stories this season. This season is sort of a build-up to the main story in Part 2 later.
                              I gave this an overall 6/10. I really liked season's 1-3, it had a great story, intro music and the characters were great. However season 4 'to the top' wasn't great, I didn't like the change in art style as it seemed incomplete almost, 1 of the games took up 90% of the season and I wasn't satisfied about how the season ended. It was mediocre and the only reason I watched it was because of the story, other than that there was no enjoyment for me. Although I do recommend watching the other seasons. Overall it wasn't great and I didn't think it lived          
                              It'd be hard no matter what happened to follow up the adrenaline rush of the Shiratorizawa match. This season continues to develop the dynamics between the teammates and those they practice with, and Hinata continues to be a compelling character you just wanna cheer on. Other characters that sort of went by the wayside previously are also given some development and setup for later development (potentially). Speaking of, romance is typically played off as a joke in shounen, so it'd be interesting to see it go somewhere other than a punchline. Outside of that, a significant portion of this season didn't so much feel as          "

                              The kingdom series is so precious and sentimental to me now that my only regret was not finding out about it sooner. The emotions welling up inside of me  are so powerful that I'm going out of my way to write this review.

                              Overall I do rate this an 8 which is pretty high by my standards
                              Story - 10/10
                              Kingdom could really be described as one of those Anime’s that nearly reached perfection but lacked an element or two un-allowing it to do so. I absolutely loved everything about Kingdom; however you do have to make it past the first 12 episodes or so to get to the real action. Note: I don’t know anything about China’s history so I won’t be talking about the history element of this Anime in the review.
                              Kingdom 2nd Season (Dub) Review
                              Intro: This 2nd season is both better and worse than season 1, but overall it is weaker.
                              Overall 1 because im bad at maths
                              Kingdom is it's own title all about war, to the social hierarchy of peasants to nobles and to the middle it's generals it so great personalities. Not at all for Xin who had an intelligent friend and then a King who becomes his friend but he seems not to grow up and still doesn't present a bit of calmness of assertiveness, still it 2 intelligent friends. Not enough for his lack of CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT, he observes battles, has seem what a general is; leader and strategic but Xin is only angry and angry and was no experience for what he was gone through it Wang          
                              Kingdom's manga is my favourite ongoing manga lately but it's anime adaptation is almost a complete fail. Don't let yourself fooled by it's high rating! "
"Many years before becoming the famed captain of the Survey Corps, a young Levi struggles to survive in the capital's garbage dump, the Underground. As the boss of his own criminal operation, Levi attempts to get by with meager earnings while aided by fellow criminals, Isabel Magnolia and Farlan Church. With little hope for the future, Levi accepts a deal from the anti-expedition faction leader Nicholas Lobov, who promises the trio citizenship aboveground if they are able to successfully assassinate Erwin Smith, a squad leader of the Survey Corps.

As Levi and Erwin cross paths, Erwin acknowledges Levi's agility and skill and gives him the option to either become part of the expedition team, or be turned over to the Military Police, to atone for his crimes. Now closer to the man they are tasked to kill, the group plans to complete their mission and save themselves from a grim demise in the dim recesses of their past home. However, they are about to learn that the surface world is not as liberating as they had thought and that sometimes, freedom can come at a heavy price.

Based on the popular spin-off manga of the same name, Shingeki no Kyojin: Kuinaki Sentaku illustrates the encounter between two of Shingeki no Kyojin's pivotal characters, as well as the events of the 23rd expedition beyond the walls.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.39,8,163,423,329043,1898,"                              I have been looking forward to watching this OVA, as soon as i heard it was being made.
                              Shingeki no Kyojin: No Regrets/Kuinaku Sentaku is  a spin-off of the ever popular Attack on Titan on which our beloved supporting character Levi finally gets a main role.  This shows the flashback of Levi before joining the Survey Corps. You don't really need to watch AOT first if you want to watch this. 

                                At first I was very bored of the whole OVA thing. They aren't really tied to the main story that significantly so why bother?
                              Alright, since the other reviews mostly summarize what we already know, I'm going to write down my thoughts on what I think works and why it did, and what I think doesn't work and why it didn't. I'll try my best to be as vague as possible to avoid spoilers, but I'll post warnings just in case. 
                              This is probably the best content in the AOT universe, and beyond a shadow of a doubt the best OVA produced in the series. The preface, I am NOT an AOT stan, I actually dropped the show after the 1st season and didn't pick it up again till my friends started gushing about the 3rd season. I started No regrets by mistake after clicking on the wrong hyperlink and I'm so glad I did, because no regrets is a masterpiece in every definition of the word.
                              Everybody knows Attack on Titan, but does everybody recognize Attack on Titan for what it is?
                              The ova fails both in storytelling and characterization.
                              I just finished it, and i dont make many reviews. I rarely make one sinc eim not the best XD its so hard to get your feels out there! 
                              ""Everyone saw your fight. You've given them hope that Humans don't have to lose to the Titans if we fight correctly. It was really outstanding!""
                              Warning possible Spoilers
                              Sometimes, gaining trust and loyalty comes with a heavy price. 
                              It is an enjoyable anime that gives a glimse of one of Attack on Titan's favorite character Levi's past. I find it interesting to see how the Underground works and looks.
                              It is a crime that these two episodes were not included in the main show. While you do get some of Levi's backstory later in season 3, rewatching the show after watching these two episodes made me appreciate Levi and Erwin as characters so much more.
                                  I have got to say that ever since I read the manga and found out about the release of this OVA I've been anxiously waiting for the occasion to watch it. It's hard to say that the story impressed me, and you'll see for yourself whether you think the same or not. Of course, nothing can beat the ingenuity of the titan-related stuff, not even something from Levi's mysterious past, although we get to see a side of him that we didn't really get a glimpse of in the original anime. The other characters play an important role in his development,          "
"Justice, and the enforcement of it, has changed. In the 22nd century, Japan enforces the Sibyl System, an objective means of determining the threat level of each citizen by examining their mental state for signs of criminal intent, known as their Psycho-Pass. Inspectors uphold the law by subjugating, often with lethal force, anyone harboring the slightest ill-will; alongside them are Enforcers, jaded Inspectors that have become latent criminals, granted relative freedom in exchange for carrying out the Inspectors' dirty work.

Into this world steps Akane Tsunemori, a young woman with an honest desire to uphold justice. However, as she works alongside veteran Enforcer Shinya Kougami, she soon learns that the Sibyl System's judgments are not as perfect as her fellow Inspectors assume. With everything she has known turned on its head, Akane wrestles with the question of what justice truly is, and whether it can be upheld through the use of a system that may already be corrupt.

But I didn't find the anime to be anything more than your run of the mill dark themed series. Before throwing off my review as a hated one, I would appreciate it if you guys just took a couple of minutes to read what I thought of Psycho Pass
                              There is nothing more undefined, blurry, and vague than the line that separates ""good"" from ""bad"". What complicates the matter further is the question of ""is said action more bad/good than another?"" Why do we consider the murder of an innocent person a worse offense compared to something like a bank robbery? Is a doctor who saves hundreds of lives more ""good"" than a simple volunteer at a homeless shelter? While Psycho Pass may not be a realistic representation of today's societal state, the observation of human morals, psychological concepts, and fluctuation of emotions can all be applied to our methodology of thinking and our          
                              After watching this series twice within a short amount of time (a month or so) and still enjoying it to the fullest, I felt compelled to finally write my first MAL review. 
                              Crime is a constant in human civilization. Theft, murder, and countless other atrocities have been committed  by people in every civilization throughout history; try as we might, humans have always had trouble preventing crimes from happening, let lone eliminating them completely. However, what if advancement in technology eventually provided a system that could accurately assess a person's capacity to commit a crime? That is the question posed in Production I.G.'s dystopian sci-fi crime thriller Psycho-Pass: a searing, violent, and ambitious exploration of crime, justice, and the system that judges which is right in a society. Filled with interesting concepts, it is unfortunate that the          
                              Hey you, turn on the news. 
                              Urobuchi Gen certainly made name for himself during last couple seasons. Known for his dark and edgy, sometimes nihilistic approach to writing that leaves trail of bodies and broken characters, it's hard to overlook his works. His works of Fate/zero and Madoka, that definitively left impact on anime scene for better or worse, coupled with Production I.G. creative history of making Ghost in the Shell franchise, made me hope that we would get darker, more Urobuchi-like version of GitS, something I would definitively enjoy a lot. Unfortunately, it didn't take too long to me to get disillusioned that such dream wouldn't come true due to          
                              It has been a while since there has been a dystopian, psychological, police thriller of this popularity since Ghost in The Shell first aired. Writer Urobuchi Gen, famous for his works on the Fate/Stay Night series, and Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica, decided to use his deft hand at writing and give us his own twisted version of the future. Psycho Pass is a dystopian crime thriller, centered around human morality. Is it right to sacrifice individual freedom, for safety? Is it right to condemn someone for something they might do? 
                              ""It's not the final judgement of ""good"" and ""evil"" that's important. What matters is that you come to that decision yourself. That you agonize over it and eventually accept it."" -Akane Tsunemori
                              The Butcher strikes again with an intense action set in a chilling dystopia that, regrettably, is one of his weakest works.
                              In short, ""Psycho Pass"" is a weak, pretentious and utterly misguided show. There are two main reasons for that. First - very general failure of the show in constructing a sensible futuristic vision and second - its not exactly superb writing.
                              *Somewhat spoilerish materials in this review. I will try to fix that as I continue to grow as a writer!*
                              To me, Psycho-Pass was great largely because of its world. The basic premise is ""What if we could tell criminal minds apart from normal ones?"", and in the show, the conclusion of this is that the governmental Sibyl System aggressively monitors your mental state, so that they can arrest or execute you provided you are sufficiently criminal. 
                              I'm gonna keep this brief: Watch this series. Fortunately I wasn't someone who started watching the show when it first aired, because goddamn, the hype and cliffhangers from episode to episode would have driven me crazy. Anyways, if I need to justify why this series is very good, here ya go. 
                              In our modern world, society is essentially the dictator of all law and judgement. A justice system, in reality, is merely a representation of what we as a society believe is ""right"" or ""wrong"". People who step outside this box, are often penalized - at the most extreme point, we refer to these people as criminals.
                              Once in a while, there comes along an anime that claims to go against the industry's trend. An anime that claims to be unique in a time when the market is filled mostly with indistinguishable moe clones and so on. This is a very good marketing strategy for Psycho Pass if you ask me, especially given the gorgeous artwork and an exciting concept. In addition to this, it was touted as the 'next GITS'. Needless to say, I picked this up with VERY HIGH expectations.  expectations which were about to come crashing down faster than you could say 'psychopath'. "

That’s the simple way to say it but the complicated way is explaining it from my perspective. To be fair, I think this anime gets judged based on a lot of facts before it even aired. Like for instance, the brainchild behind the light novels is the same person that made Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo. (The Pet girl of Sakurasou) Anyone who has seen that anime may think what to expect from this show. But I think a bit differently. Hajime Kamoshida helmed the          
                              This is my first and probably last review on MAL. I think there are a couple of things to say about this anime which are not said yet. I don't want to go to much into detail so it would be better you have watched the anime before reading this.
                              The challenges we face during our adolescence may be irrelevant in the grand scheme of things, though their magnitude in the moment can feel overwhelming. It's no surprise then that media which intensifies these issues through supernatural phenomenon would be popular, since teenage audiences feel as if the weight of their problems is understood. However, does this media actually help its audience to overcome their problems, or is it merely wish fulfillment to escape from them? Seishun Buta Yarou may have something compelling to say about the adolescent experience, but it's unfortunately buried under layers of tropes and cliches.
                              The fall 18 anime season was great. Compare to the unfortunate lacklustre Summer 18 anime season it was the season that gave us back to back great titles that I consider anime of the year material such as theses following anime.

                              I consider myself diverse in what i have watched in my anime life. This, is simply amazing.
                              This is my first review and as such won't be as refined but some things I'd like to point out about this show. I liked it.
                              Wow. Now that it's over, I've got a lot to talk about. This show was one of the best ones to air this year, and it's got a lot to back it up. Everything from the opening to the character arcs shows that there was a lot of care and effort put into this show.
                              [5.0/10]
                              Im sure theres  a lot of high school romance anime's out there and most of them have the same old generic plot, but to me this anime articulacy stood out a lot over the rest of the stuff that was airing, there were other romance anime too but this was something else.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.37,8,169,492,289523,4648,"                              Great Pretender was exceptionally disappointing. What I thought to be watching was a modern Lupin, it ended becoming the classic 'predictable but not fun' kind of story. I wanted to like it and say originals aren't always bad... I couldn't.
                              I have never felt so compelled to write a review about an anime until I watched the end of Great Pretender. 
                              We will, we will mislead you.
                              Great Pretender has a decent soundtrack, and the art is quite pleasing, but these things don't matter when the story is poor. The emotional/dramatic scenes were well done, but I couldn't take it seriously knowing how absurd the plot was. If you don't get too hung up on how well the plot is written, you might enjoy it, but it was dreadful for me.
                              Man, in all of my years watching anime, I've never watched such a good show that left me with such a bad taste in my mouth. Before I get into the meat and potatoes of my review, let me first say that I will try to avoid spoilers for those of you who aren't watching the sub online off of Netflix, since the final arc isn't available on US Netflix yet. Furthermore, a lot of my harsher scores in the story, character, and enjoyment areas are heavily influenced by the final arc, and especially the ending, so if you don't want to be jaded before          
                              TLDR Review at the bottom. Hopefully, that helped, thank you for reading it in advance.
                              THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS
                              People often like to dramatize how they feel about any given show for the sake of being theatrical, but I'm telling the truth when I say that the Great Pretender is one the best, and most dissapointing anime I've seen.
                              I haven't seen any comments about Great Pretender yet, but I can already foresee the many free praise for his art, which consists of a palette of colors quite different from the usual, but which does not suit the unity of the rest of the work at all.
                              The Great Pretender was fucking incredible. Without getting into spoiler territory, all I can really say is... it's one of the smartest anime out there. I know I sound like a goddamned Rick and Morty fan when I say that, but believe me. Everything about is top notch. The animation is incredible, the characters are realistic and relatable, and most importantly, the heists are incredibly well thought out. It's definitely worth your time.
                              Great Pretender was an anime i was excited to watch due to Wit Studio and the general hype around it. After waiting a few months due to work, i finished the anime and boy was i disappointed. The anime is essentially a ""i predicted this prediction to happen"" and everything goes all according to Laurent's plan. I am aware it's an anime but the general ""villains"" of the anime are essentially robots taking orders from Laurent as they do everything according to plan. It doesn't exactly help that they throw away the whole plot of the anime at the final episode where Edamura magically has          
                              I loved the Show it was suspenseful fun, and is great for a binge watch or a slow burn. One of the only bad things that I can say about the show is that one or 2 of the episodes feels repetitive. But after that it keeps its momentum. The characters were cool, and a the main character is a so enjoyable to see him scheme fail, and succeed.  if you like shows like kakeguri, kaiji, or other suspense filled shows this will quickly become an all time favorite. The art is amazing every establishing shot, or just a still from an episode is          
                              Story-9
                              Well this is definitely a great revenge story(kind off).
                              Great Pretender is a masterclass in weaving a spider’s web of intricacies, all intended to dispatch a missive to an interconnected, worldwide audience, thrilled by the conceits of exploitation and retribution, whilst concurrently lacking understanding of our inherent malleability and tendency to form absolute judgements without successive evaluation.

It will charm you with it's great visuals and a beautifully composed soundtrack, and that's pretty much it for me. If this sounds like something you'll like... good, go watch Natsume's Book of Friends or Garden of Words, both of them way more worth your time then this. 
                              I am not great at writing reviews, but I am trying to get better so please bare with me on this one. Hope you like my review though ^^ ok so lets get on with it.
                              *SPOILER WARNING*
                              From the same creator of the ever calm ""Natsume Yuujinchou"" series comes ""Hotarubi no Mori e,"" a tale of the developing friendship between a young girl, Hotaru, and her youkai companion, Gin. Through brief glimpses at their time spent together once a year in the summer, viewers witness the passage of time and the changing of seasons, and the growing bonds that develop as the young girl grows up, while her youkai companion remains relatively the same. Even though this difference in age is negligible in her younger days, it becomes an increasing problem as she grows older. 
                              From the same mangaka that wrote Natsume Yuujinchou, being adapted by the same animation studio that brought you Natsume Yuujinchou, directed by the same man who directed Natsume Yuujinchou. Would you believe then, that this is nothing like Natsume Yuujinchou? That it is, in fact, a rip-roaring action-packed adventure flick as the main characters ride wave after wave of explosions and cynical social satire? Of course you wouldn't believe it because you're not gullible. This is just Natsume Yuujinchou the Rather Short Movie.
                              No spoilers.
                              Hotarubi no Mori e is a relatively short movie that attempts to portray the developing relationship between a young girl and a spirit who stumbles upon said young girl in a forest.
                              I have no words to describe this anime. To me, this anime is nothing short of perfection. This movie cements anime  as a legitmate form of art in my opinion.
                              Want forty-four minutes of sadness and happiness mixed into a ball just for you?
                              So much to say about that one great first love. Since time immemorial, first love has always filled our hearts with longing and nostalgia and that is where Hotarubi no Mori e hits home.
                               I heard a lot about Hotarubi no Mori e for its great story, despite it being so short (45 minutes). It was a movie that people deemed was almost equal to others like 5 Centimeters per Second. I finally watched it after my friend pushed and pushed me to see it and I was definitely not disappointed. 
                              There is a metaphor that speaks of two parallel lines that have many in common but never meet...but there is another that really graced this movie dearly.
                              9/10
                              I stumbled upon this anime by pure coincidence while I was searching for something similar to Mushishi. Since it had only one episode, I thought to myself: I will give it a go. Needless to say, I was not dissapointed. It is truly great, but extremely sad. I cried like a baby during the last 10-15 minutes. Seriously, it is devastating. From my point of view at least. It is about love that can never become reality because even the slightest touch by a human will make him disappear. The story is simple, the characters are well thought out, but it is really so sad.

                              This anime was so good(all the seasons not just the last) that when i finished it i just sat staring at the screen because I just didnt know what to do. I am not a fan of baseball in real life but this anime is so good it didnt even matter, I didnt enjoy the first season as much because i felt like he was an annoying kid, but by the end you feel like you grew up with him and you get attached. I really enjoyed the show and i would recommend to everyone(although it is a bit long and could take a long

"Despite being bullied, scorned, and oppressed all of his life, a thirty-four-year-old shut-in still found the resolve to attempt something heroic—only for it to end in a tragic accident. But in a twist of fate, he awakens in another world as Rudeus Greyrat, starting life again as a baby born to two loving parents.

Preserving his memories and knowledge from his previous life, Rudeus quickly adapts to his new environment. With the mind of a grown adult, he starts to display magical talent that exceeds all expectations, honing his skill with the help of a mage named Roxy Migurdia. Rudeus learns swordplay from his father, Paul, and meets Sylphiette, a girl his age who quickly becomes his closest friend.

As Rudeus' second chance at life begins, he tries to make the most of his new opportunity while conquering his traumatic past. And perhaps, one day, he may find the one thing he could not find in his old world—love.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.37,8,172,439,319566,5406,"                              2021 is definitely a year that will be monopolized by Fantasy animes, and honestly, if most of them are like ""Mushoku Tensei"" I really don't mind. Competing with ""Tensura S02"" and ""So I'm a Spider, So What?"" Mushoku Tensei easily (in my opinion) outstands them with better character development and amazing art. They actually make you feel bad about the main character with his past life being so fucked up and seeing him in this new life overwhelming his fears gets you closer to the story. Something we can say other ""Reincarnation"" type animes definitely fail at. 
                              A story about a middle-aged pedophile that is reincarnated in a fantasy world where everything is conveniently set up so he can make all his pedo dreams come true without the legal and moral obstacles of the modern world.
                              I went in blind when I started this show. Didn't know anything about it, and was pleasant surprised by how good it is. It's charming, funny, and gives you interesting characters for sure. Defo one of the better isekai's for sure, and for good reason.
                              I haven't seen such a mess for ages. For real I don't know why this good looking shit has so high score. But lets go:
                              I know that I can't analyze the anime exactly by watching only 4 episodes, but this is my initial conclusion: 
                              This show was one of my more anticipated of the season going into it. Isekai stories are a fair bit played out at this point, but I really liked the nuance it seemed to be giving as to what made this rebirth a second chance. delving into topics such as mental trauma and overcoming obstacles of a more personal nature then your typical fantasy wish filament story. The only problem is those topics, as well as others of a more serious nature, are handled with the delicacy of drop kicking a baby down a flight of stairs. 
                              SO I'm a little biased because I have read the manga and Web Novel. BUT. I have to give this story a 10/10 as of right now and here's why.
                              Mushoku Tensei is a superbly well animated garbage. That is the reason I give this anime a 3 instead of a 1 or 2.
                              My background:
                              ""IsekaiHood, the Anime""
                              There are more number of isekai anime now a days. I heard many saying this is just another isekai. Guys now here this out ""THIS IS NOT ANOTHER ISEKAI ANIME"" , This is the best ever isekai (a.k.a GOD FATHER of isekai). I just read the manga which was ongoing at chapter 68, the story was so exciting so actually moved to read the light novel also finished it.... believe it or not, This anime has best story(saying form novel reader).
                              Reincarnated to have another chance... at being a disgusting person.
                              Before I start this review, I really don't want to talk about the greats of this series as most other reviews will be addressing already, so if you want to know about why you SHOULD watch this series, read another review. Instead, I will be addressing (and debunking) some of the reasons other people will tell you to not watch this show.
                              What can I say, it checks all the boxes for a fantasy anime and an isekai. 
                              To start this review i'm just going to be outright. I love this series. I first started reading the LN and WN around a year ago due to general boredom and i must say it was a rather good decision. The anime adaptation is everything i'd thought it would be and more."

                              It's becoming more apparent to me by each passing season that if an anime gets any sort of recognition like this, it's bound to divide the community into 2 groups. The majority goes on to ride the hype train and hype the series in question up to the high heavens, while the other hops onto the hate train and then the shit-fest begins. I usually see myself not siding with any of these but frankly, the latter seems more reasonable to me than it ever was. I'll try to offer an unbiased opinion on this even though seeing its rating is kinda baffling. So let's          
                              [Disclaimer: The arguments I've made for story structure and such I'd probably still stand by. However, events of the plot I didn't judge necessary to address when I first wrote this review I can't say if I'd defend now. I made the choice to let the review as it stands and make no further edits.]
                              With any established community there are traditions that take fruition from within it. And when it comes to the anime community that tradition can be seen with the ritualistic assignment of labels that is accompanied with every new seasonal lineup. Each season's catalog is cherry-picked through by the ascending masses to be filed away in neat little categories that're decided by whatever the common consensus is at that time. And it's thanks to this unspoken system that we get our ""anime of the season,"" ""hidden gems"" and ""BURN WITH FIRE"" shows that, for the most part, seems to be what the general audience agree upon.          
                              So I've just finished this anime and if you're wondering if it's worth watching, I will tell you it truly is. A great masterpiece that keep me wanting more. The characters aren't too overwhelming or annoying and the pacing is nice. The story line is great also. 
                              Ever felt like you made a big mistake in life and wanted to fix it? Or perhaps you just want things to go in the right direction if given another chance? Most people will never get that sort of opportunity. But for a guy named Satoru Fujinuma, that’s another story. His ability, Revival is pretty much a gift that allows him to travel back in time with his memories. So in essence, the guy can basically fix mistakes in his life with a second opportunity. Actually, I should probably rephrase that. What he has isn’t just a gift but also a responsibility. The ability to          
                              Well, I've almost watched all anime masterpieces and undoubtedly, this is one of them. I've never written a review before, but now I do, because this anime really earned it.

                              Ambition is the elixir of creation. It is that which gives spirit to its container, and those rare gems that rise above their standardized, rehashed counterparts are almost always backed by the unadulterated ambition of their creator(s). And ambition rests on the shoulders of ideas. The notion of ideas and ambition being interlocked is an unspoken truth - a virtuous tenet of great works. However, there is something more; something that too often gets overlooked, and when untended, sets both ambition and the idea that bore it on route for inevitable disaster. That ‘something’ is focus. An idea – no matter how great or innovative          
                              Boku dake ga Inai Machi (ERASED) is an anime that capitalizes on emotional appeal. It incorporates plot devices that primarily targets the audience’s pathos and on a surface level achieves this very effectively. Unfortunately, these same plot devices are only contrived for the sole purpose of making the audience have the so-called “feels.” From a more logical perspective, they do not make any sense, and because of this, we are left with an inconsistent plotline that is riddled with flaws.
                              It was a cold, uncompromising winter in the early weeks of 2016 but thankfully a new anime had heralded its arrival with a promise warm the world’s hearts. People braved the blizzard of mediocrity to find that one show that could rise to the top and be the ray of sunshine they craved. Boku dake ga Inai Machi (Or known by its English title ‘Erased’) waved its hand high and proud, promising a touching tale of one man’s journey to fix both the past and the present. The show did indeed have a certain glow about it that appealed to me but it’s sad to          
                              Hype can be a fickle thing when it comes to seasonal anime. At first it allows fans to get excited and anxious for the next episode, but majority of the time it ends up with many feeling somewhat disappointed with what they had been watching. This can be attributed to the fact that only one episode is released per week, and this week-long wait between episodes is a breeding ground for die-hard fans to praise a show as one of the best anime after only having seen a couple episodes. You only have to see the ‘Top Anime List’ on MAL to see that whenever

"While playing in the snow one day at her shrine, the land god Nanami Momozono witnesses her familiar—the fox youkai Tomoe—collapse, with dark markings appearing on his body. Tomoe's former master, Lord Mikage, appears after his long absence and places Tomoe into a magical pocket mirror in order to stave off his ailment.

Mikage explains that long ago, before he and Tomoe had met, the fox youkai was in love with a human woman. Seeking to live as a human with his beloved, he made a deal with a fallen god, but he only ended up cursed and dying. When Mikage discovered Tomoe, the god made the youkai forget his human love as a quick solution. However, something has changed recently to reactivate the curse; Tomoe has fallen in love with his new human master, Nanami. Since there is no way to stop the curse, Nanami wants to stop Tomoe from getting cursed in the first place by traveling back through time, even if it means they may never meet. As Nanami travels back hundreds of years to save her precious familiar, she discovers that she is far more closely bonded to Tomoe than she previously thought.

                              It was so good I actually cried.  (Rarely cries when watching tv shows or movies)
                              I fell deeply in love with all the episodes of Kamisama Hajimemashita from Season 1 to 2 to its OVA version. I love the development of the two main characters; from enemies to friends, and eventually, to lovers. Unlike, the many animes that I have seen, the streak of independence, wit, kind-heartedness, positivity, and charm in Nanami was a welcome change from the dimwitted and damsel-in-distress qualities that female leads in this genre have been stereotyped with. Same with Tomoe, who, though initially had difficulty wearing his heart on his sleeve, still managed to overcome the usual cold and steely demeanor, which often characterized anime          
                              First things first, don't expect to feel ""satisfied"" with the ending after watching this. Reading the manga is so much better in terms of furthering the plot with Nanami, Tomoe, and Akura-ou. 
                              I'm going to assume you've watched season 1 and 2 before reading this.
                              Before I start, this is my first review, so it might suck. Also, I've read the manga volumes that this four part OVA covers, so take that how you want to. 
                              Ok, i know the anime hasn't finished yet, but i have read the manga so i know how much i love it already and if you have an issue with this review just go to the next one. It is hard to talk about it without giving anything away, but ill do my best!
                              I'm a big fan of this anime series, and have read the manga, so I know what happens throughout these four episodes. On one hand I'm happy to be able to continue this series, but on the other I'm not sure how this will span out considering in the manga it is the part of this series that is the most romance filled , and so spreading it through only 4 half an hour episodes may feel rushed. Hopefully not.
                              Well first of all, all i can say about this anime is AWESOME OMG!! LOVE IT SOO MUCH!!"

                              Note: This is a remake of the classic Battle Ship Yamato by Leiji Matsumoto which is one of the most revolutionary anime.
                               	To be called “The Star Wars of Japan” you must be doing something oh so right.  “Space Battleship Yamato (1974- 1975) was labeled as such. It’s a show so imbedded in popular culture that I had even heard of it. This was long before even watching my very first anime (To me known as “Star Blazers” for US).  It was truly the show of an age. Now fast forward to April, 7th, 2012, an OVA remake of the beloved classic begins its air time.  The final question of fans was. Will it live up to the original?  Or disappoint us          
                              Remakes or reboots often get a bad rap in the anime community as many beloved series often get messed up and butchered in an attempt to add a more modern spin on an already old and classic series. Space Battleship Yamato 2199, however, is a remake of the classic series that is not only able to catch the spirit of the original, but is able to expand further and vastly improve and succeed on what the 1974 version couldn’t do in terms of production values. This OVA remake has become the pinnacle of what a modern space opera should be, and I’ll explain why this          
                              THIS COULD BE AN EPIC ANIME... but it falls short. Therefore only 7/10. You will enjoy it at first and then you will get disappointed, wishing it could be perfect. I hate anime like that. 
                              About two years ago, I watched through the original Star Blazers/Yamato series, as well as the sequel and inter-quel movies that accompanied them. While they each had significant flaws (under-developed characters, lack of world building, and short-changed arcs in the case of season 3), I enjoyed following the adventures of the Space Battleship Yamato from series to series thanks to its well-animated fight scenes for the time, thought-provoking (if heavy-handed), exploration of moral grey areas, and the inspirational message that no matter what happens, good will triumph over evil.
                              A journey; a trek; a voyage, that's how watching Uchuu Senkan Yamato 2199 feels like.
                              So at the time of writing this review i have seen this artwork twice. The first time was in 2013. Second time at the end of 2017, just a day before 2018.
                              I have not seen the original Yamato, so this review has not ""old-new"" hate or nostalgia. It's about Yamato 2199 as a singular anime series.
                              Considering the very high rating, I'm a bit disappointed. Sad to say, because it certainly had potential to be better.
                              Wow!  This show absolutely blew me away!  I haven't enjoyed a series so much in a long time.  I've been going through movies and shows, from all sorts of genres and eras and styles, and rarely does anything have everything I want to see in an anime, and this is one of those!  I'll admit, I put off looking into any of the Space Battleship Yamato series or movies simply because the surface concept seemed so outrageous - a World War 2 style battleship...IN SPACE?  That's CRAZY!  I could not have been more wrong.
                              For those that wonder about this anime, you might not partially like space-related anime. But I warn you, give this anime an chance. I wasn't too keen on watching this show but I gave it an chance. And guess what? I was surprised that I actually liked it.
                              I was originally going to rate this a 7, because while I enjoyed it, I didn't think the story was all that remarkable - heroes go out into space, defeat the universe, and save the planet - you've seen it all before right? But then I considered how much I like the characters, and the little things that must have been thought about to make everything flow; there was nothing in the series that dragged on or rushed through, or that didn't somehow contribute to the plot or the characters, and it results in a very wholesome feeling anime.
                              It is so difficult to rate. It's quite enjoyable but also has so many irritating faults. Not to mention that it's rated really high and by that was a total letdown.
                              Three days ago I had no idea what Space Battleship Yamato 2199 was; I had no idea about the original series made back in the 1970s; I had no idea of the cultural significance it has in Japan, on par with Star Wars in the West; but I have corrected my woeful ignorance and it was one of the best decisions I've made."

                              If you watched season 1 and season 2 and the movie, it's just another adventure with these girls in their daily and we freaking love it. It's just more sunshine and joy we need in times like these. There's nothing speculator about it, it's just cuteness and smiles as we watch them on their whacky adventure and make belief as they find joy in the simple things. The innocent days of being a kid. 
                              When I heard that Non non was coming out with another series/season, I just had to start watching it's previous seasons and movie, and I'm so happy that I did such. Because it's not only worth a watch, super enjoyable, but it got me ready for even more when it comes to Non non Biyori Nonstop. Because it leaves off where it last was. In terms of presentation, story, and it's lovely bunch of cast."

                              For those reading this review w/o finishing the first season will be spoiled so be forewarned
                              Continuing a beloved series and making it greater or just as great can be a challenging task to take. This is not much of a problem for anime that are step-by-step adaptations of any type of original source medium. Spice and Wolf, if you don’t know, is one series that won me over from the previous season. Likewise, I was hoping that this 2nd season would have the same positive impact that the 1st season did for me. While it is not better than the first season in many aspects, it definitely possessed the same fascinating qualities that the 1st season had, with a few          
                                 First of all, I must say this is my 1 review, so I lack of experience, and my English is not the best, but here are my appointments.
                              *This is a non-spoiler review of both seasons of Spice and Wolf
                              Vulnerability is the essence of romance. It's the art of being uncalculated, the willingness to look foolish, the courage to say, 'This is me, and I'm interested in you enough to show you my flaws with the hope that you may embrace me for all that I am but, more important, all that I am not.'
                              (This has been adapted from my reddit thread)
                              Of Spice and Wolf season 2 is a disappointment in almost every sense of the word. It is slightly worse in every aspect than the first season, and the first season wasn’t even that good. 
                              After an epic final in the first season which left me stunned. I was expecting the second season to slow down and turn more romantic. Found out i am right, but the mercantile stuff is still going strong and there is even a merchant duel on par with death note quality. Backstabbing and market values etc. It all returns in its great glory!
                              I just need to preface this review with the fact that I have an intense love in my heart for analytical, deep thinking and outside of the box ""anything"". I had such, such high hopes for this show. I mean, I poured through the reviews, and I was so freaking PUMPED. I was that kid who was obsessed with games on building, trading...empires...history... By the end of the 2nd season I was just F***** PISSED. The first season was sheer dent of will...this was a crucibal. 
                              Compared to the first season i was very disappointed. I was hoping for a second season that flowed the same as the first season and it simply did not. I wont go into too much detail but literally half of the season they are in one town, just one town! And just trying to make one deal! 
                              This is the first review I have ever written on anime, however, that is only testament to the fact that I have never been so moved by one. Spice and Wolf's greatness stems from the fact that they do not pander to the lowest common denominator. Spice and Wolf does not intend to be an extremely popular anime, what it intends to, and succeeds in doing is being the very best anime for a niche audience. 
                              Well, im simply saying this to strengthen my next sentence, but i have watched nearly 500 anime series... And this is by far the best romance anime among them and one of the best among all genres. Even though the Light Novels ended and even fully translated by now, they should animate all of Light Novels,not for the profit from it or to advertise Light Novels, but to leave an example of pinnacle for all japanese animation made from Light Novels and the pinnacle for Light Novels alike. It would not be far fetched to say that this is the pinnacle of them all, by          
                              Fuck that beautiful just beautiful end, this anime pretty surprised me ah never thought an anime of 2009 in terms of Animation, ambience and soundtrack far exceed Anime Anime 2014 This was just a masterpiece with very uan style ambience of the time where cities bestimentas funds occurs, all very style of the time, the plot is just very well thought makes me think the phrase ""are pure business"" and again, the characters are also maravollosos (protruding Horo) the more secondary side may have a past or a story that makes you get more desire to know (A what Space Dandy), the animation is exemplary          
                              Everything that was wonderful about the first season continues on during this second part of the Spice and Wolf saga."
"Introverted classical pianist and top student Kaoru Nishimi has just arrived in Kyushu for his first year of high school. Having constantly moved from place to place since his childhood, he abandons all hope of fitting in, preparing himself for another lonely, meaningless year. That is, until he encounters the notorious delinquent Sentarou Kawabuchi.

Sentarou's immeasurable love for jazz music inspires Kaoru to learn more about the genre, and as a result, he slowly starts to break out of his shell, making his very first friend. Kaoru begins playing the piano at after-school jazz sessions, located in the basement of fellow student Ritsuko Mukae's family-owned record shop. As he discovers the immense joy of using his musical talents to bring enjoyment to himself and others, Kaoru's summer might just crescendo into one that he will remember forever.

Sakamichi no Apollon is a heartwarming story of friendship, music, and love that follows three unique individuals brought together by their mutual appreciation for jazz.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.36,8,176,497,286856,5941,"                              I love jazz. Some of my favorite memories of my time living in Florida have to be going downtown to listen to the local jazz festival. Sitting in front of that gazebo and getting into the spirit of the musicians is something you can only experience if you listen to jazz. It’s so different from any other musical genre and I was excited as hell to get to watch an anime centered around this amazing style of music.
                              First of all, I must say it's been a while since I've enjoyed a series as much as I enjoyed Sakamichi no Apollon.
                              Treasure your Friends, Unlike Love Affairs, Friendship is for Life.
                              Sakamichi no Apollon is a school drama from 2012. The original manga was written by Kodama Yuki. The anime version was brought to us by MAPPA & Tezuka, neither of which I've seen a lot from. I don't know what to expect from this one at all. So, let's just get right into it. 
                              As someone who hasn't good much background on both Jazz music and Japan during the 1960s, I was wary of watching it at first.
                              Do you like jazz? Would you like to see a show where jazz is the focus? Where the characters have fun playing some good ol' jazz pieces with each other and talking about jazz pieces? Then this anime is NOT for you. Do you like normal cliché romance with poorly constructed drama with a far too fast and disappointing ending? Then this anime is for you!
                              Are you ready for a bromance so strong, you’ll feel friendship tingles down the shaft of your peen? For romance elements so complex, they are no longer love triangles--but instead, terrifying, ever-growing love polygons of doom? For jam sessions so boppin’ they could make the late, great, Sun Ra tap his foot in his grave? Then my friend, you are prepared for Kids on the Slope.
                              The story consists of a lot of romance tropes, and really tends to play up it's character drama. I didn't enjoy the romance stuff very much, but I feel like the show worked remarkably well in portraying the tension of the relationship between characters through music. When the characters are playing music together, you really can feel their emotions come through, and I thought that was really impressive. The characters, and their interactions with each other were really the best part of the story, despite the otherwise pretty boilerplate storyline.
                              This was an anime that popped up in my recommendations for a while based off various other's I watched.  I simply didn't believe it would be anything close to what I wanted and became frustrated seeing the same cover page over and over of which I wasn't to fond of.  I refused to watch it time and time again based on my own superficial reasons until I finally said to myself ""it's 20 minutes of my life, I'll watch just one episode.""  It wasn't just 20 minutes, it ended up being a good portion of the season before I had to finally          
                              This is my first time writing a review here and I tried my hardest to leave out any real spoilers. So, here we go:
                              Once again we are encountering a great anime. Kids on the slope is another combo between Shinichiro Watanabe and Yoko Kanno. I can't imagine now if someone else did a screen version of Kids on the slope. But lets get to the point.
                              It’s not gay if it’s a three way.  
                              How much you enjoy Sakamichi no Apollon is largely dependent on your level of emotional maturity.
                              Set in 1966, Sakamichi no Apollon is centered on Kaoru Nishimi as he moves to Sasebo to live with relatives due to his father’s job. Naturally, he’s a loner, a great student, and completely isolated from people since he’s always been moving around; he doesn't try to get attached to people in case he must leave them again. But there’s something in the air in Sasebo, and it’s not just love or friendship, it’s a new sound (to Japan at least) known as jazz. Music isn't new to Kaoru as he’s a classically trained pianist, but jazz is certainly new and interesting to him, as          
                              When anime fans see the name Shinichiro Watanabe attached to an anime they usually get excited due to his excellent work making Cowboy Bebop. So going into Sakamichi no Apollon there is a certain expectation given to the show. Unlike Watanabe's previous animes, this one does not have any action in it at all. Instead, the focus is on romance and drama."
"Koyomi Araragi, a third-year high school student, manages to survive a vampire attack with the help of Meme Oshino, a strange man residing in an abandoned building.

Regardless, Araragi tries to live the life of a normal student, with the help of his friend and the class president, Tsubasa Hanekawa.

When fellow classmate Hitagi Senjougahara falls down the stairs and is caught by Araragi, the boy realizes that the girl is unnaturally weightless. Despite Senjougahara's protests, Araragi insists he help her, deciding to enlist the aid of Oshino, the very man who had once helped him with his own predicament.

Through several tales involving demons and gods, Bakemonogatari follows Araragi as he attempts to help those who suffer from supernatural maladies.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.36,8,177,62,1072823,41532,"                              For every medium, there are few masterpieces that transcend the genre and become something special.  Since I consider anime, as a genre, to be just as legitimate an art form (despite the bad rep it often gets), I will also review Bakemonogatari as a work of art, and it is irrefutably one of the special few anime series that fully capitalize on the strengths of the anime medium.
                              THIS REVIEW IS FOR ALL SEASONS, AS SUCH, IT CONTAINS SPOILERS
                              ""Did you know every time you sigh, a little bit of happiness escapes?"" - Senjougahara Hitagi, Episode 6
                              This anime seemed to have a lot of mysteries in it, but the biggest mystery it presented to me was why I took such a violent dislike to it even though it has been favorably discussed by intelligent viewers. I stopped watching it early on, out of simple irritation. To me it was marching straight down that wrong road we are warned against in the aphorism, ""Don't gild the lily."" 
                              **SPOILER FREE REVIEW**
                              It is very rare to see such a successful marriage of a director’s vision and an author’s material. Bakemonogatari’s existence is an anomaly especially in present day where adaptations are subpar when compared to the source. However, there has never been a more potent combination than Nisio Isin and Studio SHAFT’s Akiyuki Shinbou. Shinbou’s quirky, and imaginative art direction greatly compliments the fast paced dialogue and witticisms that Nisio is known for. The end result is a tour de force of both visuals and prose. Bakemonogatari is a meticulously crafted tale that never ceases to maintain the viewer’s attention and titillate the imagination.
                              Author's note: Please don't take this review too seriously. This is merely describing my own painful experience with this show. I'm not personally attacking Monogatari fans! Thank you.
                              Finally giving in to the hype, I picked up Bakemonogatari, the most discussed anime of '09, on the very first day of this year. The show's appeal was lost on me during the first few episodes, but after a while the reasons for this anime's charm on so many became apparent. As to whether that charm worked on me as well, that's something I'm going to explain a bit more thoroughly further on.
                              Some people says that Bakemonogatari is a milestone in the anime history. That's correct, because before the appearance of this one, the anime industry doesn't know what the ultimate shit is. And now it knows, all of us knows right now. The standard of ugliness, standard of boredom, standard of tastelessness, standard of potboiler, national team of all shounen's cliches, the lowest mark on the scale of the quality from now on has a material incarnation - Bakemonogatari. So it's, no doubt, a great milestone in anime history.

                              ENGLISH IS NOT MY FIRST LANGUAGE, SORRY IF I WRITE SOMETHING WRONG
                              'People save themselves on their own. Nobody can ever save anyone else'
                              For starters, this is more of an analysis than a review and is intended for those who have already seen Bakemonogatari.
                              Filled with gorgeous shots of underaged women, inventive fourth-wall breaks, and highly detailed PowerPoint slides, Bakemonogatari single-handedly redefined what it meant to be a pretentious anime at the time of its release in a way that no anime since has been able to capture the essence of. It is an incredible feat that a harem anime manages to get across so little humor and emotion with so much ostensible effort. Perhaps if I was steeped in Japanese culture, I would understand that the tsundere girl talking to the viewer about being tsundere was actually a post-ironic meta-commentary reference about the overabundance of meaningless fourth wall

"In an Edo-era Japan lush with a variety of sword-fighting styles, Shichika Yasuri practices the most unique one: Kyotouryuu, a technique in which the user's own body is wielded as a blade. The enigmatic seventh head of the Kyotouryuu school, Shichika lives quietly in exile with his sister Nanami until one day—the wildly ambitious strategist Togame barges into their lives.

Togame brazenly requests that Shichika help in her mission to collect twelve unique swords, known as the ""Deviant Blades,"" for the shogunate. Shichika accepts, interested in the girl herself rather than petty politics, and thus sets out on a journey. Standing in their way are the fierce wielders of these legendary weapons as well as other power-hungry entities who seek to thwart Togame's objective. In order to prevail against their enemies, the duo must become an unbreakable team as they forge ahead on a path of uncertainty and peril.

                              I simply cannot grasp why this anime receives so much praise.
                              What do you fight for?  That is a question with no simple answer. People say that they wish to accomplish some sort of dream or aspiration. To achieve fame, fortune, love, or maybe even revenge.  Some are simple and others ambitious beyond belief.  The real question is, do you have the will to fulfill that dream?  Is it truly what you wish for? Are willing to struggle to the end for it? Many people try to fulfill their aspirations. Many people simply die in regret and are forgotten.  Others fulfill a dream so large they are remembered for all time.          
                              Katanagatari is interesting because it's one of the better anime in recent time (that I have seen), one of the best anime from 2010 (that I have seen) and arguably the best work of NisiOisiN (that I have seen, even though this only includes two titles).
                              What is it that you fight for? Money? Power? Honor? Love? Revenge? Out of all the millions of reasons , in the end does it really matter? These are some of the things you will ponder while watching Katanagatari. Nisio Isin, the mind behind the monogatari-series, which some might call a twist on the harem genre, has used his deft hand at creating unique characters and worlds, in what would traditionally be a shounen premise. The end result, is a masterfully crafted tale that blends Japanese folklore, romance, and martial arts with a very contemporary touch that makes Katanagatari feel both modern and old at          
                              Katanagatari started as a light novel series by Isin Nisio. Who's written nothing else that I'm familiar with. He wrote some novelizations for both Death Note and xxxHolic, but I'm only familiar with the originals for those two and novels based on established series tend to vary a lot in quality. The anime adaptation was handled by the relatively new White Fox studio. They were behind both the Jormungand and Steins;Gate anime, so that could be a good sign. Then again, every studio tends to do some good and some bad work so this could be the first anime they've done that I dislike. Only          
                              Considering the amount of love this show has received, it feels risky giving a comparatively low score to Katanagatari, although I don't personally consider a 7 by any means low. Please don't label this review as ""not helpful"" just because you disagree with the scores or think they are too low. This is a difficult show to review because a) most of my complaints are directed to the plot and character development, both of which are difficult to describe without spoilers, and b) some of the complaints can also be considered reasons why this show is amazing or unique. Unique is indeed one of the          
                              **SPOILER FREE REVIEW**
                              I'm actually astounded by the huge number of people lauding Katanagatari as a masterpiece, with high rating of 9's and 10's popping off everywhere in the reviews, claiming that it is perfect/flawless blah blah blah,  listing everything positive about it then exaggerating it further. This makes it appear like it's 10/10 worthy solely from reviews when really, it's far from the truth. While Katanagatari isn't the worst out there which feels mentally violating or makes you want to smack your head against a brick wall or a sharp corner on your table, it is not on the same level as the masterpieces, which feels

                              Katanagatari: a tale of twelve twisted swords,
                              Katanagatari is an anime that I came to surprise, not to discredit, but the other animated works of Mr. Nisio Isin have seemed very mediocre, under this prejudiced thinking, I present myself before Katanagatari
                              You could pretty much summarize the whole plot of Katanagatari (sword story in English) by it's title. Because, it really is story about two people traveling around japan, collecting twelve magical swords. However, when you actually sit down and watch it, you will probably get more out of it than you had expected.

                              It would not be to much of a stretch to call this an Chinese attempt at a Studio Ghibli style animated story. All the little notes that one attributes to Ghibli are there. The vague, yet familiar story; the grandiose reveals of scenery; relatable yet other worldly characters; and a musical score that's both supportive of the art and at the same time having an immense presence of its own."

                              Prologue:
                              Kemono no Souja Erin: Destruction of Boundaries
                              While it may strike as inconsistent to rate a series a 3 when I ""finished"" 50 episodes of it, there is one essential reason, that is pacing of this series. Not only is the pacing typically slice-of-life slow from the very start, but it has the most self-indulgent use of flashback I have ever seen. By the midpoint of the anime, flashback starts taking up easily perhaps 1/10th of the total time. We already saw these events, and they are already in our heads. Bringing the same events up as much as five or ten times is a horrible abuse of our viewership. Maybe it          
                              Yep...the time has come. I've been gradually watching this series for about 3 months and now it's finally time to give my thoughts on it. This isn't going to be easy. On the one hand, I really love this series. I added it to my extended favorites without hesitation. The first 20 episodes are absolutely amazing! It's still the best anime adaptation of a YA novel that I've seen. I think it's quite a bit better than Moribito or Shinsekai Yori.
                              Nahoko Uehashi’s Kemono no Souja Erin is a “hidden gem” anime. While more people have seen/heard of Uehashi’s Seirei no Moribito, not nearly enough people have seen this beautiful series. I could babble about how much I love this series for hours, but, instead, I’ll try to tell you why (and why it’s 9/10 instead of 10/10!).
                              Kemono no Souja Erin is a good choice for you if you want to watch a series aimed for children that tries to build a fantasy world that has its own depth and use that to ingrain something into your moral fiber. However this immediately becomes a terrible choice if you can't handle its slow pace and its very poor choices in the sound department, which I'll get on later. And it's also an obviously terrible choice if you don't expect it to treat you like a dumb kid who needs flashbacks every few episodes to be remembered what happens and don't like being to          
                              ""Kemono no Souja Erin"" is an anime with great plot potential, well build characters and pleasant design, but unfortunately - horrid storytelling and structure. It takes 50 episodes to tell the story (which is supposed to be understandable, since it's long one), but dragged scenes with badly animated conversations, and lots of flashbacks make you feel as if it should be done in 26 episodes instead - and maybe it should have. 
                              Fantasy anime have long been characterized by an abundance of wicked sorcerers and cute cat girls, but Kemono no Souja Erin features none of these tropes, instead drawing on elements from classic fairy tales. Its innocuous artstyle, which mimics the illustrations of Aesop’s picture books, exhibits an aura foreign to most contemporary anime fans. Coupled with its unremarkable first episode, the show is easy to dismiss as a childish folktale not worth the trouble.
                              The first word that comes to mind after watching Kemono no Souja Erin is LIFE.  It is a story of a young girl growing up and finding her own pathway, as her mother asked her to do, to live and find happiness.  It has a series of ups, downs and everywhere in between.
                              I'm sure that most of you have heard of anime such as Naruto, Bleach, and Sword Art Online, but haven't heard of Beast Player Erin. Truly a shame which anime are becoming popular and which are becoming overlooked and forgotten these days. Beast Player Erin is a series that isn't nearly as popular as other modern shows, but it's one that once you know about it, you're going to want to watch it, then you're going to love it, then wish you had known about it before and then be overwhelmed by the urge to re-watch it; this was certainly the case for me. I've

The series is so different from all the other Gundams, and so successful at what it does that it appears to be more similar to 'Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex' and 'Legend of the Galactic Heroes' than it is similar to other Gundams.
                              Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin/機動戦士ガンダムTHE ORIGIN Review
                              PSA: This is a prequel; please watch AFTER you watch the original series
                              Like everyone else on MAL, I also enjoyed Gundam: The Origin. The CG looks great. The action set pieces are amazing. It's a series made by Gundam fans, for Gundam fans. In other words, this is fanservice done right. At the same time, I do feel it's become a tad overrated. A lot people are calling this the best Gundam series and it's really not. I might not receive many helpfuls for doing this, but I feel like I HAVE to say some of this or else I'll go insane.
                              Gundam Origin to me is close to being a perfect prequel. Before someone gets up in their arms about Origin technically coming from a manga that’s a full on retelling of the MGS 0079 story and therefore being more of a spin-off than a prequel, I think they decided to cut it off before the events of the TV show because that’s where some more noticeable deviations start. However prior to that it roots itself strongly in the material people already know with only minor deviations that in my opinion don’t undermine what it adds to the universe.
                              Before I get to the review, I'll have you know that I have not yet read the manga yet. I may have read it, but not when I wrote this review. 
                              Alright! This series was my introduction to Gundam, as recommended by many people. Before watching this I had no view or idea of what Gundam was and what was in store for me. I am happy to say I am overjoyed after watching this. The animation and everything was amazing and very enjoyable. I can say after viewing this OVA I am now a fan of Gundam. I am very impressed with the OVA's ability to capture the viewer, and make me go,"" Whoa!"" I found myself quickly becoming attached to the cast and caring about what happens next and what is planned to happen.          
                              You know, this franchise really likes to retell the story of the OYW. I’m serious, there are so many reimaginings, retellings and side stories that it’s ridiculous. Perhaps the most infamous one is Tomino’s MSG Novel Trilogy, which I’ll get around to reading at some point. The most famous for good reasons, however, has to be Gundam The Origin. A 24 Volume Manga by Yasuhiko Yoshikazu the retells the whole original series while adding a shit load of new content to it. While I have been planning to read it, lack of accessibility has prevented me from doing so; however I will read it as          
                              Welcome to my third review. After the first 2 I am finally giving a review to something outstanding. This review is about the ONA 'Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin'.
                              SS Review – Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin
                              Really shows the limitations of directly adapting a manga series, having all the best and worst moments thrown in together with no regard as to how it's going to play out in a new medium. Someday Japanese anime companies are going to realize that 100% faithfully adapting a comic into TV format doesn't actually always work, because one medium has sound and motion while the other has panel spacing and static imagery. Really, there were so many moments in these six Gundam: The Origin movies where they could have messed around with the pacing, or ignored the narration in favor of visual storytelling, or just          
                              [Edit] The only other Gundam that I gave the highest score was Iron-Blooded Orphans. Now I must give to Gundam: The Origin, too. As a Gundam fan, I watch everything Gundam-related, but few get the highest score. This is an outstanding OVA series, with an amazing story. I`ll tell you all about bellow, but I already warn you that you must be familiar with the Universal Century from Gundam, to get the full experience.
                              The Universal Century Gundam timeline has always had an air of Game of Thrones in space (or more accurately the other way around, since Tomino was doing this decades before Martin). Nowhere is this more clearly felt than in Gundam: The Origin. By setting the bulk of the story in a time of relative peace, we see the political machinations, plotting, and betrayals come to the fore. It's riveting stuff, sprawling across an interplanetary stage. While Casval/Edouard/Char/Quattro (seriously, how many names does this guy have?) is the main focus, plenty of time is spent fleshing out many other familiar faces from the One Year War.          
                              An amazing work of art, I want Gundam 0079 and Zeta Gundam rebooted in this style, with this quality, oh how I want the entire Gundam Origins manga brought into life like this.
                              Before I truly start with this review I must say that Char Aznable is one of my favorite characters in all of fiction and  before I watched the last two episodes, I was ready to tear this show to shreds because of it’s awful portrait of the Char Aznable character, fortunately the last two episodes were so good that the show went from a 4 to a 7.

"Toua Tokuchi is an athlete by profession, but a reckless gambler at heart. On the streets of Okinawa, he uses nothing but his wits and a ""fastball"" peaking at a mere 134 kmph to somehow achieve 499 wins in the game of ""One Outs,"" a simplified version of baseball between the pitcher and one batter. Amazed by Toua's unique prowess on the mound, veteran slugger Hiromichi Kojima artfully scouts the pitcher for his long unsuccessful team, the Saikyou Saitama Lycaons. Kojima desperately hopes Toua will lead them to the championship; however, Tsuneo Saikawa, the mercenary owner of the Lycaons, sees the vastly talented pitcher as a threat to the income generated by the team. Rising to the challenge of swaying the owner, Toua suggests a one-of-a-kind ""One Outs"" contract: every out Toua pitches will earn him five million yen, but with every run he gives up, he will lose fifty million yen.

Adapted from the manga by Shinobu Kaitani of Liar Game fame, One Outs documents the intense psychological battles between Toua and those around him. With millions of yen at stake, can a pitcher who has done nothing but gamble in a head-to-head imitation of baseball finally lead a real baseball team to victory?

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.35,8,185,821,184042,3414,"                              So, One Outs is an anime about sports, right? Hell no! Its about Tokuchi owning everyone and kicking their asses! Its very similar to Akagi, so if you enjoyed that the chances are VERY slim that you wont enjoy this one as well!
                              ""Winner takes all. This is the universal rule of battle."" - Toua Tokuchi. 
                              Pen is mightier than sword, that is what we learn from one outs. From the synopsis one may be confused that Is this baseball? Is this chess? Is this gambling? The answer is Nope its not, its ONE OUTS. Bored of animes with cliche MC, who either suck at everything and gradually develops into a strong character or suddenly gets a powerboost to defeat all his foes, or in the name of friends brings out some kind of hidden power, and stuff, then u r definitely looking for this awesomesauce.
                              Shit.
                              One Outs was a baseball manga written by Kaitani Shinobu. It was adapted into an anime by our old friends at Madhouse, who brought us such classics as Black Lagoon, Petshop of Horrors and Rideback. Unfortunately, they've also been behind some of the worst anime I've ever seen such as Highschool of the Dead and Devil Hunter Yohko. I'm honestly not predicting their best work this time around, although a lot of that is more to do with the subject matter than anything else. I am not a person who cares about sports in the slightest. So, let's look at One Outs and see if          
                              It can be difficult to find a good mind game anime that doesn’t water down the suspense. One Outs is a classic example of this. The story follows our main character Toua Tokuchi who loves two things: baseball and gambling. He plays for a team and demonstrates his skills in both pitching and out thinking his opponents. The show has a darker theme given its more mature art style and character design similar to that of Akagi and Kaiji.
                              ""Winning a game is not dependent on surpassing your opponents with your strength or waiting for lucky breaks. Conquer the opponent, crushing them, and stepping over the fallen ones ruthlessly. Winning means dominating over countless dead bodies.""
                              This anime was partially enjoyable, but my enjoyment was mostly overshadowed by what I see as failed potential. One Outs starts out with a world of potential with the interesting and enigmatic main character, genius pitcher Tokuchi Toua. The supporting characters are interesting as well and immediately given impressive backstory and development. The atmosphere seemed to be setting up for a great baseball journey and even the narrator promised that great unforeseen events would happen later on. However, after the first few introductory episodes the series levels out and becomes uninteresting focusing on one long match after another. Many people say this series is like          
                              Hands down my favorite anime.  I've rewatched it twice and if it were possible to erase my memories of what happens in this anime, I would likely rewatch it many more times.  Now, without further ado...
                              ""A low possibility doesn't mean its zero"" 
                              “Winning is about trampling over corpses… It's not something beautiful. It's brutal. If you want to make it to the top- Steel yourselves.”
                              this isn't really a sports anime, despite using baseball as a vehicle, and it isn't really a gambling show either, despite the lead character Tokuchi being an inveterate gambler.  it is primarily a sort of mystery -- i got the most out of trying to figure out what Tokuchi was thinking, and how he would foil his enemies.
                              *Note* This is my first review, so any feedback on how I can make it better/more useful to the reader is greatly appreciated :), thanks in advance.
                              Who said gamble mixed with sport isn't good enough? Well, those who have opinion like that should consider to watch One Outs. As the synopsis above, One outs is mostly about gambling in baseball world. Yes, gamble and baseball. Although, the gamble in this term isn't about manipulating score or something like that, it's more one on one gamble, in this term it's Touma vs the club owner.
                              One Outs was an overall enjoyable series that was definitely worth the watch. It contained an interesting and rather original premise, and captured my attention from the early episodes. However, it was not without it's flaws."

Unfortunately, Romeo becomes the interest of a man named Luini, known as ""The God of Death,"" who is infamous for buying children and selling them as chimney sweeps in Milan. While visiting the village, Luini burns down Romeo's family cornfield in an attempt to have Romeo as his own. With the cornfield gone and his father sustaining a head injury trying to put out the fire, Romeo bravely sells himself to the God of Death in order to help his family afford a doctor. 

On his way to Milan, Romeo meets a boy named Alfredo Martini and they quickly become friends. Just as Alfredo is sold to a different master, the two boys swear eternal friendship and vow to meet again. As a chimney sweep, Romeo faces many hardships and abuse, especially from his master's family and a gang known as the Wolf Pack. But after reuniting with Alfredo, the two form a fraternity of chimney sweeps called ""The Black Brothers,"" who will learn to fight against the Wolf Pack and help each other in times of need.

                              Romeo's Blue Skies is one of the shorter and more recent additions to the collection of World Masterpiece Theatre series produced and animated by Nippon Animation. Once again it is an adaption of a work of literature originating from Europe, this time based on the novel ""Die schwarzen Brüder"" written by Lisa Tetzner.
                              Romeo no Aoi Sota is my favorite anime television show of all time (not just my favorite anime of all time) and there’s no quick answer to that. The main reason why I tell people to watch the show is because of the relaxing and simplistic atmosphere that the show has, but while saying that I think that I don’t do justice to my relationship with this show and taking into in consideration that I’ve dedicated most of my latest days to write about my favorite shows and the one I hate the most, I’ve decided to write another essay explaining in detail why I          
                              Romeo no Aoi Sora is, without a doubt, one of the most genuinely heartfelt shows I've had the pleasure to watch.
                              Now I've finished arguably one of the most accessible and most popular (just behind Daddy Long Legs) World Masterpiece Theater anime yet! I remember seeing the first episode of this long ago, but that was when the fansub group working on the remasters was working on Nobody's Boy Remi and Treasure Island. Once they got to working on it, I jumped at the opportunity to watch it. I liked it immensely, and I still do, but things often tried preventing me from watching it, like school, bad downloads, etc. But after a long while, I finally got to finish it, and I am proud of          
                              If you ask me what is this anime about and why the name mentions skies, I tell you this.
                              ""We'll always be together, no matter how far apart.""
                              this anime is one of the first series that I have ever watched (that was like 13 years ago) and is undeniably the first to made me cry like a brat kid in a department store (wasn't lying tho haha bc Alfred huhuhu)
                              Ill start by saying this,i consider myself lucky, to be one of the few people who successfully unearthed this treasure. Am not overrating this anime it simply deserves this. Nowadays almost all animes are based on supernatural powers aka things that would never encounter us in real life. Its sad to say, but people prefer those animes over things like Romeo no Aoi Sora. People completely forgot about even strong powers..... such as love, faithfulness, trust, hope, following ones dreams ,friendship and determination. All these elements and much more are all expressed in this anime thats why its one of a kind. Forgot to mention          
                              One of the reasons because i watch anime is the diversity of the stories. Some can be dramatic, romantic, comedic, etc. But some of theme are just beautiful. In terms of story, characters, the lesson that teaches when you watch it. Romeo no aoi sora is one of those.
                              I'm watching anime for more than 20 years. I'm a bit picky, which means that I tend to choose certain genres, art styles, plots and all that. Yet, I often watch anime of a kind that would appeal to much younger myself. "
"In the town of Kamisu 66, 12-year-old Saki Watanabe has just awakened to her psychic powers and is relieved to rejoin her friends—the mischievous Satoru Asahina, the shy Mamoru Itou, the cheerful Maria Akizuki, and Shun Aonuma, a mysterious boy whom Saki admires—at Sage Academy, a special school for psychics. However, unease looms as Saki begins to question the fate of those unable to awaken to their powers, and the children begin to get involved with secretive matters such as the rumored Tainted Cats said to abduct children.

Shinsekai yori tells the unique coming-of-age story of Saki and her friends as they journey to grow into their roles in the supposed utopia. Accepting these roles, however, might not come easy when faced with the dark and shocking truths of society, and the impending havoc born from the new world.

Be it Psycho Pass, Ergo Proxy or Texhnolyze, the average viewer is likely to have seen these ""hi-tech"" interpretations of future societies. Enter Shinsekai Yori – a series where whose setting is uncannily quaint such that on first glance, it is hard to see it as a dystopia; but it is, and an exceptionally remarkable one indeed.
                              “We ultimately fear what spawns from within us.”
                              Shinsekai yori is truly a great series. I've been wanting to write this review for a long time but I decided to wait until the series finished to do so as to write an accurate and coherent review as possible. After 6 months and 25 wonderful episodes, here it is. I will do my best to keep this review spoiler free. 
                              In recent years, many series have found success by centering themselves upon flagrant fanservice and fast-paced action. Shinsekai Yori, however, is the antithesis of this trend. 
                              Shinsekai Yori or From The New World's most convincing moments occur within the first four episodes. The story, which follows a group of psychokinetic children in the year 3000 in a dystopic yet serene Japanese environment, seamlessly weaves plot device after plot device until the granddaddy of straight-forward storytelling literally walks up to the main cast. A beast is captured by our protagonist, Saki, and explains to them upon request, what has happened to Japan to change it so drastically in the last 1000 years. The world of Shinsekai Yori takes four well-crafted episodes to establish it's universe believably. What follows seems tangentially related to          
                              Fear, Loss, Hope and Betrayal. Desire, Strength, Lies, and Perfection. If only Shinsekai Yori could be described with just these few words. You rarely see an anime that blends the Story, Art, Sound, and the growth of Characters so fluently. Its not simple to achieve this level of artistry. As a result, it’s not a simple story to watch. Your constantly given questions till the very end. However this makes the anime incredibly enjoyable to watch. It feels as though your brought closer into the story because of it. This Dark masterpiece questions humanities desires, darkens the line that separates Children form Adults, and presents          
                              Shinsekai Yori, or From The New World, is a teen-oriented piece of dystopic speculative fiction, the latest addition in this new wave of teen fiction to which the success of Hunger Games has opened the doors.
                              There's often a point in one's life to acknowledge the possibility of another worldly phenomenon that is outside of our collective conscience from where we live in that is in contrast with our own ideals. This has always been a subject of discussion since Plato's ""Allegory of the Cave"" that chronicles how our limited understanding of the reality that we perceive may not be what it seems since we're so entrenched in our own ideological society. Many works of fiction have dabbled this subject matter numerous times with some succeeding and others failing. Unfortunately for Shinsekai Yori, it falls into the latter, but not entirely.
                              Shinsekai yori was something else...
                              What started off as an interesting piece on a dystopian style future fantasy world quickly squandered all the good sense it had at the outset and devolved into a moral confused and seemingly pointless story line. 
                              [4.0/10]
                              **SPOILER FREE REVEIW**
                              Everyday we wake up, preform our daily ritual, then go to sleep, and all the while the world around us seems so perfectly normal. We, as people, have evolved to accept the normalcy of everyday life. It is seeing how people really act when normalcy is torn away from them that many people find so intriguing. 
                              Shinsekai Yori (From the New World) is something of an eclectic anime series. It's based off a novel, which hands it very different premises compared to anime that are based off manga or games (and for that matter, original anime), which is pretty evident in its characters and story, following few of the bigger anime clichés.
                              Upon revisiting this anime exactly two months from when I last finished it, (03/31/13) I am reminded of things that I have missed and that is this."
"It all started in Kaminoyama High School, when five best friends—Aoi Miyamori, Ema Yasuhara, Midori Imai, Shizuka Sakaki, and Misa Toudou—discovered their collective love for all things anime and formed the animation club. After making their first amateur anime together and showcasing it at the culture festival, the group vow to pursue careers in the industry, aiming to one day work together and create their own mainstream show.

Two and a half years later, Aoi and Ema have managed to land jobs at the illustrious Musashino Animation production company. The others, however, are finding it difficult to get their dream jobs. Shizuka is feeling the weight of not being recognized as a capable voice actor, Misa has a secure yet unsatisfying career designing 3D models for a car company, and Midori is a university student intent on pursuing her dream as a story writer. These five girls will learn that the path to success is one with many diversions, but dreams can still be achieved through perseverance and a touch of eccentric creativity.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.35,8,188,388,350854,5914,"                              Shirobako is a love letter to the anime industry. It doesn't glorify it or portray animators as hyper-talented geniuses, and many of the characters in the show admit they do not even understand why they're working in the industry. But there's something that keeps them passionate about what they do, even if it may not be the most respected form of media out there. 
                              ~Multilingual review, English & Español: SHIROBAKO~
                              Out of curiosity, I've been thinking a lot about how anime are made, but it is fairly hard to get insights into the practices of this particular industry. And then, Shirobako came around.
                              I think it's common knowledge that two of the most important things in the world are doughnuts and anime. But when you combine those two things with well-written comedy, a plethora of memorable characters, and a realistic and interesting story, you receive something so great that it literally revives an entire genre of animation that has been becoming less and less creative as years go by. This mixture can be referred to as Shirobako, which can also go by the name of Watch This Show Because It Is Probably The Best Thing Ever. I'm not kidding. There's so much packed within the confines of this          
                              Every so often an anime comes around that, while certainly not perfect, fully deserves a 10/10 rating. There are anime which get their 10/10 rating by being masterful works which envelope your senses and bring you on an exciting journey - but then there are also anime which change your perception, and change the way you think about certain things, which make them equally deserving. Shirobako is the latter. When initially hearing about and watching the first few episodes of Shirobako I certainly expected to find it interesting and insightful, I never would have thought that it would change my perception on anime, and ultimately          
                              There are many ideas the average viewer thinks about when they are asked what makes an anime work for them. Is it the driving narrative that help to construct the pieces of the story? Is it the lovable cast of characters that help drive the story to its own path? Is it the breathless, but invigorating and vibrant animation that help to bring it to life? Is it the overall palatable visual design that help to give the show its identity? Is it the mesmerizing voice acting and sound direction that help to make it memorable?
                              Ever wanted to know how anime is made? The magic behind the scenes is always something I’m sure almost any anime fan would want to know. Shirobako opens up that curtain of magic as it brings together a show that discusses about making anime. It’s almost a dream like come true for anyone who has a fascination in the art of crafting anime. Thanks to P.A Works, that fascination can now become a reality.
                              'Bakuman' became a cult hit by giving manga fans a look inside the industry. If the manga about manga can do well, why not an anime about anime? Much like 'Bakuman', 'Shirobako' delivers a high level of enjoyment and information, but threadbare plot and character development keep it from being anything beyond a fun ride.
                              Shirobako is a good choice for you if you want to have a look into the anime industry but without events and characters seeming like they progress in a natural or realistic fashion, but still giving you somewhat of a decent insight into the industry regardless.
                              Shirobako is an anime about making anime. In this sense it feels very different to most shows you might have seen but different doesn't have to mean bad. At first I was a little sceptical about the show, after all, how exciting can an anime ABOUT anime be? Although at the same time, I was also a bit curious about what exactly would be in the show. If you've been watching anime for a while, then I really would recommend you take the chance, because the odds are that you won't regret it, it really helps you appreciate anime more. Even if you are relatively          
                              Have any of these questions ever passed through your mind while watching anime? “Why did that last anime you watch have a dodgy scene of animation in the last episode?” “Why did the animation style start to seem to slacken off as the show progressed?” “Why on earth did the show choose to not stay closer to the source material?” If so then Shirobako – the anime about making anime - can provide reasons for you delivered in an entertaining and memorable package. This labour of love from P.A. Works is one of my favourite shows I’ve been lucky enough to watch of late. It’s          
                              Shirobako is yet another series I watched on a whim and which ended up surprising me in a very good way.
                              We all love anime. Otherwise we wouldn't be on this site.

                              Pui Pui Molcar is arguably the most enjoyable anime ive ever had the pleasure to watch! The characters are adorable (guinea pigs are super underrated!!), the soundtrack is perfect for the type of show it is, and the characters are lovable even without any dialogue :)
                              It is so rare to find any type of short series that span under 13 episodes without declining in quality over its duration due to various factors such as the abundance of inconsistencies in the story, or rehashing the same narrative structural wise, which is pretty common in short running series. Other limiting factors are the available funds for its execution, or its own popularity, which can induce authors to change the course of the story. However, there is one title that managed to evade said issues, being an adaptation of a series of novels by Tomoki Misato, with a shot production of 10 ONA          
                              I never thought there's come a day where I can confidently say that I am enjoying a kids show, but here I am... INTRODUCING THE BEST ANIME OF THE SEASON! Say hello to Pui Pui Molcar, it currently has 8 episodes out and each ep is only 2 minutes long. It's the most adorable and greatest thing I've seen in a hot minute. It's about these hamster cars that do life, yes they do life.

                              It's very rare when you get something that is so simple, but yet so powerful. Shelter really reminds me why I love anime. It gives us such unique and fantastic experiences that's hard to find anywhere else.
                              Shelter tells the story about a girl that comes to realize the situation that she is in, and how it affects her. The story details the ways in which her life played out before an ""incident"" and the aftermath of it. A really well produced and powerful piece of art that really tells a nice story. The only thing that hampers the work is its incredibly short length, although I also think that that is one of its strong suits. Very touching, and very well thought out. If this could be turned into a full project I would absolutely watch more. There is definitely potential          
                              Shelter is, basically, a condensate of every single element of tear-jerk shows, sad videos and others things like this.
                              Shelter is most beautiful thing I have ever seen in my life but it is not an anime. 
                              ""Shelter"" is the music video/""short film"" for the Porter Robinson and Madeon collaborative EDM track of the same name. Many media outlets were excitedly sharing the news of this groundbreaking piece of media, a western musician and a Japanese animation studio working together to create something (a concept people seem to forget is not new at all). I was initially excited too, being a fan of Porter Robinson's music. However, once I actually watched it, my hype slowly drained away and he obvious truths of the situation set in.
                              I wasnt expecting much from a 6 minute anime, Ive been dissapointed in the past, but this time i was proved wrong.
                              Holy hell. I've read many different opinions about this MV now and let me just get this out of the way. It's not as good as Porter fans/ anime connoisseur make it out to be, and it's by far not as bad as some anti-mainstream hipsters say. People that give this piece everything under 5 are either lying to make themselves fell better and/or stand out or they just have not watched enough shows to even know what truly awful feels like. I saw that some people gave this piece a 1 for incredible exaggerated reasons. It's a fucking music video. It's 6 minutes long.          
                              I have never written a review before, and I never planned on doing such on this site, but I have to make an exception for Shelter. In my opinion, Shelter is a showcase of what so many anime are missing, complied in 6 minutes of compact emotions. Obviously, given the length of the video, there is not a whole lot of room for dialogue, character development, or story in general. However, Shelter manages to touch on each just enough to invoke the feelings of sympathy and empathy for the MC.
                              Shelter is a music video. It's nothing less, and nothing more.
                              Wow, so I see that a lot of cynicism managed to reach top reviews on MAL.
                              It's quite hard to review music videos, and in this case it's anime related and went viral instantly. Leading all the masses to watch it since It's only 6 minutes long. 
                              Shelter is a short six minute music video produced by A-1 Pictures that has been gaining a lot of positive reviews lately and I can't pinpoint why exactly. Sure the music video looks fantastic from an animation perspective with great background work, fantastic art and design coupled with great animation and flow. I liked the final message of how it is important to move on with your life and felt it was a strong idea to leave out on. The song itself is okay, but this boils down more so to personal preference than an actual critique of this short video.
                              This is the first time that I have ever seen an anime video with duration less than 7 mins,yet my feelings have been spilled out throughout my heart.
                              Although it is far from perfect, ""Shelter"" is a well-done anime music video that manages to deliver some thoughtful moments to the audience. In its short timespan, it manages to deliver a memorable story that compliments the music of Porter Robinson and Madeon. Fans of anime and the two electronic music artists will undoubtedly find ""Shelter"" worthy of their time."
"A few months after the events of Steins;Gate, Rintarou Okabe and his group of friends are invited to tag along with their acquaintance Faris NyanNyan, who is participating in a Rai-Net battle event in the United States. There, they meet up with an old colleague: Kurisu Makise, who has been recalling fragmented memories of events that happened in the other world lines in the form of dreams. She confronts Okabe, questioning him as to whether these events—particularly the incidents between the two of them—did indeed happen.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.34,8,190,406,340713,793,"                              I am a huge fan of the Steins;Gate series, but this is a really unnecessary addition which has nothing to say.
                              Steins;Gate is still one of my favorite series of all time because it makes you cry, laugh and feel something you've never felt before. In the time I finished steins;gate series, I decided to watch this.
                              After marathoning the whole TV series I could not resist watching its sequel, this OVA, Oukoubakku no Poriomania (or in English, Egoistic Poriomania) right away - and I was not disappointed at all. It is just as beautiful as its prequel, and I am talking about the final scene. It was not serious, but it would be redundant anyway. Feiris has to go to America and invites her friends - the laboratory members. They visit Kurisu, but she lost her memories about the other world lines, but her life in the other world lines always appears in her dreams. The kiss scene in episode 22          
                              NNNOOOOOOSSTTTALGIAAAAAAAAAA DRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYBU~
                              I remember when I finished Steins;Gate. I was left yearning for more, that last speck of satisfaction and glowing epicness that just made me.....feel perfect. But knowing that Steins;Gate was so epic, I didn't want it to go on, simply because sequels usually, quite frankly, suck. But then again, this wasn't a Hollywood movie; no, that's because it was so much more. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you: Steins;Gate, tying up loose ends.
                              Let's get one thing straight here, this extra episode does not ""tie up loose ends."" It's simply an episode premiering Suzuha's mom, and reinforcing that yes, now Okabe and Makise are ""together"" again. Other than that, it is just a comedic relief episode, with almost no real content in it. It's not terrible by any means really, if you liked the series then yes, you will like this added episode, but this was not even close to needed.
                              Personally, I started watching Steins;Gate because of its plot which involves time travel time paradoxes, and etc. The problem with this special episode is that it contains little to no ""essence"" of what Steins;Gate really was all about.
                              “It's time to say goodbye, but I think goodbyes are sad and I'd much rather say hello.”
                              Oh the memories that this brings back...
                              Eagerly anticipating a sequel after a month having watched Steins;Gate, I was pleasantly blessed with an OVA special. 
                              It's just a special bonus episode, but... ***WARNING: SPOILERS*** anyways.
                              Steins;Gate: Oukoubakko no Poriomania is exactly what you would expect from an epilogue episode. It picks up sometime after the series ended to show what become of the characters. Because of this it is not particularly watchable if you haven't seen the series but then again it is not intended to be. 
                               Tutturu...!!
                              If you are not a fan of Steins;Gate, then you will not enjoy this special episode. But if you are a fan, this is a good conclusion episode. It answered a lot of open questions that the main TV series left us, and gave a better picture of what's going to happen in the world line called Steins;Gate. 
                              This Steins;Gate special delivers about as ideally as you would expect from a Steins;Gate special. It looks and feels exactly like you'd expect it to, and it tackles some very relevant plot points. It's like a ribbon that nicely ties in some questions left over from the main series. "
"The heavens shake, the thunder rumbles, and Xie Lian appears with an apologetic smile—again! Eight hundred years prior, he was a beloved martial god, known as the Crown Prince of Xianle. Now, he ascends to the heavenly realm for the third time, but simply as a pitiful scrap-collecting god with no followers behind him. 

On his first mission, Xie Lian finds himself alone in the dark moonlit night. There, a gentle man dressed in red guides him through the forest. However, as abruptly as he appeared, the man suddenly dissipates into a swarm of silver butterflies.

Xie Lian later learns that this mysterious stranger was none other than Hua Cheng, the Crimson Rain Sought Flower, a Ghost King feared by both demons and gods alike. But before Xie Lian can figure out why Hua Cheng would help a Heavenly Official like himself, he meets San Lang. A young man possessing great knowledge on not only the Ghost King, but also the now forgotten Crown Prince, San Lang decides to accompany Xie Lian on his journey of unveiling the mysteries of the past.

                              Coming here to review the donghua after completing all 11 episodes. 
                              Outstanding, beginning to end. A pity that the end came so soon!, i seriously hope we get more seasons on this. 
                              It's an absolute masterpiece of an adaptation.
                              I found out this is another one of my favorite authors works so i was curious and watched it ,and i didn't regret it. The story is unique, very original ,just love it. At 1st i didnt know about the plot of this donghua but i fell in love with it just from watching one episode.
                              Eh, to be honest, it isn't that great. Don't get me wrong, it's good, but not gonna lie here, it's not that great, at least not as great as everyone is raving about. I was never a huge fan of the original novel, but some of the problems of the original are exemplified even more here. 
                              Sience my first language is not English, there may be some mistakes in this review.
                              Heaven Official's Blessing, a.k.a Tian Guan Ci Fu, a.k.a. TGCF is my first ""donghua"" ever. I haven't heard of it before, hence I realised it was very reasonable I haven't heard it before cause appearently it's considerably something new.
                              Disclaimer: I have not read the original source material and am fairly new to this genre.
                              Much anticipated TGCF adapts a BL novel, but lacks much development details in the relationship. While I haven't read the source material, I can't help but feel something was missing. For much of the show Xie Lian was almost weak and docile, like he couldn't wait to fall into the arms of a stranger he has just met. Such a notion lacks substance regardless of gender. There are no little touches nor moments that spark, and the relationship just seems to fall into place unwarranted, between two handsome men with no personalities. 
                              Story: 10
                              Is this the best that Chinese animation has to offer? Perhaps. Only time will tell.
                              I really love the story, and every element in it is top-notch. I gotta say, like many others, I'm obsessed with this donghua too. I too think that the production team had done an excellent job with this adaptation.  The characters, scenery, the songs, I love every single thing about this anime!:) 
                              After reading the novel back in 2019 it was like a dream come true finding out the donghua trailer to it.The whole story is a masterpiece, 10/10 - recommend!
                              So far, I'm still at episode 5 but in a summary it's basically about how a prodigious prince, Xie Lian cultivated to the point where he ascended into the heavens, and his fall from grace back to the mortal realm. One of the things I love about the show is how Xie Lian ascended to the heavens, only to realise that the heaven officials are just as, if not more petty, shallow and hypocritical then the mortals who are worshipping them. Xie Lian soon discovers that what the heavens find pleasing might not always be moral, in fact they often rooted in appealing to the          "
"After five years of harboring unspoken feelings, high-schooler Taiju Ooki is finally ready to confess his love to Yuzuriha Ogawa. Just when Taiju begins his confession however, a blinding green light strikes the Earth and petrifies mankind around the world—turning every single human into stone.

Several millennia later, Taiju awakens to find the modern world completely nonexistent, as nature has flourished in the years humanity stood still. Among a stone world of statues, Taiju encounters one other living human: his science-loving friend Senkuu, who has been active for a few months. Taiju learns that Senkuu has developed a grand scheme—to launch the complete revival of civilization with science. Taiju's brawn and Senkuu's brains combine to forge a formidable partnership, and they soon uncover a method to revive those petrified.

However, Senkuu's master plan is threatened when his ideologies are challenged by those who awaken. All the while, the reason for mankind's petrification remains unknown.

                              Having been a fan of Weekly Shonen Jump works for many years, their arsenal of genres continues to bring diversity to its audience. From ninjas in hidden villages to mages from magical guilds, it seems once in a while, there comes a new hot topic for fans to celebrate. Dr. Stone celebrates a post-apocalyptic adventure that serves as a love letter to science but also brings a refreshing look to its fans.
                              If Dr. Stone was a human being, it would be that one really annoying and narcissistic kid in class that thinks he knows everything about whatever sh*t and cr*p, but in reality, is just a whiny little p*ssy that nobody respects. I wish I could say that this analogy is 100% accurate, however, that is not the case as the fanbase, which encompasses of Turbo virgin redditors and other uneducated meaningless lifeforms, deeply respect and defend the show almost making it impossible to criticize. I get that this is a shounen and all, so there are bound to be some “illogical” things here and there,          
                              Dr. Stone is amazing
                              Have you ever thought that the civilization now, which we built more than 200,000 years will be destroyed in a few seconds? Dr. Stone tells the story of a modern world that was destroyed because everyone turned to stone. I don't know even I don't want to know why they turned to stone. Senku who wants to accelerate science and bring it to the stone world. He tried to build a modern civilization to restore it to normal. Focuses on two things namely natural science and moral science, while the story itself, seems boring and unattractive because with that difference they create conflict that is          
                              Local turnip hair kid wakes up in a prehistoric future and uses the power of science and improbable percentages in an attempt to beat the anime version of Sid Meier's Civilization in record time.
                              Thrilling and satisfying, but imperfect and some times ugly, are the words I would use to describe dr.stone. While on other shounen animes you can only get the satisfaction at the end of an arc that takes dozen of episodes to get to, this anime does it in less than three episodes by putting smaller goals. Although, that doesn't mean it the best anime ever or even this season. The rewarding feeling that you get every few episodes is enough to make up for a ton of its flaws and make it memorable.
                              I was quite interested in this series going into it, with such an interesting premise it had a lot of potential to be something great. To have everyone get turned into stone and have our protagonist awaken 3,700 years later where he has to re-build society from scratch makes for a lot of interesting possibilities. However before this series was able to take advantage of this premise they drove it off a cliff by introducing what can best be described as a communist gorilla. I guess it couldn't be a shounen jump series without a shitty villain, huh?
                              Dr. Stone is an anime with a fascinating premise and a very intriguing world. On first pass, it looks competently animated, the plot progression is quite enjoyable, and hints at fascinating themes. With all those features, surely this series had to be quite great and I’m writing a rave review of it. Right? Well, in this stone world impossible things are possible. Despite all this series had going for it, it was wildly, ridiculously flawed. Dr. Stone is sophomorically directed, cartoonishly over-acted, and the largely decent soundtrack is used incorrectly. It’s childishly written, and its characters were unbearably cliché and plastic. It’s somehow simultaneously annoyingly          
                              Do you know who the strongest man alive is?
                              a friend of mine gave me the advice to watch me, speaking about how scientific this series is. i' ve found nothing about science in this series, at least if we don't consider some elementary school level things. totally overrated.

I hope you'll bear with me here, this is going to be a bit of a personal review, but I'll try to be fair. My anger has vanished in most parts although if someone says the words ""sabisu sabisu"" for a tease I still feel like kicking his butt delinquent-style.
                              Firstly, as if it needs to be pointed out, things in this movie have irrevocably changed from the TV Series. So different are the events in this movie, that, even with the 30 second preview at the end of the film, I have no clue what’s going to happen in the next movie (which will be called Evangelion Q, Quickening). Another thing is that things that were considered mysteries of the original TV series and movies are either gone altogether, changed, or spelled out.
                              Yup, that's a hot row of 10s right there, blatant and unabashed praise for the Evangelion Rebuild series, or as it should really be called; ""Anno's Attack on Anime"". Here's the truth: as an out-of-context standalone, this movie is a sack of shit. It's essentially harem-shonen-mecha-explosions with shallow characters all defined by their unexplained and nonsensical heart throbbings for Shinji, God of War. It doesn't present itself in this way, though: it's actually incredibly smart about it, sticking close to the original series in regards to content but constantly cutting and changing small things so that the end result is something that appears to be          
                              I know the Evangelion World since i was 11, and watched the whole serie for over 10 times, and when i knew that 4 more movies were about to come out, i couldn't wait for watch them.
                              Somehow, NGE has been turned into a high school harem comedy with giant robots.  There is pretty animation, but terrible direction, cinematography, music, and sound ruin that as well.          
                              I have waited for the opportunity to watch the new Evangelion for the long time. Today I have to admit that I am strongly surprised because of the enthusiastic reception of this movie. This is certainly a good position but it lacks a lot to be called a masterpiece.
                              I liked Evangelion 1.0, the ""cube"" angel had a great development and made the movie worth.

                              If you haven't seen the original Evangelion TV-series nor the first Rebuild-film, go watch them now. If you would like to read a potent critical view on the newest effort by Studio Khara and Gainax, read Liberal's rant a few reviews below. And if you feel like you're up to hearing another fanboy declaring his newfound love for this legendary mecha-anime, then read on.
                              I literally hate reviewing Evangelion. It's one of those series that you have to fully understand to enjoy it the most. Many people fail to do it. They tend to see only the shallow part of this show - mecha battles and romance (?) between some characters. Wrong. But it's not my cup of tea (yet) to change your mind on that dear fellas ;].
                              There are many English idioms about third attempts. Third time lucky, third time's the charm, and I'm sure there's a third one. The first time you try something, you inevitably screw up because you've never done it before. The second time you have a better grasp of what you're doing but perhaps haven't developed the expertise yet. Surely this next time around, you'll be able to get it right?
                              So, I've heard that this film lost out to Summer Wars in many festivals. Now, if that was a fair assessment, then Summer Wars must be one of the greatest movies ever made, because Evangelion 2.0 has set a new bar. Never in my life have I seen such great animation, this beautiful mix of 2D and 3D by sheer technical prowess has left other anime in the dust. Also, it is still one of the greatest stories ever told in anime. The subtle reimagining of the characters is brilliant, although I think it went a bit too far in making the characters more likable.          
                              I know many won't like this review, but I'm going to say my feelings anyway. However, I will point out that I'm looking at this in comparison to the TV series as I haven't read the manga.
                              Critic's Log - Earthdate: January 23, 2013. Review #31: Evangelion 2.0: You Can (Not) Advance.
                              Evangelion 2.0 is the second part of the rewrite of the popular NGE series, dubbed the ""Reubuild"" of Eva. It picks up after 1.0 and episode 8 or so of the original series. Now I remember watching 1.0 and I wasn't particularly impressed with it. Sure it had new shiny animation, soundtrack and so on, but it didn't really bring anything new to the table. In fact it followed the original series painstakingly to the mark, so it made me kinda skeptical about the whole rewrite aspect of this 4-part series. In hindsight, it was probably for the best since 1.0 slowly eases us back          "
"With the promise of granting any wish, the omnipotent Holy Grail triggered three wars in the past, each too cruel and fierce to leave a victor. In spite of that, the wealthy Einzbern family is confident that the Fourth Holy Grail War will be different; namely, with a vessel of the Holy Grail now in their grasp. Solely for this reason, the much hated ""Magus Killer"" Kiritsugu Emiya is hired by the Einzberns, with marriage to their only daughter Irisviel as binding contract.

Kiritsugu now stands at the center of a cutthroat game of survival, facing off against six other participants, each armed with an ancient familiar, and fueled by unique desires and ideals. Accompanied by his own familiar, Saber, the notorious mercenary soon finds his greatest opponent in Kirei Kotomine, a priest who seeks salvation from the emptiness within himself in pursuit of Kiritsugu.

Based on the light novel written by Gen Urobuchi, Fate/Zero depicts the events of the Fourth Holy Grail War—10 years prior to Fate/stay night. Witness a battle royale in which no one is guaranteed to survive.

                              I’m fairly confident this review is going to get near as damn 0% helpful marks simply because of my ratings. If anyone feels what I said wasn’t helpful in this review, drop me a message, if you disagree with something I said, drop me a message, thanks. 
                              Every once in awhile there will be an epic masterpiece that appears which is truly outstanding and fascinating. Fate/Zero is one of them, and i believe it has the potential to be one of the best anime of the year.
                              Ufotable probably used the Holy Grail and granted the fan's wish.most of the fans turned their attention to fate/zero the moment they heard about the involvement of ufotable since they knew they could expect great things with other works they had seen from them.as we all know just having a good story won't make an anime good.how to adapt it and include the parts of the story,the good use of music and art and many other things are playing a big role in an anime.this anime didn't disappoint and tried hard to bring out the awesomeness.
                              I wrote a review for Fate/Zero before but it got deleted because it only talked about the fight scenes. So I'm including the story in this review as well. Enjoy. 
                              When I first started this anime, I thought it was very good, but then it took a turn for the worse and became piss poor. Why you say? Maybe because every character falls into a generic archetype, such as, Irisvile (weak defenseless female), Saber ( strong female), and a boring protagonist who hardly ever shows up, and is apparently cheating on his wife. Now getting to the story, for the most part, it consists of Irisvile clinging to Saber's underwear while acting as a defenseless female who has no where better to be but involved in this Grail War which the shows speaks of a          
                              The main flaws with this anime are that it's dialogue heavy and the fights are ultimately pointless.

                              Fate/Zero is a show as confident in its storytelling as it is confused in its aims. After many tries, I've filed it away still unable to describe what point Urobuchi is trying to make with this. The closest I've come is that it's a condemnation of idealism, but this is only weakly supported by the text, and I suspect that impression is more a function of it being a prequel to a visual novel that thoroughly affirms the great moral significance of ideals. In that light, Fate/Zero's grim, cynical ending merely serves a narrative purpose. This doesn't make it unwatchable or even bad, but it          
                              In almost all forms of media, spinoffs, sequels, and prequels all have one thing in common. They are a crap shoot. Most of the time these spinoffs suck. Fortunately in anime, that is not always the case. In fact there are several times where I find myself enjoy the sequel/ prequel better than the original. However this anime is true rarity, in which the prequel just about outdoes the original in virtually every aspect. This review focuses solely on the first season of fate/zero. I'll write a separate review for season 2. 
                              Where do I begin with Fate/Zero? The first time I watched this series (roughly two years ago) I, admittedly, adored it. However, I recently rewatched it after reading the Fate/Stay Night light novel. It was then that my opinion of the seriess dropped substantially. Don't worry! This won't be a review where I bitch about how Fate/Zero messed up the characters that had been lovingly crafted in Fate/Stay Night! Indeed, I will try my best not to mention that wonderful novel (and godawful fanbase) and will instead focus on analyzing the content at hand. There will, however, be MILD SPOILERS. Consider yourself warned.
                              **SPOILER FREE REVIEW OF BOTH SEASONS (NOT FATE/STAY NIGHT)**
                              Fate/Zero will likely go down as one of anime’s best, or at least most famous prequels. Split into two seasons with 3 months between the airing of each, each half essentially becomes one of the highlights of their respective years. Season 1 is the more difficult of the two to tackle, as it’s primarily setting the stage for the tragedy that unfolds later on as it begins planting some of the seeds that would lead into the 3 well-known routes of Fate/Stay Night. It’s easy to praise the cinematic approach the show’s director, Ei Aoki, takes here. Both seasons are more strikingly directed than even          
                              I'm sorry, but this anime is simply atrocious."
"According to Aniplex, a 10min short anime of Gintama ""Shiroyasha Koutan"" will be released on September 30th. It was shown at Jump Super Anime Tour 2008 and had never been released as a DVD.

It's a trailer of an imaginary Gintama movie. Gintama OVA shown at Jump Anime Tour '05 is also included in the DVD.",8.34,8,195,2183,53606,100,"                              Sunrise recognised the demand for a Gintama movie and so took the concept of a teaser, expanded it a little and made Shiroyasha Koutan for the 2008 Jump Anime Tour event. With only a little information and the runtime to go on, many fans assumed the special would be ten full minutes of action - perhaps a full sequence - set during the Joui war, possibly covering sections of main character Gintoki's past. The end result was completely unexpected, but so in Gintama's nature and an absolute treat for fans.
                              To sum it up simply, the first 3-4 minutes is presented in a serious and somewhat epic manner, revealing a bit of character background and story, along with great quality fighting scenes and of course heartmoving dialogue. 
                              The first part of the Jump Festa Gintama OVA series 2 gave you a serious note but then again, you got silver-trolled.
                              The Gintama series loves to troll it's viewers with false announcements like it's 'cancellation' and a 'Shinsengumi movie' apart from many other trolls (the biggest of which was a movie of the Benizakura arc which was a reality) and this was no other. Sunrise knows that it's fans want a Gintoki background story and they delivered one... Just kidding.
                              So, this ""trailer"" is basically a few minutes of Gintoki, Katsura, Sakamoto, and Takasugi in the Joui war, and the rest of the time is taken up by the characters complaining that Gintama hadn't gotten a movie yet (by 2008) and other characters complaining that they want more screen time."
"Kino, a 15-year-old traveler, forms a bond with Hermes, a talking motorcycle. Together, they wander the lands and venture through various countries and places, despite having no clear idea of what to expect. After all, life is a journey filled with the unknown. 

Throughout their journeys, they encounter different kinds of customs, from the morally gray to tragic and fascinating. They also meet many people: some who live to work, some who live to make others happy, and some who live to chase their dreams. Thus, in every country they visit, there is always something to learn from the way people carry out their lives. 

It is not up to Kino or Hermes to decide whether these asserted values are wrong or right, as they merely assume the roles of observers within this small world.

That's because in one way or another, they believe things are fine as they are, and that ""the world is not beautiful; therefore, it is.""

                              What do you say about an anime that is just about a traveler, journeying to different countries on the back of her talking motorcycle.  Sounds boring, right?  WRONG!!!  This episodic anime, through odd little stories and dialogue, actually explores different aspects of human nature, in one of the most unique ways I have ever seen.
                              I stumbled onto this anime without knowing what to expect. Once I started watching it, I became very moved by it.
                              One of the biggest criticisms the anime medium constantly faces is that it merely a form of entertainment.  With the abundance of shows, especially in the recent years, that are evidently nothing more than blatant attempts to cater to hormone-overflowing young men with endless amounts of fanservice, it is easy to see why many skeptics share this common misconception.  And while there are numerous titles that break the mold and provide watchers with much more than just flashy action sequences featuring gun-toting, well-endowed girls, a great deal are quickly forgotten, destined to only be watched by a small fraction of individuals who are          
                              These 13 episodes are packed with compelling storylines all revolving around the character of Kino who is journeying from fictional country to country on her motorbike.
                              “Someone once told me that watching the birds made them want to go on a journey.”
                              Title: Kino no Tabi: The Beautiful World
                              I was reminded of some lines I'd long since forgotten:
                              Overview:
                              It's difficult to sum up Kino's Journey in words. The only  words that come close are unique and stunning. The premise is simple. It follows the journey of a traveler and her talking motorcycle as they travel from place to place and encounter many unusual cultures and customs in the process. However, this simple summary falls short of giving a potential viewer any deep sense of what they're about to see. Each episode explores elements of society and human nature with a rare sense of beauty, touching upon the addressed themes with a sense of pathos that entire series dedicated to them may fail          
                              A journey can be a pivotal point in a person’s life.  It provides an opportunity for a person to experience a new world where they encounter new ideas and do things they have never done before.  More importantly, a journey allows is a time of self-discovery.  Interacting with a new culture forces a person to evaluate their own beliefs and customs that may seem natural to them, but may soon learn they are not intuitive.  It is also an opportunity to see that there are things that are universal for all cultures.  It is this power that a journey has          
                              ""Warning: Kino's Journey has been known to induce a strong feeling of wanderlust in its viewers. It has also been proven to boost levels of empathy. Watch at your own risk.""
                              My shorthand way of describing Kino’s Journey is that it’s Aesop’s Fables the Anime. The characters do not act like real humans, nor do their dialogue and actions seem like those of normal humans. That is because it is not a story about people. It’s a story about society. It’s about democracy and religion and work and the things we take for granted because we do not question these societal constructs.
                              Kino's Journey:"
"Following their triumph against Yousen High, Seirin's basketball team has reached the semifinals of the Winter Cup along with Kaijou, Rakuzan, and Shuutoku. Each of these teams possesses a member of the Generation of Miracles, and Seirin prepares to face the largest obstacles on their path to winning the Winter Cup.

In the final season of Kuroko no Basket, Kuroko goes head-to-head with his old teammates once more as he attempts to show them that individual skill is not the only way to play basketball. His firm belief that his form of basketball, team play, is the right way to play the sport will clash with the talents of a perfect copy and an absolute authority.

While Kuroko tries to prove that his basketball is ""right,"" he and the rest of Seirin High ultimately have one goal: to win the Winter Cup and overcome the strength of the Generation of Miracles, who have long dominated the scene of middle and high school basketball.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.34,8,197,229,514779,4549,"                              At this point, Kuroko no Basket (Kuroko’s Basketball) is a series that needs no introduction. After two seasons of competitive gameplay, we have the third and final season to conclude the entire story based off the manga written by Tadatoshi Fujimaki. If you’re really anxious to see how the Winter Cup will be decided and who will earn the ultimate glory, then this is a must-see for KnB fans. Otherwise, I confess to myself that the third season is a bit of a hit or miss.
                              Finally... I got to finish this anime. Even few hours after I finished watching, adrenaline still overflowing inside of me. I really enjoy this season. Okay, before reviewing, I have read all the manga chapters before the anime even started the third season. Even though I did enjoy reading it, I was not that hyped up for the ending... but the anime did the reverse. With solid story as the base, characters we have grown to love, animated in such an astounding way, this is one of the rare case when I feel more enjoyment with the anime. 
                              First of all, I will clear things out by saying, that I am a big fan of season 1 & 2 of this anime series. I liked almost everthing about those two anime. Eventhough with such a great prequels the third season felt a bit too repetitive. While watching this anime I felt like I have watched the same things in season one & two. The thing that I loved about the first two seasons was character development which was somewhat missing in season 3. The story is good and it give the whole in depth backstory of all the players. This backstory helps viewer          
                              I'm gonna say it and i'm gonna say it now: KnB is the most predictable, shounen-like and overrated anime i have ever seen. We all know why it's rated so high: it is very enjoyable and flashy. It's like a weak version of Bleach, with more cliches and totally unjustified powers, since we're talking about basketball, not shinigamis.
                              Brilliance, that's the most accurate term I can think of when describing pathetic Kuroko no Basket anime series. To me it's something so exciting and so addicting that I can't help but love it, even for someone who doesn't really care for basketball such as myself. Basically what the third season of this series covers is the Generation of miracle's lives in middle school and the conclusion of the winter cup. So what does this season do correctly? Well season 3 doesn't only supply character development, it introduces an awesome character namely Akashi. What makes Akashi great character is his whole split personality characteristic, and          
                              *If you haven't watch the series yet, see my first season review instead. I also won't repeat the things I've said from my first season review.
                              This is my very first review EVER, so please bear with me. KnB is the first sports anime I've ever seen and actually finished. Starting from season one all the way til the last episode I literally just cried over twenty minutes ago. This story is great, you never get bored and it keeps you on the edge of your seat, believe me. The art is AMAZING! I'm a sucker for vibrant colors and good animations. The art is smooth and fits very well with the show. The sound is perfect. It adds to the intensity of the show and the emotions. All of the          
                              I can't believe it just ended like that. I'm like nooo if anyone saw Akatsuki no Yona it ended just like that but in a different way of course. I just felt it ended to fast and man I wish it could be more. Anyway, I loved the skits the series had and the characters where reminiscing. The action. Movements. And Everything about it XD my favorites are Aomine and Kuroko since they're full of surprises and there reactions are priceless when the unexpected happens. The art in this anime is amaazing it really fits for a 2014-2015 anime and the sounds you can hear

                              So this is my first review, so any feedback would be nice :3
                              Edit: Review has been updated to when I have seen all the series' three seasons and even rewatched it:
                              I just want to start off by explaining my stance on sports anime. For the most part I tend to dislike them. It's not that I don't like sports, in fact I partake in both tennis and golf in real life on a regular basis. My issue with a lot of sports anime is that they tread a strange line between trying to be realistic and give an accurate presentation of that sport whilst stretching the realism of said presentation to the limits. This grey area between fiction and non-fiction often results in a uninvestable environment. My other big problem with sports anime is the

"Two souls, living very different lives, wander alone and isolated in their respective worlds. For nine-year-old Ren, the last person who treated him with any form of kindness has been killed and he is shunned by what is left of his family. With no parents, no real family, and no place to go, Ren escapes into the confusing streets and alleyways of Shibuya. Through the twists and turns of the alleys, Ren stumbles into the intimidating Kumatetsu, who leads him to the beast realm of Shibuten.

For Kumatetsu, the boy represents a chance for him to become a candidate to replace the Lord of the realm once he retires. While nearly unmatched in combat, Kumatetsu's chilly persona leaves him with no disciples to teach and no way to prove he is worthy of becoming the Lord's successor. 

While the two share different goals, they agree to help each other in order to reach them. Kumatetsu searches for recognition; Ren, now known as Kyuuta, searches for the home he never had. As the years pass by, it starts to become apparent that the two are helping each other in more ways than they had originally thought. Perhaps there has always been less of a difference between them, a boy and a beast, than either of the two ever realized.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.33,8,199,458,309521,2705,"                              Saw this at the BFI film festival yesterday. Was quite disappointed actually, for reasons I've already read above. The plot felt rushed, the characters one dimensional and the overall world lacked depth. The main antagonist appeared out of nowhere towards the end for no other reason than the plot needed him to.
                              Mamoru Hosada is basically to Japanese animation what Disney is to Western animation: one of the better players in the field, but far from the best the medium has to offer. Just like Disney has never been able to produce a movie that my pre-college self would have loved but my post-college self just finds alright, I'm not too keen on rewatching any of Hosada's films these days whether or not I think they're good. Whilst the character animation being distractingly un-detailed compared to the rest of the animation is a bit of a sticking point in his films, my main problem with him are          
                              Hosoda continues to make films that are incredibly enjoyable to watch.  Bakemono no Ko (The Boy and the Beast), his first film produced under the banner of Studio Chizu, is another great addition to his directorial repertoire.  I was lucky to catch this film in theaters and my impression  is better for it.
                              Hosoda is here again with another modern tale, expanding the themes from his last movie about coexisting with another species.  At first glance, the movie feels like his 2006 feature The Girl Who Leapt Through Time in terms of atmosphere. They both start with a chill slice of life feeling that gains weight as it progresses. The difference is that TGWLTT is more likeable, whereas The Boy And The Beast takes a good 20 minute for you to get invested with the world and characters here presented. 
                              I wanted to like this anime so much. I saw everyone's reviews and recommendations and I had high hopes. 
                              Now I can't speak for everyone else because people will view and receive movies differently based on their experience. That being said, for me this Movie was a Masterpiece and would beg people to watch this movie who are into anime.  It is my favorite one out his other works. Didn't really care for Wolf children, just not my cup of tea, not that is was bad or anything just kinda boring for what I like to get out of movies. Summer wars was pretty good but this takes the cake. Apart from that I feel the anime speaks for itself, it had great          
                              Story: 8/10 What surprised me about the story was how fast it was and how many elements they were able to squeeze in. It almost felt as though it was written as a miniseries with different episodes focusing on different aspects, which they then turned into a film. Similarly, they also got in an abundance of morals and messages. Don't roll your eyes yet, because they're portrayed as realistically as possible for the scenarios, and only a couple are shoved in your face. However, as a side-effect of the pace and jumping focus, it felt rather disjointed at times, which is why I'm docking points.
                              Three years after Wolf Children, Hosoda comes back with a new epic featuring more drama based around the animal side of man: unfortunately, it's not as good as any of his past work, not because of the stagnant themes but for the sheer mediocrity of it.
                              I just returned from seeing The Boy and the Beast as part of the Glasgow Film Festival. I'd originally planned to stick around in the city afterwards but, feeling compelled to sit down and think about the movie, I just took the early train back to Edinburgh where I'm currently writing this review. That's right, I took an hour long train ride to see two hours of anime.
                              My first review on MAL and it being on a movie from Mamoru Hosoda, One of the Greats in the making was a treat. I'll be breaking down the movie from what I liked the most to least then an Overall Impression.
                              Synopsis:
                              I know that teacher-disciple themes are old school but ""The Boy And The Beast"" is unique.
                              Bakemono no Ko is a 2015 film written and directed by Hosoda Mamoru. We talked about him yesterday with Ookami Kodomo. I guess people just want to see me look at his films this year. So, how does this compare to his other two films I've reviewed? Will it be the first bad one? The best one yet? Exactly in between the other two? Let's find out, shall we?
                              ""Overall, the plot to this movie was absolutely insulting, and I feel it didn't use it's time well at all (which is impressive when it's goddamn 2 hours long), and the world it tries to set up is an absolute joke. Like the sweet, soothing melodies of Cannibal Corpse... ...the Boy and the Beast is: 
                              At first I expected, ""Oh, all right, this will gonna be one of those Hollywood movie where the master teaches this outsider kid, huh?"". I expected a fucking Karate Kid."

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.32,8,213,13,1640156,19037,"                              After watching the first season of Boku Hero no Academia (My Hero Academia), I can’t help but feel wanting for more of this series. The first season consisted of only 13 episodes. It adapted the general premise of the story and had its character roster in set. However, it missed the opportunity to expand more and build on those elements. Have no fear. Season 2 is here and it’s set to fill the gaps for you diehard fans of this classic shounen adventure.
                              *Minimum Spoiler Plus Ultra Review*
                              This is a two-part review where I'll be weighing in the positives and negatives of this show. 
                              I know this might sound exaggerated — “2/10? Are you insane?” — but please just hear me out for a second...
                              Boku no Hero Academia is often said to be the new Naruto or One Piece - the next smash-hit action series. Season 1 laid the groundwork for that, but at a mere 13 episodes, it couldn't truly demonstrate why Hero Academia deserves to be considered THE new great action series. But with season 2 comes a solid 25-episode run, giving it the chance to spread its wings and prove that not only is it a great successor to the old genre greats, but in many respects improves on them.
                              This review covers both seasons and will contain some vague spoilers.
                              I really did try to go into this with a positive attitude. I wanted to like it. This season could have very well been 12 episodes instead of the excruciatingly drawn out 25. Really all that tells me is VERY. POOR. WRITING. With this show being so popular and having such a high MAL score I had high expectations. I am being sorely let down. I didn't even want to finish watching this season. I usually only drop shows if it is boring me to death. I was almost to my limit with this one. 
                              The shounen that took Naruto's place was a huge disappointment for me and I will try to explain why here. I do not think that this review will change a lot of opinions, but I found it fun to write this, so here is a piece of my mind.
                              This show is completely for kids... i dont know why so many peoples like this anime.. so many points i dont understand like....
                              The goddamn hero ideology....why.....what is it with that naive hero mindset?! Let's talk about Endeavor, the guy literally ABUSES his wife, but he's still a hero?!!! You hypocritical pieces of shit!! Such an unoriginal and annoying anime! It overuses some of anime's most annoying tropes. They took the worst characteristics of all the Shounen MCs from the past 10 years and created Midoriya....one of the most frustrating characters I have ever come across. Makes this one of the most overrated shows in Anime history. I really don't understand the charm of a nerdy coward, who is very very unrealistically nice to everyone. Although have to          
                              Uh ok, so ... the only progress from Midoriya we see is after season 1, and after the first part of season 2? Is this a joke right? i mean... all of these episodes full of blah blah and fights, that made Todoroki have more mental progress than Midoriya. The MC keeps being a chiken after what we saw happened in first season, he is still full of openings like we saw through the whole story, but specially at that last episode.
                              (You must see season 1 first before you go to reviews of the 2nd season because there will be some spoilers about season 1.There will be some spoilers also from Season 2)
                              Season 2 is both the peak and fall of this show.
                              Note: This is a review for all of Boku no Hero Academia. The reason I chose this season to review was because in my opinion, this is overall the weakest entry in the series.

Meanwhile, despite losing his Servant and stumbling from injuries, Shirou ignores Rin's warning to abandon the battle royale, forcing his way into the fight against Caster. Determined to show his resolve in his will to fight, Shirou's potential to become a protector of the people is put to the test.

                              The franchise of Type-Moon. Fate/Stay Night is a trademark for what the product has been with its key characters, premise, and setting. Fate Unlimited Blade Works is one of its major routes and returns for another season. A show about the Holy Grail sparkles into a pendulum of events and animated by the infamous Ufotable studio. Part 1 delivered what many fans wanted while part 2 attempts to do so yet again.
                              When news about this series was launched, I somewhat had mixed feelings; the original Fate/Stay Night was so horrible, I pity myself for watching it, while Fate/Zero was absolutely fantastic, plus Ufotable, responsible for Fate/Zero, were producing it.
                              The Fate series holds a very special place in my heart, the escapades of Shirou Emiya and his servant Saber have enthralled me in a way that a lot of stories did not. From the romance in ""Fate"" to the climatic ""Heaven's Feel"", Fate/stay night hasn't just become one of my favorite stories, it's honestly become my favorite thing to come out of Japan.
                              Ever since I first watched Fate/Stay Night anime, I got hooked. A lot of people were complaining how it didn't live up to their expectations especially the ones who played the Visual Novel before, but as someone who didn't, I quite enjoyed the anime a bit. Of course afterwards I immediately went to play the game, and I managed to only finish the Fate route for some reason. Then I went to explore a bit for other TYPE-MOON series and discovering Tsukihime and Kara no Kyoukai, which the latter is one of my all time favorite.

                              The first cour had a great progress. However, it declined a bit this second cour.
                              The anime first of all had a different feeling compared to season one for me while the animation style was great as well as the sound the storyline didn't really indulge me as much as the first season did their wasn't that want for more really and the need to watch more and hate the fact that you had to wait a week to watch the next episode there was a lack of that really i mean some episode had a splash of cliff hangar but only three or four really did.

                              For visual novel readers and anime-only watchers alike, the attraction of the Ufotable-Type Moon pair-up is obvious.  Nasu's highly intricate and appealing designs brought to life by Ufotable, who are excellent in visuals and art.  This partnership works to great extent but was unfortunately lacking in the other important components such as character development, relatability and execution of the story that are needed to create a compelling narrative.
                              (This has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)
                              After the first season of FSN:UBW I had high hopes that the second season would make up for at least some of the issues I had with season 1.  It turns out it did not in almost any way.  I am not a reader of the VN, but that doesn't change the fact that a series needs to work as a standalone piece without the aid of extra information provided by the source material to completely enjoy it."
"After reuniting with Gon and his friends, Kurapika explained to them the risks he bears because of his abilities. Believing that his target of revenge is no longer alive and the search for his fallen comrade's eyes could truly begin, Kurapika soon after receives a message informing him that all the Spiders still lived. After much discussion between his friends, Gon, Kurapika and company decided to hunt after the one Spider member who's ability could ultimately result in Kurapika's defeat and death.

These episodes focus on Kurapica's quest for revenge and his eternal hunt for his clan member's eyes.
                              i get right to it...because i have no time to waste got to go watch the other OVA asap.
                              This review is for anyone who has seen the original series before the original. On the insistence of a friend, I binged the new series. I became addicted and went back to finish the originals, and here I am. All I have to say is: if you're here after watching the original series and liking it, you're not going to be disappointed. 
                              As I stated before, the original Hunter X Hunter Anime ended towards the end of the Yorkshin Arc, cutting off right after the gang finally gets back together. However that wouldn’t be the end of this Version of Hunter X Hunter. Oh no, for as you see, Nippon Animation was far from done with this series. What they decided to do once the televised run was over was to simply switch format, continuing the show in an OVA format instead. Hell, the Episode count doesn’t even reset with these OVAs, so you could just consider them Episodes 61-92 of the TV Series, which is how

                              K-ON may be a controversial series, and some may think anything to do with K-ON is nothing but overrated. Subjectively, I love the series. The daily school lives of the light music club and the live gigs, are never tiring to watch. Throughout season one and two, the series had shown us a simple, fun, relaxing and heart-warming ambiance through and through. As soon as the movie’s subs was out, it doesn’t take long for me to pop up my video player, and enjoy another near two hours of cuteness and fluffiness.
                              K-ON! was never a series with much direction but for many this wasn’t much of a problem. Thirty minutes of pleasant humour with a simple storyline to tie it together- a formula for success. However, when one attempts to stretch those thirty minutes of heaven into a two hour long movie, its weaknesses become apparent rather quickly. So the question is, will the K-ON! movie be able to overcome it?
                              Among Kyoto Animation's many shows, K-On seems to be one of the most divisive. The first Season was a fun but ultimately very empty and unrewarding experience which led to the attracting a lot of hate. Those who  stuck by it, however, where treated with a wonderful coming of age story and a bittersweet conclusion in the Second Season. Although Season 2 was a huge improvement it was not without its flaws. For a slice of life show, some thought thought that 26 episodes was too much. But for the fans, its long length was able to satisfy their craving for more K-On. But          
                              It's been a while since I looked at the first series of Kyoto animation's K-on. The final verdict for the series was that it was really good. Having a great sense of humour and being fun to watch. Someday, I'll undoubtedly get around to reviewing the second series but, for the time being, let's look at the film that came out in December of 2011. 
                              I watched 2 seasons of K-ON, the story is light, but for this one movie, I give ""standing applause"" because it has exceeded my expectations. K-On films can really take me into the story. when the beginning of the film began, I said whether K-On movie would provide beautiful music at the end, because for 2 seasons, I felt that the song that HTT performed not special. but apparently they can give me what I expect. beautiful music with deep meaning. thank you to all who have been instrumental in the process of adapting K-ON Films. You have managed to make me smile and hold          
                              Just saw this tonight in theaters in Japan.  It was super cute, had all the favorite characters and shenanigans (some of them just happen to be London, so there was some cute novelty, especially enjoyable for one who knows how awkward it is to be in a country where you're not fluent in the language, haha).  Definitely laughed out loud a couple times. The art was the same if not nicer than the anime, new songs were great and old classics were included as well. I'd say it's about the same as the TV show in that there wasn't much of a plot,          
                              When discussing 'moe', k-on is typically the first series that comes to mind for many people. It has represented for many, the pinnacle of 'cute girls doing cute things' and many take comfort in knowing that this is either as bad or as good as it gets for some. I don't like K-on. In fact, I hate it. I think it's one of the worst series in the industry. 
                              After-school Teatime's cinema debut was executed perfectly.
                              For the sake of perspective, let me first say that I am not a big fan of season one of K-ON. I thought it was overrated and dull. However, I am a moderate fan of season two, which was a lot more enjoyable. Maybe it's just because I already expected season two to be episodes and episodes of fluffy nothingness as opposed to season one where I was expecting a rockin' show about music. But whatever, the point is my opinion on K-ON before watching this movie was more or less ""meh.""
                              This is my first review, so bear with me. I'm not going to do the Story/Art/Sound etc. format. 
                              For anyone who wants to know K-On! is my favorite animated series of all time, and having recently just rewatched the movie I feel it is appropriate to try and explain just why I love it (K-On! Movie) so much.
                              This review will be controversial. The reason I say this is because although it seems paradoxical, in this review I will be shredding apart the “moe” phenomenon, while praising this movie at the same time. If that sounds incomprehensible to you then keep reading and maybe you’ll see where I’m coming from. By the way, I’m not going to say that much about the movie but talk more about my personal experience with “K-ON!” as a whole as well as other related anime.
                              I've seen it. Finally.
                              There is a reason why I rated this higher than the seasons shown on television. One immediate reason is that it truly sticks to the whole theme of the entire series.  "
"While most fifteen-year-old boys, in one way or another, harbor secrets that are related to girls, Takashi Natsume has a peculiar and terrifying secret involving youkai: for as long as he can remember, he has been constantly chased by these spirits. Natsume soon discovers that his deceased grandmother Reiko had passed on to him the Yuujinchou, or ""Book of Friends,"" which contains the names of the spirits whom she brought under her control. Now in Natsume's possession, the book gives Reiko's grandson this power as well, which is why these enraged beings now haunt him in hopes of somehow attaining their freedom.

Without parents and a loving home, and constantly being hunted by hostile, merciless youkai, Natsume is looking for solace—a place where he belongs. However, his only companion is a self-proclaimed bodyguard named Madara. Fondly referred to as Nyanko-sensei, Madara is a mysterious, pint-sized feline spirit who has his own reasons for sticking with the boy.

Based on the critically acclaimed manga by Yuki Midorikawa, Natsume Yuujinchou is an unconventional and supernatural slice-of-life series that follows Natsume as he, with his infamous protector Madara, endeavors to free the spirits bound by his grandmother's contract.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.33,8,203,325,413631,13560,"                              Natsume Yuujinchou is possibly the most powerful, thought-provoking anime I've ever seen. The amount of emotions you'll experience is nothing short of incredible, especially when you consider the anime's 13 episode length.
                              Honestly, I don't really understand why this anime has so many amazing ratings. This isn't the worst anime i've ever seen- no, but I certainly do not think it's anywhere near the best.
                              Oh my goodness, where to start.
                              No spoilers.
                              Natsume Yuujinchou follows the supernatural/natural genre that seems to be a cross between xxxholic, ghost hound and mushishi. It has a Mushishi-like elegance to the artwork and storytelling while at the same time following an xxxholic-esque structure aka. schoolboy meets schoolghost.
                              Why this anime is so far up the Top Anime list, I will never know because this was one of the worst animes I've ever watched. I'm disappointed I wasted so much of my precious time on this shit. The only reason I gave it an over 3 rather than a 2 was because I did the math. 
                              Watching Natsume Yuujinchou felt like strolling down a road of flawlessness - no obstructions, no inconveniences. Simply a straight, smooth and simple road that leads to the beautiful horizon which awaits at the end of the road. 
                              Natsume Yuujinchou is a series that began as a shoujo manga by Midorikawa Yuki. In 2008 an anime adaptation by Brain's Base aired. You may remember them from such anime as Baccano, Durarara, Penguindrum, Ixion Saga DT & Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru. So, their stuff has been pretty mixed from what I've seen. With Oregairu at the upper end and Ixion Saga & Penguindrum tied at the low end. How will this one place? Let's have a look.
                              This is my first anime review, so here goes.
                              NOTE: Since the content in all three seasons is similar enough that they don't warrant separate reviews, they will all be covered here. The fourth will be edited in when it finishes, unless it differs heavily from the first three by the end of its run.
                              I watched this anime basically on a whim. I read the name somewhere and just started watching it. I have to say that I wasn’t too impressed by this series by the first episode, but that certainly changed later on.
                              This is one of those animes which just somehow makes its way into your heart and makes such a deep imprint that you would probably never be able to forget it. Natsume Yuujinchou (I watched all 4 seasons, and reviewing them in one go as they are more like a single entity anyway) is a beautiful rare gem in the anime world that often goes unnoticed, yet each and every person I know who have watched it have been touched so deeply by it. 
                              ""Natsume's Book of Friends"" (Natsume Yuujinchou) is like a loaf of bread.  Not spicy, not over-sweet, pretty plain...and yet very satisfying.  It's a show I enjoy watching whenever life has been busy, complicated, or stressful, and I just want to clear my mind and relax.  When I don't want heavy plotlines, psychological twists, or violence.  When I crave something simple.
                              This is not an anime for people who are looking for something with action and cute characters. Natsume Yuujinchou is a thought provoking anime, one that encompasses many different genres (drama, slice of life, tragedy, fantasy). The story may look slow but each episode is well thought out and provides insights on the main characters of the anime. Each episode has a message or a lesson for Natsume, and viewers in my opinion; most of them are common knowledge, but they serve as a reminder to the people who watch the series.
                              A friend introduced and urged me to watch this anime. I am always interested in stuff associated with youkai so I knew I had to give this a shot. This is probably the most light hearted anime I've watched so far, especially the ending song is just soooooo soothing. The anime have a episode by episode plot so you don't have to complete the whole series in one day. A calm and peaceful anime with a hint of humour in it. I wouldn't say it was action packed.           "

"Twenty-two-year-old college dropout Tatsuhiro Satou has been a hikikomori for almost four years now. In his isolation, he has come to believe in many obscure conspiracy theories, but there is one in particular which he holds unshakable faith in: the theory that the evil conspirator behind his shut-in NEET (Not in Employment, Education or Training) status is the Nihon Hikikomori Kyokai (NHK)—an evil and secret organization dedicated to fostering the spread of hikikomori culture.

NHK ni Youkoso! is a psychological dramedy that follows Tatsuhiro as he strives to escape from the NHK's wicked machinations and the disease of self-wrought isolation, while struggling to even just leave his apartment and find a job. His unexpected encounter with the mysterious Misaki Nakahara might signal a reversal of fortune for Tatsuhiro, but with this meeting comes the inevitable cost of having to face his greatest fear—society.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.33,8,205,204,553114,21393,"                              Welcome to the N.H.K. is the story of a 22-year-old hikikomori/NEET named Satou Tatsuhiro.
                                   Are you new to anime? Or are you a veteran? Well, with ""NHK ni Youkoso!"" it doesn't matter! This is one of those anime that you can easily get through, want more, think about it's message and wonder how such a masterpiece isn't more popular. Not only does this anime entertain it's audience with a wonderful story, a variety of characters, great sound affects and great music, but it also teaches the viewer about the difficulties of social anxiety and psychological disorders. There are only a handful of anime out there that handle such delicate subjects and shower them in          
                              First, let me say that I saw this entire show in a period of 3 days. So, that in itself says something about how enjoyable it was. If I wasn't having a good time watching it, then I wouldn't have bothered doing 12 episodes in one day. :)
                              I was expecting a dark Satoshi Kon style satire on hikikomorism; the dehabilitating affects of media as represented by the NHK broadcasting company and post millennium conspiracy theories, but instead this anime merely uses hikkomorism as a backdrop for melodramatic relationship angst and blues.
                              Welcome to the world of mental disorders, in which everything looks colorful yet mundane. It is a world that lets affected people transcend the borders of the ordinary by allowing them to impose their very own interpretation of the world upon the circumstances that surround them. This way, people learn to cope with their sometimes unpromising situations by making use of their powerful minds alone.
                              I can honestly say that I've never been so happy to be done with a series. This show is barely watchable, and it all stems from the main character.
                              There exists something rare in this medium. In fact, its so rare, that only a handful of titles have managed to do this and still make the anime work. This trait is called realistic chemistry of characters. In a fictional work, it's virtually impossible to create relations so genuine, that it is almost frightening to experience when you do so. You are aware that what you're witnessing is made-up, but can't help comparing the characters' life to yours, as well as the struggles they encounter.
                              Every now and then you come across those shows that just strike you with a sort of emotional response you rarely get elsewhere. It's not a directly tragic response, it's more a gentle, melancholy feeling - a poignant way of portraying reality for what it is - not a happy optimistic place, not a place where you're guaranteed a bright future, but a harsh place that some people find so hard to deal with they shut themselves away from it instead.
                              NHK ni Youkoso is an anime based off a novel and manga of the same name by Tatsuhiko Takimoto. It is a story about a hikikomori and NEET (Not currently engaged in Employment, Education or Training) named Tatsuhiro Sat&#333; who struggles with who he is and just getting through daily life.
                              Welcome to the NHK is a Seinen, Psychological, Comedy, Drama about a guy who has become a hikikomori (someone who has shut themselves away from society) and is living his life believing in conspiracies. Then his life is suddenly turned around when some girl decides to cure him of his hikikomori ways.
                              Welcome to the NHK has become my go-to when I want to recommend someone a series (mostly to a male audience I would say, though.) It's got a truly great mix of laughs, cringes, tears, light romance, stress, and all manner of feels. The series ultimately sums up all of the ways a modern man could be truly pathetic, and presents it in a way that makes us all contemplate, laugh at, and root for ourselves.
                              Here it is, people. This is no hyperbole. NHK is the worst anime of all time. It is one of the worst pieces of media you can conjure. A reality show about the Kardashians must be better than this. Pathetic YouTube parodies are better than this. In order to make something worse than this, you’ll need to let Ian Watkins brag about his pedophilia in the Lostprophets album that was never made.
                              I have long heard that &ldquo;Welcome to the NHK!&rdquo; (which I will call WttNHK for short) is a fairly good anime with strong comedic elements. This is an understatement. What lies beneath the superficial surface that WttNHK posits itself to enclose are a myriad of thematics pertaining to human interaction, societal repression, and the core motivations behind human behaviour. Let us explore:
                              Welcome to the NHK (NHK ni Youkouso), first broadcast in 2006, is a fantastic series that mockingly celebrates deviant cultures versus their &ldquo;normal&rdquo; counterparts in modern Japan. This bizarre celebration is presented through a narrative focusing primarily on the protagonist Sato Tatsuhiro, those around him, and the struggles they face&mdash;at the center of which is Sato&rsquo;s concerning status of hikkikomori.

At the same time in France, a girl is born in the family of the Commander of the Royal Guards. Upset at not having a male heir, her father decides to raise her as a man and names the girl Oscar. Oscar is trained from a young age to become the leader of the Royal Guards, but she is yet to discern that the will of the queen sometimes does not equal the good of the people.

Based on the critically acclaimed manga by Riyoko Ikeda, Rose of Versailles depicts the fateful meeting of Marie Antoinette and Oscar, which is bound to influence history and change the life of the people facing the French Revolution as the clock ticks toward the end of the French royalty.

                              After putting this off for eons, I've finally decided to review Rose of Versailles. This is an anime that almost everyone has heard of, but fewer people have actually seen. In terms of popularity, Rose of Versailles isn't ranked in the top 1,800. I've yet to convince any of my offline buddies to check this one out because when you recommend this anime to people you're usually met with stuff like ""It's so OLD though!"" Or sometimes you might hear ""Isn't that one of those elitist series? Doesn't that mean it's going to be super boring and pretentious?"" These attitudes are unfortunate because I think          
                              Wow, what a story. I can't believe I haven't watched this anime until now. No, I can't believe what I just watched. I'd always thought that the forbidden love romance between Romeo and Juliet was tragic... I'd always thought that Shingeki no Kyojin was epic. I'd always thought that stories like Clannad and AnoHana were masterpieces. But wow, Rose of Versailles puts all of these shows to shame. Who knew that an anime,  which some people (idiots) call ""cartoons"", could portray such a realistic, romantic, tragic, and captivating historical story about the events leading up to the french revolution - 1700s. Rose of Versailles          
                              It’s the eve of the 18th century and France is flailing between hubris and chaos.
                              Story
                              It's without hesitation that I'd consider Rose of Versailles to be the definitive masterpiece of the shoujo genre. Clearly defined, ambitious, and relentless, it accurately dramatizes the period of instability leading up and into the French Revolution, all the while developing memorable and unique characters. Thanks to this grace, it has had an influence on anime and manga to this day. 
                              The Rose of Versailles is an old school anime. It aired from 1979-1980 and was based off of a manga from the early 70s. It was brought to us by TMS, the same studio behind the mediocre Magic Knight Rayearth, the excellent Glass no Kamen & the decent enough Kousetsu Hyaku Monogatari. Is this one a classic worth revisiting? Let's find out. 
                              Before you read this I will ask of you to not judge it solely on the high ratings. I feel like I have explained the reasons for giving them quite well. Please in your rating, let me know the way to improve on it and I will promptly do so. The high animation rating is based on what could be accomplished at the time the anime was made as I realise that it would be sub-standard if it were made nowadays.
                              If you combined certain elements of Revolutionary Girl Utena with the novel Les Miserables by Victor Hugo, you'd get Rose of Versailles.
                              As a general rule, I'm not into shoujos - joseis yes, but not shoujos. ""Rose of Versailles"" is a shoujo.
                              Critic’s Log – July 14, 2015. Review #95: The Rose of Versailles
                              Rose of Versailles is a typical shoujo romance set not long before and during French Revolution. It executes both badly. There are gonna be spoilers here.
                              70’s. Somehow, the ‘70’s-ness made this show better. The ridiculous sound effects crack me up every time, and that's good because otherwise the show might just be too heavy. The animation is at times downright shabby by our standards, however what do you expect, some three decades later? To enjoy this show, you have to accept that it has a lot of faults, and that despite that it entertains quite strongly. 
                              The Rose of Versailles tells the events leading up to the French Revolution with an added twist - shaping its events around the struggles of two fictional characters, Oscar Francois de Jarjeyes and André Grandier. It's interesting because even though these characters never actually existed, the author managed to interweave their stories with real historical figures like Marie Antoinette and Hans Axel von Fersen. In fact, the narratives pushed in these real historical events make it seem like Oscar and Andre were real people involved. It's really amazing how the author managed to add in fictional characters to these events without creating plot holes that

                              Evangelion is widely considered one of the most influential anime created in the 1990's, if not of all time. It is extremely well known for it's brave attempts to turn the mecha genre on it's head, it's deep character development, and it's unorthodox storyline. Created by acclaimed studio Gainax, and written by both praised (and sometimes hated) writer Hideaki Anno, Evangelion has been called a masterpiece by anime fans. Does it deserve this praise.
                              Mod Edit: This review may contain spoilers.
                              Hugely experimental and thankfully unique, Evangelion is a roaring failure.
                              Neon Genesis Evangelion is probably familiar to most of you. It's a well-known series from Gainax written by Anno Hideaki. It's also an anime I never got all the way through before this point. I tried several years before I wrote my first review when I was watching a bunch of anime because they had Hayashibara Megumi. I got through Nuku Nuku, Blue Seed, Saber Marionette, the Slayers, Love Hina, Bakuretsu Hunters and some others. Evangelion was the only series I couldn't get through. The characters annoyed me more than any cast I'd ever seen and the story was pants. In the end I got          
                              Neon Genesis Evangelion has been known to divide audiences. And despite its love for giant robot battles and generous use of fan service, Neon Genesis Evangelion is unarguably one... of the most influential sagas in modern anime. In the history of anime no series has sparked more debate than Evangelion. For every viewer who's enthralled by its mix of classic anime action, convoluted philosophy, psychological angst, and religious imagery, there's another who finds it pretentious and ponderous.
                              One of my absolute favorite things about this anime is how they have implemented lots of references to old religious symbols and characters; and how it's all done. They make the series into something more by doing this; it gives it a unique feel that I still haven't seen in other series. 
                              I realize that I'm likely painting a target on my face with this one, but here goes. Please read to the end, as my recommendation may surprise.
                              Overview:
                              Overhype, thy name is Evangelion.
                              Neon Genesis Evangelion is perhaps the most popular anime of all time, trumping the majority of anime franchises, and is often considered to be the best anime of all time. Needless to say, it isn't. Not even close. Although it certainly had the potential to be, it just didn't live up to it. Which isn't to say Evangelion is bad, no. Evangelion is actually very good in many, many ways. The problem is, it counteracts this by having some horrible problem in another way.
                              This was a rather tricky programme to review. Great pains were taken to avoid spoilers so if you're a fan of Eva, please don't take umbrage with me for not going in-depth with certain areas. If you happen to dislike Eva or feel that it's overrated, I'd still encourage you to read through this entire review. Feedback is greatly appreciated, as always. On another note, this review will NOT cover Evangelion's religious symbolism at all. I tried to in earlier drafts of this review, but they just made the review much longer and more tedious than they needed to be.
                              Neon Genesis Evangelion is one of the most well known anime of the 1990s. Whether someone recommended it to you or you happened to read the name in passing, Evangelion is a name that’s impossible to escape if you’re a part of the anime community. However, with its fame also comes controversy. The show has got to be one of the most divisive anime ever made. Many love it and consider it to be one of the greatest anime to come out of the 1990s and others consider it to be a pretentious mess with irritating characters. Well based on the score I’m pretty sure          
                              Neon Genesis Evangelion.

                              [Spoiler Warning]
                              Having read the light novel, No Game No Life Zero was everything i expected it to be. You shouldn't be watching this movie with similar expectations to the series in mind mainly because the setting of both stories in the anime and the movie are worlds apart (hah see what I did there). One important thing to keep in mind is despite the movie's main purpose being to explain the origins of the world of Disboard(current NGNL world), the story is focused on the development of a romance between the two MCs and their efforts to change the world.
                              *Royalty-free fanfare*
                              As someone who loves anime, spending my summer in japan to visit my japanese cousins was pretty lucky. No Game No Life:Zero is a must watch for anyone who has watched the original television series.
                              We often remember No Game No Life as that one anime with pink gradients and excessively bright color-schemes. When this district art-style suddenly changes, the atmosphere and our expectations for what’s to come change along with it. I’m sure you all remember how impactful the first 9 minutes of episode 9 were, with its complete grayscale with lack of context. No Game No Life: Zero, in short, gives you a similar feel through a ninety-minute emotional roller-coaster, completely remaking its original Gaming/Comedy genre into something more touching, but none the less still very entertaining.
                              ***EDIT!!! I've now seen the film twice. In my second viewing I was able to pretty much assure what I put down in this review originally was pretty close to my feelings towards the film. However there is a change to the “characters” category. My new thoughts will be listed under the original paragraph.***
                              Remember No Game No Life? That somewhat entertaining anime about 2 teens Isekai'd into some fantasy land and play games as well as get into harem shenanigans. Fair enough, nothing groundbreaking, but nothing offensive too (except for Stephanie Dola, she needs to be hung). So imagine my surprise when it's 4 years later and they decide to make a movie prequel that takes a darker tone and is considerably more serious. I bought a ticket (because Mary and The Witch's Flower wasn't playing anymore), got my popcorn (from a dollar store) and got comfy. Does Zero hold up to the rest of the series?
                              l would like to say no game no life: zero have different plot than no game no life. It has more darker world and story but beyond the scope of movie it is the part of whole story. And the more you dig in the story , the more you get enjoy. And details like Tet's appearance and clothes or the fact Disboard (the name of the world in no game no life) is actually a game. These are outstanding and stylish. The movie is being told by Tet like a myth. But in the middle of movie there is no story anymore for audience.          
                               ----~No Game No Life: Zero (ノーゲーム・ノーライフ ゼロ)~----
                              First review here. I don't tend write long elegant reviews but here's just a dump of information.
                              I TOTALLY DIDN'T EXPECT WHAT I'M ABOUT TO WATCH HAS THIS POWERFUL IMPACT!
                              This is an exceptional anime movie. Honestly, if you're putting this off because it wont feature the two main characters from the original, don't do that to yourself. This ties into the other universe phenomenally.
                              From what i read in the novel ; 
                              No Game No Life Zero is a prequel to the events to the anime, focusing on Riku and his robotic companion Shuvi. That's pretty much all you need to know for this particular review."
"Shinichi Chiaki is a first class musician whose dream is to play among the elites in Europe. Coming from a distinguished family, he is an infamous perfectionist—not only is he highly critical of himself, but of others as well. The only thing stopping Shinichi from leaving for Europe is his fear of flying. As a result, he's grounded in Japan.

During his fourth year at Japan's top music university, Shinichi happens to meet Megumi Noda or, as she refers to herself, Nodame. On the surface, she seems to be an unkempt girl with no direction in life. However, when Shinichi hears Nodame play the piano for the first time, he is in awe of the kind of music she creates. Nevertheless, Shinichi is dismayed to discover that Nodame is his neighbor, and worse, she ends up falling head over heels in love with him.

                              I've seen my fair share of music anime, but this is the first time the musical genre has been my first love: classical music.
                              Personally, I think Nodame Cantabile is in a league by itself when it comes to chemistry between characters.
                              What can I say about Nodame Cantobile? It was one of those anime that you can\'t help but enjoy. It managed to tell a fun story in which each of the characters try to accomplish what they want out of life with a careful mix of humor and drama.
                              Introduction
                              Nodame Cantabile is strange in some regards. It has a good story, full of excellent music, but the transition into the anime medium is a rocky and half-hearted one.
                              ~!~ WARNING: Some spoilers may be present ~!~
                              ""Where words leave off, music begins.""
                              Nodame.  She just captured my heart entirely and left me glowing inside and out.
                              A quite funny argument you might find occasionally in defense of a work is the saying “you watched it wrong”, implying that any criticism the person might have to the series in question comes from having watched it with the wrong mindset. While I find particularly silly that one would primarily assume such case about someone else’s opinion when facing criticism to a beloved work, since it’s a very pretentious attitude, it doesn’t seem unlikely that a circumstance like that can happen. That was the issue I faced when I began watching Nodame Cantabile, an anime I started with the expectation of being a straight          
                              Pros
                              If Nodame wasn't in the show I would have loved it however her character was annoying and I either wanted to shoot her or shoot myself. If I ever meet someone with such a character in real life, that's exactly what would happen. I can't stand Nodame. The rest of the show was good, even close to excellent. The music was wonderful, the art was good, and the rest of the characters were funny and held certain interests. Nodame killed all hope of me ever enjoying this show.          
                              I have to admit, I was very worried about this. I ended up putting off watching it for two weeks, even. It's all because I know absolutely nothing about music, especially the classics. If it sounds good, I'll listen to it. Doesn't matter to me what the instruments are or how long it took to perfect. 
                              Nodame Cantibile is a lighthearted and comedic anime about one of my favorite hobbies, music.  At first I was hesitant to explore the series due to my lack of appreciation for the classical genre, but what I found in Nodame Cantibile was more than just music.  This was a coming of age story of sorts, with a feel good plot line and characters full of passion, all battling their own internal struggles to be better musicians.  It’s definitely a nice change of pace and a must see for any slice of life fan, or enthusiast of music in general.
                              Nodame Cantabile is an anime I truly love, but my honest opinion is it does not deserve a 10/10 despite how enjoyable it was."

However, not only does Irma provide little information, she asks Violet to write based on her own feelings. Despite Violet's numerous attempts, Irma finds every version of the letter inadequate.

Violet consults her colleagues, and they help her out by writing love letters of their own. Yet even those are rejected by the opera singer.

                              To put it simply. This is a much better ending than the original. I felt the action and how fast everything seemed just didn't fit the rest of the show. But thankfully with this, we got a much more natural and satisfying ending for such a great show.
                              ""Can I put 'love' to words, when I don't know what 'love' is?""
                              Stick to the formula. Get the same results. 
                              Violet Evergarden is a beautiful story about loving others and its consequences. Love indeed touches people and their hearts like anything else. If there is one anime, one story that can pull off ""love"" in a virtual storyline - it shall be Violet Evergarden.
                              I want to start by saying that this might contain a little spoiler so please keep that in mind.
                              Let me begin by saying that I watched the main ""Violet Evergarden"" show and actually liked it and gave it an 8. In my review for the main show I mentioned that Violet's episodes are mostly stand-alone, each with its own story and very loosely connected. It is not surprising then that the OVA is basically a canon episode and would probably be indistinguishable from the others if you watched it without knowing it's the OVA.
                              With this special episode Violet Evergarden proves to us once again how the power of words can change the world around a person and how hard it is to find the perfect words for the dear ones. The  timeline of the story is set between episode 4 and 5 and the focus is on a opera singer who is trying to convey her feelings of love for the dear one through her acting and singing. Violet as you know will try do to her best to help her but now she is in a pinch and that is what makes this special worth watching,          
                              “Violet Evergarden: Kitto ""Koi"" wo Shiru Hi ga Kuru no Darou” is an OVA that doesn't differ from the traditional content the normal episodes of the parent series deliver, it makes it pretty odd to see it released as a standalone piece of animation.
                              This was a great OVA, and I'm happy for this extra little story. It was really heartwarming, the story was beautiful.
                              Surprisingly enough, I liked this short OVA more than the Gaiden Eternity movie. I felt like this episode fleshed out the characters a lot better, describing the effects of the war on so many ordinary people, not just those who worked in the military. The war may have ended, but their hearts were frozen in time and I understand how it must be so difficult to accept progress, both emotionally and in terms of societal development. I really enjoyed how this elaboration of the setting and collective mindset supported Violet's own situation, and how this side story pushed her to understand what ""love"" and ""moving          
                              After watching all aired seasons and movies I confirm I  am in love with this series.  its is super warm and and it touches your soul, it indeed conveys the human feelings to the audience and makes you feel as if you are there with them inside the anime itself.
                              For context, I give the main show a 10. I really love Violet Evergarden, and I'm really looking forward to the film. It's great that they released an unaired episode from the show as an OVA later on.
                              This OVA lives up to the whole series. same quality of art, sound.. and brings one more emotional and well written story that in just a few minutes makes us empathize with the characters and their situation. The soundtrack fits perfectly in the narrative and makes us live the story as a awaken dream. 
                              Sometimes, a little context is important when it comes to appreciating a film."

                              Holy hot damn, this anime just keeps surprising me. I'll tell you what, the end of this season had me so stressed that my heart was beating as though I'd just run the mile. I'm gonna try to keep this review short because my review of the first season was pretty through in explaining why this anime is so good, but I'm gonna hit some of the points that got better for me this season or things I noticed more.
                              Starting this series was an impulsive decision while I was on a sports anime binge. I don’t regret it at all. Even though I’ve never watched a real baseball game and the sport is virtually non-existent in my country, I quickly grew to like it.
                              The 2nd season for Diamond no Ace keeps the hope of winning a ticket to national tournament alive!
                                Since  you came to read the reviews of the 2nd season i assume you ve already seen the 1st. (if not, well you are a bit of an oddball)
                              Following this series for two years, left me devastated when I knew my Monday will go on without a new episode of this series.
                              This is my first time to write a fullest review,really I've been write the same review abuout before.but,I thought previous most contents wrong grammar so I deleted it.why I write first for this? it causes most so wonderous and unforgottable story.I ever thought that so difficult and boring to playing baseball.nevertheless,my view got changed while I completed it.so,don't you'd be missing out on one of the best sports anime here.
                              Comparing to season 1, this season has improved a whole lot. Sawamura finally became useful. If you like Miyuki then this is the season where he shines the most. There were some epic moments here and there as well as touching moments. What I do not enjoy however, is the episode where Seido had to compete against a school with many bulky school member. I know for a fact that the author is trying to make it as a challenge that Seido had to overcome, however, it made it seem like the author is encouraging violence in sports. I can elaborate more but it can          
                              Dimaond no ace> you must watch this anime ! you will love it if you love genre sport ,the main character sawamura eijun it's person who cheerful and never give up, althoung i love the second character furuya ^^""
                              ⠀⠀So of course I loved season two of DNA it's my 3rd favorite sport anime! And season 2 just made everything better, with Seido getting they're ticket to Nationals!

                              History: 8.5
                              This was my first venture into the baseball sports anime genre. I have never watched a single baseball game in my life and was never intrested in one until I watched Diamond no Ace. I expected it to some boring anime of a team trying to play baseball as hard as they can. But sometime after that Diamond no Ace was approved for 52 episodes for its first season and the it was being produced by Madhouse. So I thought i would give it a try and to my surprise Diamond no Ace is now one of my all-time favourite shows.
                              This is my first time to write a review because I truly think that this anime deserves way more praise than it currently receives. In my circle of friends, I'm the only one who watched this anime because of the fact that the sport featured in this anime - baseball, is boring. But don't let that stop you since you'd be missing out on one of the best sports anime out there.
                              I was quite excited to find that Diamond no Ace was getting a second season basically straight after it finished. Although the first few episodes were recaps, I found this sequel on-par with, or maybe even better than, the first season."

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.32,8,215,945,158886,3827,"                              Reading the manga, a lot of stuff bugged me. Mostly how quickly the storyline just moved on. The characters and relationship didn't get time to properly develop or even be introduced well. The idea of this story was cute, but the way it was told turned the manga pretty shitty. However, in the movie they changed all of that. The creators stretched out all of the ""soon-to-be-over"" scenes, and ended up spending their time very well. This way it was easier for me to really get to know the characters, and for their relationship to build. They also managed to not stretch anything too far.          
                              DO NOT WATCH THIS
                              You have no idea how long I've been waiting for this. I've been familiar with the source material for more than a couple of years and have read it over and again multiple times. I've even listened to the Drama CD more times than I would probably ever confess to. 
                              (Intro is spoilers sorry even then it doesn't take away enjoyment.)
                              Well, you can definitely say that Doukyuusei is aesthetically pleasing. The colours used for backgrounds are generally muted, but the characters are vivid. Expressions are adorably drawn and very clear through a distinct art style.
                              I was really pumped when I heard there was a decent, cute BL anime movie coming out. I was a little disappointed. Not because it was bad, because by any means it's a decent flick, but because it was only merely okay.
                              I was really excited about this anime. I heard great things about it, and having been monumentally disappointed with the BL genre in general, I thought that FINALLY a gem had been made.
                              I do not enjoy this movie as much as other people do, just because I found the pacing to be too quick. If this were episodes, I would probably enjoy it more than I do. 
                              Very much enjoyed watching! A very light yet touching watch, a feel good movie for people who seek a little bit of youth romance. Just enough fluffy, chummy, lovey-dovey stuff to compliment the story. 
                              The build up of the story is quite simple, but is done in a clever way. The plot is compelling and sweet, and it doesn't drag on for longer than it has to.
                              This is the type of movie you watch when you want to put a smile on your face! It's very sweet and all around a very pleasant movie to watch! The animation looked great (when the characters would run on screen they did look slightly wonky but that's fine) and the backgrounds were all very nicely done. The characters I really enjoyed. Also if you already watched the movie.. did you think it was weird how that teacher guy kissed the student and then nothing ever happened after that?? I thought that was kind of odd! I mean the teacher never got in trouble and          
                              To be honest i never actually thought i would like this when my friend recommended this to me as I was never really into the yaoi and romance genre. But I was wrong.
                              Doukyuusei is aesthetically pleasing, though there were many things that confused or upset me.
                              Well I have to say that this was a rather interesting movie, but I need to point out a major flaw. This was simply found rushed to me, as I feel like there was simply not enough time, in that hour to really tell the story. Unlike the manga, there is no real development of their relationship, nor other feelings like jealousy are shown, like it has been in the manga. It's a bit of a shame, since I felt like that is what really made the manga what it is, and it could have been easily incorporated into the movie too. Maybe if this          
                              A very good movie to watch on a summer day. It's light, with a little bit of pain. The art is wonderful. I actually never read the manga of this movie, because I don't like to read things that make me sad, and I knew this story will most probably make me cry. But in the movie it was actually what added the deeper layer to it. It's a very simple movie, and watching it definitely made me think of ""youth"". Also a note that I believe is important: there are no homophobic slurs in this film. This film is about love between two people,          "
"Tightly clutching his Gibson guitar, Mafuyu Satou steps out of his dark apartment to begin another day of his high school life. While taking a nap in a quiet spot on the gymnasium staircase, he has a chance encounter with fellow student Ritsuka Uenoyama, who berates him for letting his guitar's strings rust and break. Noticing Uenoyama's knowledge of the instrument, Satou pleads for him to fix it and to teach him how to play. Uenoyama eventually agrees and invites him to sit in on a jam session with his two band mates: bassist Haruki Nakayama and drummer Akihiko Kaji.

Satou's voice is strikingly beautiful, filling Uenoyama with the determination to make Satou the lead singer of the band. Though reticent at first, Satou takes the offer after an emotional meeting with an old friend. With the support of his new friends, Satou must not only learn how to play guitar, but also come to terms with the mysterious circumstances that led him to be its owner.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.32,8,216,552,267264,9477,"                              Given strikes the rare balance of being openly gay - none of that maybe he is, maybe he isn’t crap - while not indulging in over the top eroticism to pander to a niche viewership. This is a vanilla, realistic, down to earth romance that can be watched by anyone open minded to love that exceeds conventional desire. 
                              As Crunchyroll states it: ""Why You Should Rock Out With Given, The Best Summer Anime You're NOT Watching"" AND YOU SHOULD WATCH IT, regardless if you're a fan of Shounen Ai (or as we otakus like to call it BL) or not. Heck, it's not even about if you're a straight male or female casually watching BL. It's just SIMPLY PHENOMENAL in every degree.
                              ""Whatever you left behind became my everything and life."" - Unknown person
                              (EDIT PART) This week I found out that Given is a Haikyu! DJ so I take out everything I said before because you can see the author obscenely stole the character's design and personality.
                              I am absolutely baffled to see the amount of positive reviews written for this series, I seriously can't tell if the score is just inflated due to the little amount of viewers this series has received or I just don't understand fujoshis in general. This series has so many major flaws and barely any of the reviews cover what makes this show so insufferably dull and uninteresting.
                              Given is 2019’s dark horse. It’s a title that has been slept on for its subject matter instead of appreciated for its prowess. Unlike Bloom Into You which received a major backing over the course of its run, Given seems to have received little fanfare within the community despite the praise most viewers have for it. I wouldn’t call it amazing, but it certainly does resonate, much like a good tune.
                              Shounen ai isn't something that most anime fans find comfortable watching. Not that it makes these viewers necessarily homophobic, but considering the genre's abysmal record of featuring BL containing romanticized sexual assault (I'm looking at you Junjou Romantica) to portray romance between men—on top of subpar writing and cringe-worthy dialogues, it's understandable that viewers would rather avoid it.
                              “Everything that you left behind became my everything.”
                              I'm having a hard time figuring out what to start this review with, simply because even days after its conclusion I still have so many thoughts and feelings swirling around about it. Perhaps saying ""nevermind the genre categories"" is a good start. Sure, they give clues as to what to expect, but expectations are dangerous. Many of those words that describe genre have way too many negative connotations, which inevitably influence one's decision to watch or avoid a certain anime. And even without those connotations, I'm sure ""shounen ai"" is something many people avoid on principle. Well, here's a great reason why you should not.          
                              Now that I've finished the series I have to say Given is perhaps one of my favorite Shonen-ai anime adaptions of all time, it was just perfect right down to the music which was absolutely breathtaking, not many Shonen-ai or Yaoi shows can do that. 
                              “It all started with that chord I played. I had no idea that I was strumming hard on his heartstrings with my own fingers.”
                              Yeah once again I'm here and ready to kind of maybe sort of share what I think
                              A soft, dappled light pools in the corner of a stairway, warm and nostalgic like a home you never realized you were missing. A boy sleeps in that light, a guitar clutched to his chest. From a glance, he seems adrift, like a lost rowboat bobbing on a dark, cloudy ocean. For a moment, all is silent and still. It might as well be a framed photograph.
                              This was a really sweet and touching anime about the development of a relationship between two guys, one of them overcoming past traumas, while the other is trying to rekindle his passion for music. Both of them need one another (not in the emotional-dependency, unhealthy kind of way), but in a way that makes them both stronger and better people when they're together. 
                              Normally, I wouldn't have given two shits about ""Given"", not because I'm a homophobe, mostly because I'm not that into romance in general. I like romance, but with something else there to make it a little more interesting. "
"Fourteen-year-old Yukio ""Koyuki"" Tanaka is a dispirited young boy with no goals in life. However, this all changes when Koyuki saves a strange-looking dog named Beck from being harassed by a group of local kids. The dog's owner, 16-year-old Ryuusuke ""Ray"" Minami, is an emerging guitarist and the former member of a popular rock band. 

After Koyuki meets Ray again in a diner, the older boy leads him to his former band's meeting place and dazzles Koyuki with his amazing guitar skills. Slowly becoming interested in the glamour of western rock culture, Koyuki decides to start playing the guitar while helping Ray achieve his dream of leading the ultimate rock band. Together with Ray's younger sister Maho and a few other members, the two boys launch their career into the world of rock by forming a band called BECK. Beck follows the group's struggles and successes as they spread their fame across Japan.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.31,8,217,568,258139,7109,"                              First of all, it is much better than expected. The storyline was so interesting and wonderfully executed, that I even disregarded the sub par drawing style . I like the idea of a band struggling to make it big not only in Japan, but as well as in America.
                              In a medium where the music genre is scarce but dominated by Japanese Pop with a few classical and traditional Japanese music stories in between. We do get some black sheep like Beck everyone once in a while that indeed opens a window of fresh air. 
                              I Loved this show, but my rating is coming with a bias, because i basically just watched my life in an anime. I am a musician who has had many bands playing clubs and an arena, so this show was a great watch.
                              Beck tells the story of a young high school student who picks up a guitar and begins a journey of growth, music, and friendship within a rock band.
                              I can honestly say that I have never seen another anime like BECK: Mongolian Chop Squad. Slice-of-life anime is common, of course, but usually it’s that rosy Azumanga Daioh view of high school that resembles real life only in place and time, like a Disney sitcom. The best way to describe this show is that it’s an animated independent film. Except for the patchwork dog and an only slightly far-fetched mobster side-plot near the show’s climax, the series feels grounded not in picturesque reality like a lot of high school slice-of-life, but in the persistently disappointing ennui of real high school life, and the grit          

                              Honestly, I wasn't looking forward to this show. I saw it at a pawn shop for a very cheap price so I went ahead to give a chance. Even after having a friend telling me it pretty much sucks. I must say that it was a whole lot better than I expected. It certainly isn't my favourite but there is something special about it. 
                              Series about young boys searching for themselves and their place in life are not rare by any stretch of the imagination, but ones that really grasp the viewer and provide something more than a simple coming of age story are astoundingly rare. Beck takes the coming of age story and introduces two characteristics which help to distinguish it greatly from other series of its kind: a deep immersion in the world of underground rock, and a deep involvement with its subject matter, which lends emotional weight and a sense of honesty to a tired premise.
                              I never saw a music theme manga or anime until I watched K-On!. Since then, I been hooked to the max for anime like that. I watched some like it and some not like it, but this anime is much more than ""Just like K-ON!"" Its own feel to it, Its uniqueness that called out to me. 
                              Beck is an anime that I have deep respect for since I am a musician myself. This show really does create a sense of what being a rock musician would really be about and it does have some great moments that make this show memorable. Add that to its good music, and spectacular voice acting and characters, Beck comes off as a fantastic show. However, Beck although very good in its ideas, expression, humor, characters, and just overall awesomeness as an anime also makes some aggravating blunders that bother me to no end. Without these blunders or issues, I feel that this anime could have          
                              I am somewhat biased towards this show in a positive way, considering I am a big fan of rock music and I first viewed it when I was not much older than the main character (around 15 or 16). Like Koyuki, I was young, impressionable, and troubled, so that's a major factor into why I love it so much.
                              Oh man what a journey this anime was! I'm sort of mad that I had it on my PTW list for so long, and I'll tell you why. Beck is one of those special anime that reels you in with its relatable characters, and intriguing storyline. I'm really glad that I can put this on my list as my 100th completed anime. Nevertheless, the review:
                              “… RJ label can only produce “feel good” pop tunes, “escapist” music that says everything is alright which just paralyzes people’s consciousness and steals their ability to solve problems that they face in their everyday lives.” – Wao Sato on pop music, Ep 20.
                              This is my review on the anime Beck.

"Noah's Ark—the latest in VR technology and a milestone of human innovation—is set for a showcase to Japan's privileged children. They have the honour of beginning a new revolution in gaming; however, their carefree fun is cut short when a company employee is found murdered, with his dying message pointing to a clue hidden within the Ark.

Along with the Detective Boys and Ran Mouri, Conan Edogawa enters Noah's Ark to solve this mystery and ensure the perpetrator is caught. But once they're inside the Ark, it takes on a mind of its own, imprisoning them and the children within its worlds. To escape and bring the murderer to justice, Conan and company must navigate a simulated 19th century London and track down the infamous Jack the Ripper—with the lives of 50 innocent children depending on them.

                              Story: 10
                              From Detective Conan Movies 1 to 15, I like this one the most. The virtual reality concept is interesting and it's set in London which is a nice change. Also includes Jack the Ripper and Sherlock Holmes which made it more interesting. 
                              Although it's taking place inside a VR game, I would have expected quite a bit of mystery from a Detective Conan movie set in the era of Sherlock Holmes. Even more since said game is about investigating the case of Jack the Ripper, one of the great unresolved real-life murder mysteries. But what do we get instead? Conan first goes to Holmes' place (who is currently absent due to his investigation of the Baskerville case), then goes to meet Moriarty, has him kinda summon the culprit, and off we go to the showdown. Bah. Holmes appearing literally out of thin air on the train didn't          
                              This...was...amazing! I have seen a lot of ""Conan"" stories by now and I enjoy them in general. However, they usually feel like ""Here's another somewhat interesting case"" and individual stories often don't stand out.
                              This movie used to be one of my least favorites in the series. Back then, I found it to be weird and somewhat contrived. I understand that this statement may displease some fans. After all, Detective Conan: The Phantom of Baker Street is unarguably a very popular movie among them all and is often considered the best one in the whole series. To this day, I still don't necessarily agree with these opinions. That said, I can finally see why it is that people love this movie so much and why it is still worth recommending to this day.
                              The Phantom of Baker Street has always been one of my favourite Detective Conan movies. I like its characters and story."
"When Kazuma Satou died, he was given two choices: pass on to heaven or be revived in a fantasy world. After choosing the new world, the goddess Aqua tasked him with defeating the Demon King, and let him choose any weapon to aid him. Unfortunately, Kazuma chose to bring Aqua herself and has regretted the decision ever since then.

Not only is he stuck with a useless deity turned party archpriest, the pair also has to make enough money for living expenses. To add to their problems, their group continued to grow as more problematic adventurers joined their ranks. Their token spellcaster, Megumin, is an explosion magic specialist who can only cast one spell once per day and refuses to learn anything else. There is also their stalwart crusader, Lalatina ""Darkness"" Dustiness Ford, a helpless masochist who makes Kazuma look pure in comparison.

Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo! 2 continues to follow Kazuma and the rest of his party through countless more adventures as they struggle to earn money and have to deal with one another's problematic personalities. However, things rarely go as planned, and they are often sidetracked by their own idiotic tendencies.

                              In the end of Season 1, I thought the story was actually going to go somewhere. But as soon as I was halfway through season 2, I realized nothing really happened to further the story. I thought season 1 to have some potential so I came into season 2 with some expectations. I was pretty disappointed to be honest. 
                              Consistency is hard to find in comedy. Many shows can be funny some of the time, but few can build off their initial success to keep an audience engaged for the long haul. Konosuba avoids the common pitfalls found in its genre by building off the success of season 1, getting even crazier in its lampooning of trapped in another world tropes and continuing to satirize its characters who find creative ways to fail at life.
                              And now, I, the contrarian buzzkill present to you, Kono2ba: A middling, even less funny, and overall lower quality product that actually wants to be taken seriously at times. It fails by its predecessor's standards and it makes me feel like Kazuma. I'll grab the rotten tomatoes...
                              TL;DR: Whether you love comedy or satire, maybe in the mood for some ecchi memes to quench your kinky desires. KonoSuba is your go to parody to complete all your guilty pleasures! 
                              It’s back. 10 episodes of comedic fantasy with Kazuma and the gang. If you’re got a little kid lurking somewhere inside of you, then Konosuba Season 2 is here to please. If you’re familiar with the first season, then expect all the humor to return in full fold. It’s bright. It’s colorful. The plot sounds like it could have been written by someone who was half drunk. But make no mistake about it…Konosuba Season 2 is here again to entertain.
                              The first season of Konosuba was a surprise hit because it had great character interactions, well done comedy, good consistent visuals and a good soundtrack.
                              [Score : 5.0/10]
                              I loved Konosuba season 2.  You get more of the comedy you loved from season 1, plus additional bonuses.
                              The main thing that I want to convey to you is that I really enjoyed this series! It made me laugh a lot in unpredictable ways and I loved the characters. For me is wasn't the type of anime that I thought about in the week between each episode but one that I really enjoyed coming back to each week and was really sad when I realised it only had 10 episodes and I had watched them all. So if you want something chill to watch that will make you laugh this is the show for you!
                              THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR THE 1ST SEASON, PLEASE DO WATCH KONOSUBA'S 1ST SEASON BEFORE READING THIS, UNLESS YOU WANNA GET HEAVY SPOILERS!
                              Konosuba Season 2 is good. Very good. For sure I enjoyed it from the beginning to the end. But reading the novel made me realize the problem I had with both, this and the previous season, and hadn't noticed until now.
                              (That's my first review) This is a review for season one and two of Konosuba
                              The first season and movie I was able to enjoy with my boyfriend, but sadly I adventured into this second season by myself. I'm not the least bit disappointed in this season and had fun watching more adventures with the gain of weirdos.
                              If you are reading this, then I’ll assume you’ve already seen Konosuba season 1."
"In 2075, space travel is no longer just a dream, but an everyday reality for mankind. Advancements in science and technology have led to the colonization of the moon, the commercialization of outer space, and the formation of large space corporations. Ai Tanabe, an upbeat woman whose interests lie in the cosmos, joins Technora Corporation as a member of their Debris Section, a department dedicated to the removal of dangerous space junk between the orbits of the Earth and Moon.

However, Ai soon discovers how unappreciated her job is. As the laughingstock of Technora, the Debris Section is severely understaffed, poorly funded, and is forced to use a dilapidated spaceship nicknamed the ""Toy Box"" for debris retrieval. Undeterred, Ai perseveres and gradually becomes acquainted with the strange personalities that make up the Debris Section's staff, such as the bumbling but good-natured chief clerk Philippe Myers; the mysterious and tight-lipped temp worker Edelgard Rivera; and the hotheaded and passionate Hachirouta Hoshino, who longs for a spaceship to call his own.

Planetes is an unconventional sci-fi series that portrays the vastness of space as a backdrop for the personal lives of ordinary people—people who may have been born on Earth, but whose hopes and dreams lie amongst the stars.

How could a show like that possibly be interesting? Well I'm here today to tell you that this is one of the best anime out there, and something everyone should give a try.
                              Growing up, I'm sure many of us have stared into the night sky at one time or another, trying to process the sprawled out abyss, bewildered by its seemingly endless stretches into darkness. Just the very thought of how all-encompassing it is can be equal parts awe-inspiring and intimidating, as we try to find our place in it all. Like our ancestors before us and later generations yet to take our place, us humans have and always will be drawn to the great unknown; like moths to a flame, we pursue things no matter how unsure we may be about the outcome. Always seeking out          
                              Space, the final frontier, and what a frontier it is. Humans long ago looked up at the stars, and reached out to grasp them. From the words of Captain Kirk, ""to boldly go where no man has gone before"". 
                              A Good Anime, but...
                              It is a time... when collecting space debris... is very important! Really seriously business here, guys!
                              The story of PLANETES gets off to a slow start which may put some viewers off, however the slow paced introduction of the characters and their personalities adds a more personal feel to the show, allowing you to get to know the characters as if in real life, finding more and more about them as things progress. As the main storyline begins to develop we are given an even deeper insight into the personal lives of the team aside from their &quot;garbage collector&quot; jobs in outer space, their aspirations for the future and the past that they can't forget. 
                              PLANETES is set in the Year 2075 A.D. when mankind have started fledging their occupancy into the solar system. However, constant travel to and from, between earth and space have started generating debris in the earth and moon's orbits. A space accident caused by the debris, which lead to the deaths of many passengers traveling in a space-shuttle lead to many concerns and for the first time the debris has been considered as a threat in space. Thus 'Debris Section' is made. Debris Section, as the name suggests, is assigned to collect debris to prevent any such tragic incident in the future. 
                              A mature low sci-fi drama set in space?  ""Sign me up!,"" or so I was thinking when I started this series.  Unfortunately, my hopes were dashed within the first episode.  The plot in a nut shell is fine; it's a simple slice of life set in space, musing on various aspects of the human condition.  Zoom in any closer than that, though, and the cracks start to appear.  The show is preachy, to say the least.  Every episode is some vehicle for the author to set up straw men and knock them down to carry a shallow message across.          
                              Director Goro Taniguchi has always been known for his extremely popular and critically acclaimed series, Code Geass. Boasting over 220,000 viewers on this site alone, you’d think that some of his other works would be shed into light because of this popularity. Planetes is a show that flies under the radar for two reasons: the first being that the show, as of this year, is a decade old, and the second reason being that it will always be overlooked by the 10x more popular (literally) Code Geass. 
                              Not often do you stumble across a slice of life having its setting in space itself, being the other worthy title Space Brothers. The idea of human exodus to space will be sooner or later a reality, and with that, debris in its area as well. Planetes narrates the daily life of Garbage Man collecting space debris to ensure a safe environment for all the different modules and ships in Earth's orbit, in addition to expanding on both politics and existentialism of humans related to its exodus. There were some issues with the anime, the comedic elements being the main culprit for hindering its immersion          
                              Reading the synopsis and reviews, I really wanted to like ""Planetes"". Even given how slow the first ten episodes were, I kept hope alive and watched to the end, waiting for the magic which seemed to have charmed so many viewers. There is a lot to be said for the series: its vision for the future is exceptional, for one. Yet in spite of it all, I did not particularly enjoy Planetes and consider it a middling series. Overall, I would recommend giving it a try!
                              This was one of the few anime series I have picked up sight-unseen, based just on reviews in an industry magazine.  Luckily, I was not disappointed. 
                              This is a slow anime in the beggining, in which nothing happens, and too fast paced in the second half, in a way that may confuse one.
                              Coming from a former aeronautical engineering major, space was the first thing that drew me to Planetes, though it wasn’t quite the space exploration anime I was initially thinking it would be.  Nothing flashy here, just the story of a space debris (garbage if you will) collection team and one man’s desire to own his own spaceship to explore space on his own.  However, Planetes had so much more to offer, whether it’s romance, loss, real world comparisons or just great, relatable characters… this show had it all, and it had me eagerly skipping to the next episode and never let me down.          
                              If you are not over 16, do not watch this anime. You will not get the plethora of social, political, psychological, and moral motifs. Plus, it is a bit too heavy hearted. "

                              For a person who did not accompany the novel, this ONA was absurdly incredible, without words, the new animation was very pleasing to me.
                              Disclaimer: Novel reader > Biased
                              Awesome anime about the world of the professional game industry. As a fan of this type of events. I loved the anime and this Special episodes. 
                              The first season has had growing pains and, fortunately, the lessons learned have been incorporated. The first episode of the ONA is a confident, competent stride with all-around better animation and direction. It now uses creative ways and shot angles to help express the emotions of a moment and that presents one of the biggest leaps of the franchise coming from Season 1’s piss-poor direction and a tendency to telegraph everything to the viewer, sometimes in the most obnoxious slapstick way possible, reinforced by the janky animation of that season. Here, however, the motions are more fluid and subdued. And it’s a much better product          
                              *Spoilers Ahead, (though seriously if you watched it already then its fine)*
                              I was planning to watch just 1 episode at a time, but I was glued to the screen and watched all three back to back.
                              As a short ova follow on to the main show of The King's Avatar Aka Quanzhi Gaoshou Tencent has done a great job, The story follows on and leaves you wanting more.
                              Even tho I loved the first season and was looking towards this full of hopes and full of excitement, it ws rather disapointing. 
                              Having loved the first season, i was very eager to see this second season.
                              EDIT: Just finished watching the last ep, and it was quite the suprise. Much of my review still is the same. Others may disagree and they are certainly entitled to that ;)
                              For having spent a year on three episodes, some parts of the animation is rather disappointing, especially episode 1. I can see a lot of people being turned off from it after that episode. But the parts where you can tell that's where they put all their money into, i.e. Gao Yingjie vs Wang Jiexi, the animation and the style used there is amazing. Fortunately, the quality of the episodes gets better after that. "
"In the final years of the Bakumatsu era lived a legendary assassin known as Hitokiri Battousai. Feared as a merciless killer, he was unmatched throughout the country, but mysteriously disappeared at the peak of the Japanese Revolution. It has been ten peaceful years since then, but the very mention of Battousai still strikes terror into the hearts of war veterans.

Unbeknownst to them, Battousai has abandoned his bloodstained lifestyle in an effort to repent for his sins, now living as Kenshin Himura, a wandering swordsman with a cheerful attitude and a strong will. Vowing never to kill again, Kenshin dedicates himself to protecting the weak. One day, he stumbles across Kaoru Kamiya at her kendo dojo, which is being threatened by an impostor claiming to be Battousai. After receiving help from Kenshin, Kaoru allows him to stay at the dojo, and so the former assassin temporarily ceases his travels.

Rurouni Kenshin: Meiji Kenkaku Romantan tells the story of Kenshin as he strives to save those in need of saving. However, as enemies from both past and present begin to emerge, will the reformed killer be able to uphold his new ideals?

I looked up the original year expecting to feel old, but somehow 2003 doesn’t seem that long ago. It’s actually almost exactly 13 years. I grew up on this show, and one way or another I’m willing to bet the same could be said of most people still visiting this MAL page. Rurouni Kenshin gave me the hope that I too could be a samurai in a modern world unsuited for one. That hasn’t worked out very well for me.
                              Based on the actual Meiji Period of Japan, Rouruni Kenshin is a Shounen, Action, Adventure about a wandering samurai, &quot;Kenshin&quot;. Even though he is a kind and friendly person, he carries a bloody past he wishes not to return to. This shounen anime starts of like any other as we are introduced to the characters the story revolves around (Kenshin) and we learn quite a bit about them. Also like the typical shounen anime, once all the main characters are together to form some kind of fighting team, it starts of with couple short random adventures. There's plenty of action and comedy here but it          
                              Your deeds of the past is something you won't be able to evade, neither ignore in any way: it will always come back gnawing at you. This is the tale of Himura Kenshin, who once was a ruthless assassin in the past, in his quest of finding redemption from his previous actions. Rorouni Kenshin: Meiji Kenkaku Romantan is a magnificent, well crafted samurai based anime with fantastic characterization and story, which is so rare to find these days. However, it is profoundly clear that the anime falls apart in the last third of its duration, due to fillers.
                              One of the more popular anime of the older generation out there is Rurouni Kenshin. If one is a fan of more of the retro productions or even for the more modern ones, most people have heard of this highly spoken of anime. I myself am more of a modern viewer; however, I gave Rurouni Kenshin a try and was surprised at the depth and entertainment this anime gave.
                              Ahh, ""Rurouni Kenshin"", one of first really long series that I'd watched. A series that at times epitomises the best of fighting shounens while at other times perfectly demonstrates the pitfalls of adapting popular, long running shounen manga.
                              (NO SPOILERS! If you have not seen the Prequel to this anime there will be no spoilers either) 
                              Man its been awhile since i watched this but i recently watched an amv of kenshin and i just felt inspired to write so lol:P
                              Absolutely horrible. I don't know what can make a  series so unwatchable while its OVA and movies were fantastic. The lame excuses of jokes that this anime try to come up with makes you want to hop off a cliff. Kenshin totally does not possess the aura of a fighter but rather a klutz and fails at being funny. Even during the fights, it is just ridiculously stupid. E.g. forgot the name but there was this one villain who has a blade that reeks of the fats of the victims that he slaughtered in the past that when he fights his blade becomes coated

                              Rurouni Kenshin (A) &ndash; in my opinion, THE samurai anime.  It&rsquo;s a series that attempts to blend reality and history with superhuman action and suspense.  It succeeds at being hugely entertaining and almost flawless.
                              The hard part about reviewing this series is if you decide to count the filler arcs as part of the series.  The quality of the story telling between the canon (based on the manga) and the filler (stuff they did to give the manga time to catch up) is radically different.  I've seen both subbed and dubbed episodes but I'm more familiar with the dubbed version so I'll be reviewing that.  I will note that much of the context of what is said in the Japanese version is missing, for which I recommend reading the wikipedia synopsis of this show because it          
                              I was a little hesitant to start this anime but upon one of my closet friend's persistence, I gave in and managed to finish the entire anime within two weeks time (while juggling between school and work). I'm honestly so glad that I gave it a try because it has become one of my all-time favorites and this beautiful work of art truly deserves to be called a masterpiece. Firstly, the plot itself is beautifully written (or drawn) illustrating wanderer Kenshin's journey of saving lives as a form of repentance due to his actions being ""Battousai, the manslayer"" in the war(s) prior to the Meija          
                              This was the first anime I ever watched back when I was like 8 and I remember totally falling in love with Kenshin’s swordsmanship ways. Therefore now I am older, I decided to rewatch it to see whether I felt the same amasement as I once felt as a child."
"In the Sengoku period of Japan, a young orphan named Kotarou and his dog Tobimaru steal from unsuspecting villagers in order to make ends meet. However, Kotarou is forced to remain on the run when he finds himself being hunted down by assassins sent by China's Ming Dynasty for mysterious reasons not involving his petty crimes. 

Fortunately, the duo run into Nanashi, a ronin who has taken refuge in a small temple, when Kotarou is attacked and Tobimaru poisoned. Although the samurai  saves the helpless pair from their pursuers, he feels that there is no need to help them further; but when offered a gem in exchange for his services as a bodyguard, he reluctantly accepts Kotarou's offer of employment—just until Tobimaru is healed and the two reach their destination. As the three set out on a perilous journey, it soon becomes evident that their path is riddled with danger, as the Ming Dynasty has now sent a terrifying swordsman after them to capture Kotarou and fulfill a certain prophecy.

There are scenes in it that are shocking, jaw-dropping, amazing...if you haven't seen this movie yet, and you like action movies, with a good plot, solid characters, and the best action sequences I've ever seen in an anime, then beg, borrow, stea---er, do whatever you can to get your hands on it. You won't regret it. Take my word for it.
                              Story:
                              Are you searching for a bland movie with a paucity in character development, predictable plot points, and subpar-to-average animation, then you’re in luck — because Sword of the Stranger (Stranger: Mukou Hadan) exists for your substandard anime expectations.  For anyone who does have a shred of self-respect, however, should eschew themselves from this tedious movie watching experience for something with, I don’t know, some modicum of originality.  But I digress, on to the review.
                              An epic tale of a young boy on the run for his life and a mysterious wandering samurai who coincidentially run into eachother at a abadoned temple. The rest of the story falls into place after thier meeting. Within the first 10 minutes of this anime you are engulfed in a small battle of thieves trying to rob a caravan whose guards are these mysterious samurai with red capes, giving you a taste of what kind of action and gore that is to come. Heads and limbs get cut off and arrows pierce necks and heads in a wonderful display of swordsmanship and archery. If          
                              I happened to stumble upon a little hidden gem, a couple days back by the name ""Sword of the Stranger"".  I was surprised by how few people were talking about the film.  The only threads I found about the anime were very specific and spoiler heavy; no general discussions, no recommendation topics.  Naturally this lead me to suspect the worst, but I figured I'd give SOTS a shot anyway.  Besides, at only an hour and a half in length I wouldn't be wasting that much time.  I'm quite glad I did, because this movie is the very definition of a          
                              Andy, from AnimeNfo, wrote: &quot;Stranger is a martial arts tale of self sacrificing heroism. This premise is far from original, as are the characters. It is nonetheless solid, and combined with all the dramatic brutality one could ask for from Samurai action, the complete package is a joy to watch.&quot; 
                              I initially saw previews of this movie while I was in Japan last October. It was being released pretty much right after I left, and I was there for a full month. But there was an awesome display at the Manga museum in Kyoto with an original script, and other memorabilia. When I saw the previews, I knew this movie was going to rock. But I never imagined BONES would deliver such a timeless tale. This movie will become one of the classics as time progresses.
                              This movie did, as someone mentioned in their review, come out of nowhere. I actually learned of it because there was a poster for the dubbed version showing in the US theatres coming in Feb. 
                              When I decided to watch this movie it was without any expectations but I was more than pleasantly surprised! Sword of the Stranger has to be one of the best lesser-known anime out there and for how good it is, it deserves to be much, much more popular. 
                              Story: 9
                              This is my first review and I am doing it in order to improve how I judge the anime I watch. Thus, I am sticking to the story/art/sound/character/enjoyment rating, because I think it is a good way to categorize rating.
                              Some men kill in order to live.  Some don't need a reason...
                              Let me start by saying this movie has great animation and great action BUT that's where the praise ends for this movie. 
                              Sword of the Stranger is not a groundbreaking or innovative dish you would find in a five-star restaurant, but rather an average dish with all your favorite ingredients which you love to savor day after day. This film doesn’t fall into the trap of constantly trying to be what it isn’t, that being a frequent issue with many shows and movies alike. It knows its limits, explores the possibilities within the boundaries, and milks every bit of essence out of it making a simple, yet delightful experience. It is neither groundbreaking nor the pinnacle of story telling, but it was a whole damn lot of          
                              Entertainment factors: Fight scenes, insane choreography, subtle social themes, Japanese culture, hand-drawn animation."

Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata have both produced some of the most imaginative works ever put to the animation medium, and their genius efforts show in most of their creations. Add in to the fact that Joe Hisaishi is one of the best soundtrack composers in all of Anime, and you’ve got yourself a trio that has produced works that were nearly perfect in every sense of the word. Unfortunately, a group of professionals          
                              I know this movie is almost 30 years old, but I recently re-watched it and I cried reminiscing about my childhood and thought I should write my first review on it. Tenkuu no Shiro Laputa aka Castle in the Sky is tied as my favorite Miyazaki movie alongside Princess Mononoke; my 2 favorite movies as a child.
                              Castle in the sky is the third film made by Hayao Miyazaki, who I've come to believe is one of the most masterful storytellers. The story is based on the Laputa of Gulliver's Travels, a floating city of scientists and ideologist, which is a legend, a dream of explorers. The young miner Pazu in the story has a goal, which is to find Laputa just as his father did before. And one day, a girl Sheeta who is wearing a magical necklace drifting down from the sky into Pazu's arms, their adventure begins.  
                              Studio Ghibli is arguably one of the greatest anime film studios of all time, setting the standard for Japanese animation many times over since its inception. They are responsible for producing some of the best animated films ever seen; blessing anime fans with several classic films over the decades and creating countless spectacles along with them, many of which were made under the guidance of legendary director and Studio Ghibli founder, Hayao Miyazaki. Together, their library includes the likes of Howl’s Moving Castle, Princess Mononoke, and of course the Academy Award-winning Spirited Away. But before all that, the studio giant had to begin somewhere. And          
                              'Laputa: Castle in the Sky' is incredibly similar to a much loved TV series from years gone by called 'Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water'... which is hardly shocking when you consider that Miyazaki, the director of Laputa, came up with the idea that later became Nadia!
                              I feel like the studio and Director would be a give away that this would be good. I don’t know what to fully talk about as everything about this show is amazing from the story to the animation to the dub. Even the comedy doesn’t get in the way of the great story that lies within this show. Only one or two things bother me but they aren’t that big, like when Pazu jumps off his house and ends up breaking through bricks into his basement with no broken bones or nothing. Of course, these problems are minor and don’t happen all that much.
                              This was my first anime EVER and my gateway to the anime world. So I have a very high respect for it in those regards. 
                              When I originally watched ""Laputa: Castle in the Sky"", it felt pretty similar to the rest of Miyazaki's works, but now that I'm older, watched more of his films and more anime in general and written more reviews, I've come to realise that it does contain quite a few elements that are not the norm for his other works.
                              Laputa is notable among long-time anime fans as being the first official Studio Ghibli film made in 1986. This steampunk fantasy-adventure film focuses on our main pairing of Pazu and Sheeta seeking out the whereabouts of the mysterious land in the sky, Laputa, while evading both a gang of sky pirates and members of the military seeking Sheeta to guide them to Laputa for their own varying ends.
                              Miyazaki's Masterpiece.
                              This is Hayao Miyazaki’s second major movie after Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind (he also did Castle of Cagliostro but that is just a Lupin the 3rd side story so I don’t count it as major). This time he went for something much lighter than a grim post-apocalyptic setting; it is a lot more conventional and easy-going so I hardly enjoyed it as much as Nausicaa.
                              In the early 1980s, a man named Hayao Miyazaki was just hot off the success of one of his first animated features, Nausicaa and the Valley of the Wind. With all the money that came in thanks to Nausicaa's success, he decided to make his own company. With lots of hard work and help from friends, namely Isao Takahata and Toshio Suzuki, Studio Ghibli was born. The first movie Ghibli ever made was this one, Laputa: Castle In The Sky, or just Castle In The Sky, since Laputa is apparently an offensive Spanish slur, not that the producers knew that at the time. From all          
                              This is what started it all for me.
                              Castle In The Sky is an intriguing story about a 13 year old girl called Sheeta, who has a magic necklace, that can save her, and help her when she needs it.
                              First of all, this is Hayao Miyazaki. Nothing is bad. Let's just all understand that."
"In 1950s Japan, Tatsuo Kusakabe relocates himself and his two daughters, Satsuki and Mei, to the countryside to be closer to their mother, who is hospitalized due to long-term illness. As the girls grow acquainted with rural life, Mei encounters a small, bunny-like creature in the yard one day. Chasing it into the forest, she finds ""Totoro""—a giant, mystical forest spirit whom she soon befriends. Before long, Satsuki too meets Totoro, and the two girls suddenly find their lives filled with magical adventures in nature and fantastical creatures of the woods.

",8.31,8,224,123,732596,6838,"                              Childhood is a blossoming period of learning and developing one's own idiosyncrasies. It has always been a sedate stage in which little youngsters define themselves through their senseless antics—ones that appear innocent but are of an elusive nature, and are merely an inadvertent expression of the capricious phase that is childhood. However, since kids are so full of youthful tendencies, very few directors have managed to portray the rascals in a sincere and realistic manner. But among those select few is an irreplaceable Ghibli film which has become a sensation both within its native community and the western world—and that film is Hayao Miyazaki's My          
                              I remember Totoro was my favorite anime. I'd pop it in the VCR player (yes, old school, I know) and watching it with my little brother when I was a little girl. Somewhere around 14 years later, it's still my favorite movie, and probably always will be.
                              Another win for Miyazaki!
                              It's often easy to get carried away in the everyday vices and tribulations of life. We often want to reminisce and look back on the better days, full of adventure and enjoyment. Well, this movie does an excellent job of bringing me back to that feeling. It is full of heart-whelming adventure, and exploration.
                              My Neighbor Totoro is a wonderful telling of child curiosity with some sprinkles of coming of age. It's surprisingly flat on plot, but I can't really tell you what I was expecting. I wanted... more, but I don't know why. It was a perfectly fine film. The story is really cute, the characters are really cute and compelling. It looks amazing, but for some reason, I was expecting Spirited Away. This is nowhere near that. This is the last Miyazaki review I do for a while. Nothing really seems to have the same impact on me as Spirited Away. It's disappointing.           
                              My Neighbor Totoro is the flagship of Ghibli and one of the first Japanese animated feature films to receive wide critical acclaim in the west. As much as its successor 'Spirited Away' capitalized further in terms of revenue, Totoro stands as one of the most influential anime, with the ubiquitousness of Totoro plushies and pop culture references to it still present today. But there are reasons beyond its success that attributes it as a must watch on the checklist of any avid fan of anime. 
                              I was down with the flu and I was curled up in my room, looking for something cozy to watch. Flipping through my collection, I suddenly remembered the My Neighbor Totoro DVD I had received as a gift a while back. Needless to say, I popped it into my player, sat back and had one of the most relaxing and peaceful 90 minutes of my life.
                              Tonari no Totoro - Would be one of the best Animes I saw when I saw little.
                              What more can be said about My Neighbor Totoro? Get this movie. Immediately. Without a doubt one of the best animated features ever made, Japan or otherwise, Totoro is an outstanding original creation from Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli.
                              My Neighbour Totoro begins with a cheerful ride of a family of three: two young girls and their father. The vast, watery fields, reflecting the morning light, as well as a distinct, towering forest pass by in a flash. Shortly after, the trio arrives at the steps of what's to become their new home.
                              My Neighbor Totoro is a weird movie. It's also one of Hayao Miyazaki's first directorial works as well as his first film with Studio Ghibli. Totoro is often cited as classic anime, but is it really any good? It's hard for me to say; I'm not a big fan of Miyazaki or family movies. It's a bit melodramatic, though some people would rephrase it as touching. It's hard to relate to the main characters because they're so annoying! They seem to yell all the time. My Neighbor Totoro also has Miyazaki's signiture trippy scenes, such as Totoro with the umbrella and the catbus. While I          
                              It's cute!
                              “A four-year-old child could understand this report….Run out and find me a four-year-old child. I can't make head or tail out of it.”
                              Sigh...How should I describe my most cherished and precious childhood memory of my whole life so that I wouldn't understate it at all?!?!
                              STORY: My Neighbor Totoro is simple and whimsical. Although the story is a children's fable, the heart of the tale can draw out the child in everyone. The movie begins in a period of transition for a family, and the movie concludes alongside the end of the transition. The finished product is like a meaningful photograph. The events occurring in the story or picture are not life changing. It's the memory and feeling you take away that holds the worth of the story in Totoro. However, the story is not ground-breaking or awe-inspiring.  But the it is delightful and unforgettable."

A shocking betrayal and a battle that risks all of their lives. After this revelation, they will never be the same again.",8.31,8,225,1635,82313,899,"                              Tsubasa Chronicle's anime experience has been a very rocky one. In spite of staying true to the manga to an extent, the original TV series was shameless in it's amateur art styl, jilted animation, and wholly uneven pacing. Fans got a brief look at something amazing when the short movie came out and wondered, &quot;what if Production I.G. did the canon story of Tsubasa?&quot;
                              Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicles was a great series in and of itself. It was portrayed in the anime in a very hit or miss fashion  with the quality and editting. The way Bee Train hurt Tsubasa is the equivalent of what 4kids does to anime here. Be that as it may, we're not talking about the original 2 seasons, i'm here to recommend to you.
                              Let me start off by saying I am among a minority of critics that feels the Anime series is a work of misunderstood genius and I'm probably the only one who's tired of the Bee Train haterz because OCD CLAMP fans can't stand anything that's different from the Manga.  That's not to say I don't recognize the flaws in Bee Train's TV anime series, but nothing is with out it's flaws.   With Tokyo Revelations being picked up by Production I.G from BEE TRAIN I wasn't sure what to really expect.
                              Tsubasa Chronicle: Tokyo Revelations did what the rest of the anime series failed to do: be interesting. While the art style is more or less the same, it is obvious in the first few minutes that it has been supplemented with greater detail, some additional special effects here and there, and the animation seems to move more smoothly and remain more &quot;active&quot;, versus the all-too-boring and sluggish feel of Tsubasa Chronicle and Tsubasa Chronicle 2nd Season.
                              I believe that Tsubasa Chronicle Tokyo Revelations was a fabulous continuation, giving us a clearer insight into the background of all the characters and the plot. For those who are slightly confused while having watched Tsubasa so far, these OVA's are of an extreme help in painting a more 'clearer' picture of the story in general. It explains so much, while still providing us with even MORE surprises to keep our minds wheeling with excitement and curiosity. Compared to the seasons before, the artwork is exceptionally better and I also believe that the climax of the story still has yet to reach its peak. The

                              ONLY for those who are already familiar with Tsubasa and even then probably only for those who have read the manga or have done some looking into outside of just watching the anime. Otherwise, you'll have little to no clue what is going on. 
                              This OVA was absolutely... AMAZING!
                              Tsubasa Chronicles: Tokyo Revelations is a three part movie
                              Tsubasa: Tokyo Revelations was pretty special at times, it had the kind of CLAMP magic that you see in various other media by them, such as Magic Knight Rayearth, Cardcaptor Sakura, or even Code Geass. 
                              We're not in Kansas anymore.
                              As a fan Tsubasa, this was a little too irresistible to keep from picking up. I was pretty happy in the end. If you haven't watched Tsubasa before, or if you don't know much about it (even just having seen the first season), I strongly recommend you don't watch this. There would be very little sense to it, and a lot of piecing together scraps of information.
                              How can something so simple become so complicated? This will be my first thought while watching Tokyo Revelations...
                              In my mind, the animation was better than in the first seasons. I have to admit, that some scenes were unfortunately not able to keep up with the rest (third OVA: Fay looked like a fish desperately longing for air O.o). Nonetheless the storyline was very interesting and not so easy to understand, which I find very exciting.
                              *CLAP CLAP CLAP, Tsubasa Tokyo Revelations (TTR) Is a masterpiece, this OVA is Dark, mysterious, fucking amazing and something that makes your mind gone insane for some events, fucking events. . . "

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.32,8,212,664,222254,3040,"                              This anime reminds me of an art-house film. One very specific art-house film - Garden State. The one about which a classic said, “If cancer were pretentious, it would be Garden State.” Wonder Egg Priority with its bumbling attempts to be profound invokes the same familiar feeling of a student movie way over its head.
                              Wonder Egg has come, and it's hit so many marks and boundaries, it's unreal. No matter where I go, no matter who I talk to when it comes to WE, it's always in a positive tone. Even I recommended it to a friend, and they enjoyed it too. That's the quality of Wonder Egg. Really top notch stuff, but let me explain why this is the case within this review.
                              This review might be what I understood and what I believe it would be or could be about this anime. Before anything I want to say that don't get scammed by just the slice of life tag... it more than that, I can assure.
                              Overall: 9/10
                              *TRIGGER WARNING* (very slight spoilers too)
                              Wonder Egg Priority is a pretentious mess that tries to sell itself as a deep and complicated story, but remains in the end another waifubait show. It brings to the table a lot of ""hot topics"" such as school bullying, teen suicide, sexism and sexual harassment, but never explores them in depth, it just throws more and more OMG SO DARK twists without any attempt to give them a meaningful context or resolution. 
                              TL;DR
                              I’ll put a 10 for now but we’ll see how it ends but just right now I’m enjoying this the most out of all the winter lineup and there’s a ton of great anime.
                              Depressed disguised magical girls doing cute things. Fast pace main characters's introduction, maybe fine not too soon, hopefully there will be more depth. 
                              So I reviewed Wonder Egg Priority last week out of pure excitement for the series, but it got taken down since episode 4 wasn't even out yet, so I figured I'd come back now to finish the job. Originally I gave the show a 10 for reasons I'll elaborate on in the review itself, but as you can see I've bumped it down to a 9.
                              It's not like I hate this series, but I just don't find the thing that make me enjoy this. This series just about someone making friends with someone that have same regrets while fighting monster. Maybe my interpretation wasn't right, but that what I feel. 
                              TLDR: Wonderful art and music, charming voice acting and characters, interesting story that's slowly opening up!
                              Beautiful visuals, tasteful subject matter, incredible animation, great voice actors, 8/10 so far
                              I want to start out by saying, that with all the absurdly popular sequels airing this season, I did not expect a new show that came from no where to be the thing I enjoyed the most, and stick with me in my mind for so long. The visuals for the show are utterly stunning--excluding the Senoevils which are the only reason I'd rate the art 9/10 for the show--and I can't stop listening to the full versions of the Opening and Ending songs.
                              First I'll say what makes the anime so good, its that its so realistic when talking about the social sense. "

How can I say? I wasn't really unpleasant... but a bit stubborn. However, don't imagine that I was arguing. If only ... on the contrary, I didn't say anything, and I preferred to get away from them. I couldn't express myself correctly with the others and I didn't dare to reproach them for fear of hurting them. None of us tried to understand each other and we ended up moving away and taking different ways.
                              Spring 2015 was a heavy season. Out of all the shows though, there was one particular that stood out and it’s Hibike Euphonium (Sound Euphonium). Produced by one of the highest quality anime studios ever, the show is still much more than an eye candy fest. So when I heard the series was returning for a sequel, I was ecstatic. Hibike Euphonium 2 is like a gift that keeps on giving.
                              As a person who loves listening to most genre of music ranging from classic to hardcore metal, dub-step to jazz, I can strongly recommend this anime to everyone regardless of their anime preferences or music taste. To be honest, it has much more potential than most music anime until date. Hibike! Euphonium can definitely inspire viewers on so many levels because this gem reflects and portrays so many state of human emotion in a spectacular fashion.
                              Hibike! Euphonium: Wholehearted Sincerity
                              School is the perfect location for coming of age stories. It's a shame that this potential is little utilized. Thankfully, Hibike is an exception. It's an anime with chewed to death school settings, with clichéd competition aspect, that manages to be a fresh breath of air. Hibike is a well-told simple story.
                              After the disappointing third season of Haikyuu!! I was hoping that Hibike Euphonium would atleast have a good second season that I would've enjoyed. Unfortunately I was wrong. Although not as broken as Haikyuu!! S3, Hibike Euphonium season 2 was still a very disappointing sequel to what was otherwise a great first season.
                              I have a feeling that there will be those who want to give this anime a perfect 10/10 but perhaps will shy away because of the great divide in the community. So, here I am. Writing a review for an anime which I thought not only needs to be properly addressed as to why it should be considered a masterpiece but demands a standing ovation in the way it has executed almost everything to perfection.
                              The second season of Hibike! Euphonium, in my opinion, is better than the first. This season feels like a more refined and concentrated version of what Hibike! Euphonium is, and that improvement alone turns a good anime into a great anime.
                              Band has becoming a dying medium as the importance of academics and becoming a top student have gained importance.  It's come to the point that many schools have cut off art programs like these entirely simply because they either no longer have the budget to support it, or see it as something that has no real importance in students' lives.  So, at the time of this review, while we still have the concept of the school band alive, we return back to KyoAni's adaptation of Hibike! Euphonium, the drama-filled band with aspirations as big as their sound.
                              Hibike!Euphonium an enjoyable yet a smart approach to the beauty of wind orchestra and the musician's soul that aims to shine brightly among all the other orchestra members.This anime really made me fall in love for the first time with Trumpet, Euphonium & Oboe And made me fall in love again with classical music. I can not forget also the personalities of our characters that take us in this beautiful ride throughout the anime.And as always our KyoAni's aesthetic unique animation.The plot is great, the music is a cherry on top and the whole anime is deserved to be watched again & again.
                              A Sound! Euphonium 2 Review
                                           Sequels are like a double-edged sword. For the good shows, the creators are always under immense pressure to replicate the success from the first season, but if done correctly, will be able to grow the cult following for an even bigger profit. For the bad shows, though there are no such expectations, the need to create a series to a non-existent fan base is illogical. Hibike! Euphonium season 1 was in the middle of the spectrum, dwarfed by the popularity and sales of the likes of K-ON while still having sales and          
                              You know that awkward moment when all the yuri shipping you did made people think you made a LGBT anime to the point that Crunchyroll had to tweet about it?
                              Hibike Euphonium 2 gives you the same thing you’ve come to expect by this point – high school lesbians playing brass instruments, if you liked it then, you’ll like it now, the story, and the presentation of that story remains rather unchanged, and so, there is rather little for me to actually say about it. It is more of the same - it looks the same, it sounds the same, and it overall feels the same, which isn’t a bad thing by any means, considering that last time around it looked, sounded and felt great, and I can respect a studio that understands the value          
                              And so the next piece begins...with the second season of Hibike Euphoinum!. Nach und nach belebter und leidenschaftlicher!"

                              If you're a fan of the first season of Dr. Stone, then you have to give the second season a try. The second season picks up right where the first season stopped and is full of action since the first episode. All our favourite characters are back, including the quirky ones (isn't this almost all of them? haha). The animation is still on par with the first season as well as the sound and general approach to the series.
                              Preliminary review:
                              I know this review might be a bit cotroversial. I also do know that it will be impossible for me to properly convey my feelings and throughts about this show with words as I simply lack the experience writing reviews.
                              Dr.Stone comes back at it again with a second season. At the time of writing this review, the first four episodes were really good and I know that the rest won’t disappoint. 
                              Have you ever dreamed of Going into the past With a couple of your modern gadgets? That's practically impossible unless you have a time machine. But if you had dreams like that i am sure you would love this series.But the catch is  instead of going to the past The Protagonists go to the future where Humans are extinct and everything is green.Let me correct myself instead of the protagonists going to the future we can say that all of the living Humans in Earth have been turned into non aging statues But it is the protagonist who is First to become normal AND          
                              I'm only writing a review for season 2 just because it honestly has gotten 100% better.
                              Dr. Stone is back, and it's back with a bang. It truly is, as if it never left the season it aired, and continues onward in it's entertaining scientific fun. Let me explain why."

The phrase of “been born with a silver spoon in his mouth” is synonymous relating to an individual born from the rich family. But the series, Silver Spoon/Gin no Saji, stands on the opposite side of that symbol. Most of the characters aren’t rich and neither are any of them born from a wealthy family. However, what they do have is the talent and ambition that drives them to fulfill a dream. Making a dream into a reality is tough. Competitions and life itself becomes an obstacle. Gin no Saji/Silver Spoon delivers that very

                              I really enjoyed the first season of Gin no Saji. It goes w/out saying that I had really high expectations for the second season. And for the most part it didn't disappoint.
                              The Silver Spoon was real after all…

                              Note: this was written a long time ago as a review of both seasons, but I’m submitting it to season 2 because reasons.
                              I think the second season is so much better. Like the show is so much more interesting. I don't think its really good but something about this anime that makes me want to watch the next episode and the next episode and the next episode until I finished it quickly haha. Funny how I didn't want the show to end soon but I keep going to the next episode. Friendship, family, dreams... all the aspects that u can find in real life, it's soooo relatable. And as I expected, I'm glad that Hachiken and Mikage's relationship is progressing haha I really wish the best for          
                              Minor spoilers ahead. Proceed with caution.
                              SILVER SPOON tackles some very different and serious themes in its second season, while still retaining that effervescent charm that made me fall in love with it immediately. Hachiken's growth continues to be compelling and relatable, regardless of what my own school or family experience has been like.
                              Gin no Saji is one of the few feel good anime that just makes you feel refreshed and motivated if you are feeling down or just in the spiral of depression. The story starts off with Hachiken, a normal school student who runs off to an Agricultural school to get a break from all the pressure he's in and the breakdown from not being able to clear his entrance exam.
                              Gin no Saji 2nd Season is undoubtedly a masterpiece in the slice of life genre - for myself especially.
                              The second season of Silver Spoon is just as good as the first, if not better. It continues and develops the story that in the first series was presented so well. There is now a greater focus on the characters and their development, and not only Hachiken as was the case in the first season: now Mikage is a main character as well.
                              This anime is surprisingly enjoyable. I really didn't expect to like it as much as I did. I mean, it's an agricultural anime. You wouldn't think that'd appeal to a majority of people, but it's honestly an anime that anyone would love. It's very charming.

Kazuki Sanada works as a doctor at the same hospital as Kumi and fights strategically. Known for integrating his knowledge of the human body into his fights, Sanada is a fearsome contender—however, more unnerving than his physical ability, he has garnered the support of the nurses. Despite being the champion, Ippo feels the pressure as he must face the daunting challenge, retain his belt, and win over the girl he loves.

However, some of my main gripes in relation to this series will of course be in relation to what was omitted from the manga. For example, I was upset that they took out Hayami vs Kobashi for Sanada&rsquo;s vacated jr. featherweight title, it was a fight people enjoyed and gives further character development for the winner for that fight at some capacity, and it also sets up how Ippo first meets Sanada and Dankichi, which made the build up more dramatic, while in this anime, their initial encounter is just at the weigh-in.

                              This movie was great!!!! It was almost as great as when he won the title, in this movie you see the reason why he loves boxing and what it means to be strong, i personally liked this a lot, he defends his title and and also fights for his love, so please watch and comment on it.Now i wanna see the fight of Takamura for the world title!!! so please can we have this as a movie or a OVA!!!          
                              What makes Hajime No Ippo great are its characters. This includes Ippo's opponents. Unfortunately for this special I felt nothing for Ippo's opponent. The opponent's rationale didn't make sense. Why are you fighting? What are you trying to prove? The latter is never really fleshed out but passingly mentioned. 
                              Where should I begin, another boxing classic.
                              I have watched a lot of series all of them amazing, I'm even practically caught up in the big three but honestly no anime I have watched can top this series and I haven't even finished it yet. This is the first review I have done for an anime, no other anime has motivated me enough to actually take the time to make a review for it. though with this one I feel like I need to get the info out there. This was actually so far in my opinion the highest point of the anime. everything about this movie was just top notch and          
                              I give this special a 10 because of how the characters have built up their relations from the prequel to now.
                              This is one of the rare moments when an anime movie is satisfying. I suspect that this might be because this movie is actually canon.

                              Unfortunately this movie was a little off for me. the bulk of it was funny and enjoyable, but the fight was basically identical to the Sendo one and the opponent is a bit mono dimensional."

                              I loved and enjoyed  the story, the game, the fights, the art, the sounds, the opening/ending, the characters, the final saddest moment at the end of the last episode when i realized that it was the end too. Any person who watched HxH should watch it or the remake HxH 2011.           
                              Ah, a masterpiece. Hunter x Hunter overall is just a blessing that keeps me glued to the screen and away from my responsibilities. This review is aimed at two groups of people: those who are planning to watch this after finishing the rest of the old adaptation, and those who have watched the new 2011 adaptation and are thinking about watching this. These are probably the two biggest groups of people looking into this OVA. 
                              At last, I have arrived at the finale of my reviews of Hunter X Hunter 1999 and its OVAs. Kinda pissed me off that I had to release them during a time I had said I’d be doing nothing but Gundam reviews, but whatever. Sadly however, these OVAs did not end on a good note, as the final events of the 1999 Version of the Greed Island arc are… well, not very good to say the least.
                              The story was good not too complex for us to get lost in and not too simple for it to be predictive and boring. The art was definelty better than the series since the series was in 1999 while the ova was in 2004. Also the music was also composed nicely especially those piano beats.  But there were some problems with it. Firsly it was the pacing. They skipped some parts of the Greed Island Arc and so we didn't really get to immerse ourselves into the characters since they were rushing have the half time until near the end of the ova. The

The world is now more interconnected than ever before, and the city's Public Security Section 9 is responsible for combating corruption, terrorism, and other dangerous threats following this shift towards globalization.

The strong-willed Major Motoko Kusanagi of Section 9 spearheads a case involving a mysterious hacker known only as the ""Puppet Master,"" who leaves a trail of victims stripped of their memories. Like many in this futuristic world, the Puppet Master's body is almost entirely robotic, giving them incredible power.

Pondering about various philosophical questions, such as her own life's meaning, Motoko soon realizes that the one who will provide these answers is none other than the Puppet Master themself.

Some classics are pioneers that introduce novel ideas that are then further improved upon by later works. Other classics are timeless masterpieces that define entire genres as the gold standard; Ghost in the Shell isn't something that is able to meet that standard. The overly simplistic philosophical narrative of GITS just doesn't hold up very well in modern times while other classical pieces have. Ghost in the Shell is a movie driven by concept, a concept that is shown, not told, in a slow, vague approach that requires attention, thought, and          
                              Ah...Ghost In The Shell.  I'm writing this JUST after finishing it.  If you watched the original Matrix and went &quot;Holy Jesus this is the most amazing movie i've ever seen IN MY LIFE&quot; then Ghost in the Shell will dropkick you in the face. Seriously.
                              I took the time watching the highly acclaimed Ghost in the Shell, which is pretty famous for its philosophical and thought-provoking themes.
                              So I finally saw this movie. I've seen both seasons of Stand Alone Complex, Solid State Society, and Innocence, but I hadn't seen the original until now. And you know what? I'm kind of disappointed.
                              Story- 9/10
                              This movie is great, if you want to watch fucking nothing happen for over an hour. I kept thinking, ""when does the action start?"", but it never did. The plot is a trainwreck; trying to connect a series of non sequiturs does not make for something interesting. The art was -OK- for a film from the 90s but I personally did not like the style. Music plays an important role in setting the mood for any presentation but you do not get that with this movie. Instead, you get a bunch of wailing that you're expected to enjoy. Other than that, sound effects were nothing          
                              “If you don’t know where you’re from, then you don’t know where you are, and you don’t know where you’re going.” It’s a clichéd if truthful saying, especially for this film. Well, sort of. This film knows where it’s going, but it doesn’t know how to get there, it doesn’t know where it is, and it doesn’t know where it’s from. This film is a voice pining to speak, but it studders at every word.
                              I watched this two times and fell asleep both times.
                              Based on the manga of the same name by Masamune Shirow, Ghost in the Shell is an account of a not-so-distant future when it’s not uncommon for you to walk on a busy street and bump into cyborgs— humans who have been ‘cyberized’ to such an extent that every aspect of their functioning is taken care of by high-tech equipment within their ‘shell’, the prosthetic body, and ‘ghost’ which is the slang term for consciousness. So what was it that you really bumped into? What is it that differentiates a human from a cyborg? What makes us human— the biological matter, the consciousness or the          
                               ‘’And can you offer me proof of your existence? How can you, when neither modern science nor philosophy can explain what life is?’’
                              I find ""Ghost in the Shell"" just as a concept AMAZING. The combination of the this idea of what  the world could be like in 2029 and the psychological game that this story plays as you move through the movie.
                              Ghost in the Shell is one of the reasons(besides akira) animes became so populare in america and in europe, because it shows how anime are suppost to be. This isnt a commercial product full of clichees and overused artstlye-types, its a beautiful masterpiece of art. But this anime is not made for everyone. It is made to appeal to mature audience, since the majority of anime ( and nearly ever recent made anime) is for teenagers or children, i would suggest you think about it twice before you just randomly start watching this anime, else you will just get confused.
                              I’ve seen Ghost in the Shell 6 years ago and I hated it.
                              Ghost In The Shell - 5/10
                              The 1995 Ghost in the Shell Movie had an interesting setting and concept, but very poor execution. The first 20 minutes of the movie didn't grab my interest, it didn't established why should I care about the characters and the story. The characters are presented badly, they are very bland and uninteresting. There is a modicum of time or no time given to show the viewers the important characters' intentions, backgrounds and personalities."
"When Subaru Natsuki leaves the convenience store, the last thing he expects is to be wrenched from his everyday life and dropped into a fantasy world. Things aren't looking good for the bewildered teenager; however, not long after his arrival, he is attacked by some thugs. Armed with only a bag of groceries and a now useless cell phone, he is quickly beaten to a pulp. Fortunately, a mysterious beauty named Satella, in hot pursuit after the one who stole her insignia, happens upon Subaru and saves him. In order to thank the honest and kindhearted girl, Subaru offers to help in her search, and later that night, he even finds the whereabouts of that which she seeks. But unbeknownst to them, a much darker force stalks the pair from the shadows, and just minutes after locating the insignia, Subaru and Satella are brutally murdered.

However, Subaru immediately reawakens to a familiar scene—confronted by the same group of thugs, meeting Satella all over again—the enigma deepens as history inexplicably repeats itself.

                              Hi all, this is my first review on MAL. Please bare with me, but I feel like I should share my opinion on this and why I gave it the score I did. I wouldn't say I'm the most hardcore anime fan, but I have definitely seen my fair share of shows and am pretty much a typical anime viewer. I review anime in my mind pretty differently than others. Note, there may be a lot of extra information that is unneeded for this review, but I really want to put my perspective on this as much as possible. If you don't care, just scroll          
                              Ahh, the reviewer. The first line of defense to quell the flames of irrational thought and often the bearer of bad news for those of the general public. They're the Buzz Killingtons that take it upon themselves to blow the ""no fun"" whistle and send the partygoers back on the hype-train that they rode in on. It's a thankless job, one that doesn't reward anyone besides the smug satisfaction of the man with the whistle, tipping his top hat and waving ""adieu"" at the fanbase, outraged that someone had the audacity to bring an analytical lens to the ""totally bitchin party, bruh!""
                              Imagine a show that repackages some of the most recurring themes in anime today and make it into a fantasy thriller. That’s what Re:Zero essentially is. Adapted from the novels of the same name, the show is more of a darker fantasy story than most people may be familiar with. It’s not exactly like a show where a character is stuck in a world and they try to find a way out. Or is it making a parody of the show itself. Rather, Re:Zero (Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu) is a fantasy thriller that has some delirious complexity.
                              A final review of Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu 
                              Before I start my review, let me just say one thing - FUCKING WATCH THIS SHIT! You will never expect what's coming if you just base your opinion on its premise or art style.
                              Re: Zero was an anime that I thought wouldn't be very good. I started watching the episode expecting to be dissapointed that it would be a generic ""other world"" anime. I thought this up until the last scene were the main character is murdered. Soon afterward he ""respawns"" at a fruit stand in the market, this is what hooked me. I realized that this anime is doing something no anime has done before. It made me care about the characters, and even become sad when they died even though I knew it would just be reset when Subaru dies.
                              Note: This review was written a while ago when the show was over. Thus, it does not necessarily represent my current opinions, writing, scores or anything really. Still, I somewhat stand with the core ideas of the review.
                              Re: Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu. 
                              This is quite though anime to give insights on. There are a lot of part from this anime that I really like, as much as parts that I didn't really like. But I did enjoy this anime a lot and it is worth for overall 9.
                              This review of Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu is solely based on my personal views and overall enjoyment watching the show.
                              Ahh Re:Zero, the anime that is in my opinion looking to be the best show this year (beating erased). The anime that actually inspired me to write my first anime review, despite me being a lazy fk. 
                              This was hands down one of the best anime I have ever seen, The story, art and soundtracks fit together like pieces of the same puzzle giving off - Depending on situation - A feeling of happiness or despair. It will keep you at the edge of your seat craving for more, and that's exactly why I waited for it to finish airing in order to start watching.
                              I'm pretty sure some of you are thinking that Re: Zero is another overhyped anime that isn't nowhere near the hype it deserves. Well, let me just say it now: Re: zero deserves all of that hype and score, or at least most of it. It is an exceptional anime, composed of many different kinds of elements that elevates the anime even further. The entertainment (and despair) it manages to give every single episode is astounding, and paired with great characters and great animation and music, makes this anime truly a must watch for any anime fan."
"Every five years, an exhilarating race called Redline is held, and the universe's most anticipated competition has only one rule: that there are none. Racers are pushed to their absolute limit—a feeling that daredevil driver JP knows all too well. Having just qualified to participate in Redline, he is eager to battle against the other highly skilled drivers, particularly the beautiful rising star and the only other human that qualified, Sonoshee McLaren.

But this year's Redline may be far more dangerous than usual—it has been announced to take place on the planet Roboworld with its trigger-happy military and criminals who look to turn the race to their own advantage. However, the potential danger doesn't stop the racers; in fact, it only adds to the thrill. Relying solely on his vehicle's speed, JP prepares for the event to come, aiming to take first place in the biggest race of his life.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.29,8,236,562,262636,3975,"                              Redline is excellent proof that you can have too much of a good thing. Especially when you neglect everything else in the process.
                              Ah Redline, what words can I use to describe this epic adrenaline rush? To be honest words are not enough, this is one of those films that you have to see to fully comprehend its greatness. However I am going to attempt to pass on my thoughts of this film in this review of what feel is one of the best anime films I have ever seen. Period.
                              Someone showed the Japan­ese ‘Wacky Races’. They were not impressed. “They call this ‘wacky’?”, they said. “We’ll show them wacky”.
                              If Redline was to be described in one word, 'explosive' would be it. This off-the-wall animated racing movie is overflowing with zany antics, over-the-top characters, and logic-defying awesomeness. It doesn't have a complex story, and offers next to nothing for the thinking viewer, but that is obviously not its aim. Redline is a stunning display of visual brilliance, a reminder that the reason we love animation is that it can pull off things that are too ridiculous and outrageous to be accomplished in live action. It is the pinnacle of style over substance.
                              Ah, Redline, the industry’s loudest bomb. A bomb so explosive, so meticulously crafted and vibrant that its aftershocks can still be felt today from all sides of the spectrum, from the painful lack of risks maligned in today’s time, to the cult following that spawned from the ashes. A decade later, and the film’s still one of the biggest spectacles in the business, so it may have just won in the end.

                              Way back at the turn of the century a short OVA series was released that went by the name “Trava”. It was a quirky series that was noted mostly for its visual style. The think bold shadows and lines were very much not unlike those of a comic book and it sported some very interesting and experimental animation. It was co-directed by Takeshi Koike, who instead of going on to direct some more anime seemingly stuck in the background and directed bits and pieces of animation here and there. More specifically, he was also behind the Afro Samurai promo, a section of the Animatrix and          
                              Redline is the pinnacle of what every racing movie inspires to be, fast paced, high octane, absolutely insane, and stunningly beautiful. It does this while all being set to one of my favorite anime soundtracks, so good that it rivals those of FLCL, Cowboy Bebop, Madoka, Attack on Titan, Kill la Killa, and the Monogatari Series (as well as anything else that I missed).
                              I'll give credit to Redline that it made for quite the impressive achievement in animation as it was completely animated by hand, which is unheard of these days with computers essentially being used to create all of the animation used for modern anime titles. The movie was brimming with plenty of detail and depth in depicting the violent races that took place in the movie and showing off the scenery of Roboworld as the racers prepared and raced on the planet's surface. The animation depth was slick enough to create the illusion of speedy movement depicted with the racers and any collateral damage coming from          
                              Redline: A Personal Statement
                              Shows that utilize their audio-visual appeal in their own, unique way tend to fly under the radar of most people, if what they are trying to do would be more unconventional and be properly placed in an “artsy” section, but gaining reasonable critical acclaim and a steady increase in popularity the more time passes (e.g. Kaiba and Mononoke). In contrast to that, shows like Bebop and Mushishi’s audio-visuals take a much more grounded route. Their artistical appeal mostly derives from the colour palette and incredible attention to detail, not screwing around with the general ideas of the body structure in fiction and creating a world          
                              ""Redline"" is a film of style. It is a simple story that doesn't take itself too seriously. But this piece is truly art, you could watch it for that reason alone.
                              Let me be frank: No automotive film will ever surpass the experience you will have while watching this. Not even if Top Gear released a movie (although it'd be funnier).
                              Hey, you want to know an anime taking place throughout the far reaches of space that I recently returned to? Redline. I’ve been pruning down my favorites anime list recently, taking out things to ensure that only the best of the best stayed on, and I was curious about whether I’d still enjoy Madhouse’s visual popcorn masterpiece – as oxymoronic as that may sound. So I popped in my Blu-ray a few days ago and here we are."
"Ever since he was a child, fifteen-year-old Souma Yukihira has helped his father by working as the sous chef in the restaurant his father runs and owns. Throughout the years, Souma developed a passion for entertaining his customers with his creative, skilled, and daring culinary creations. His dream is to someday own his family's restaurant as its head chef.

Yet when his father suddenly decides to close the restaurant to test his cooking abilities in restaurants around the world, he sends Souma to Tootsuki Culinary Academy, an elite cooking school where only 10 percent of the students graduate. The institution is famous for its ""Shokugeki"" or ""food wars,"" where students face off in intense, high-stakes cooking showdowns.

As Souma and his new schoolmates struggle to survive the extreme lifestyle of Tootsuki, more and greater challenges await him, putting his years of learning under his father to the test.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.29,8,237,51,1184171,21998,"                              Sorry everyone, I honestly don't know why this show is so highly ranked as it is.
                              Shokugeki no Souma also goes by the name, Food Wars. However, I’d like to call it more as Food Gasm. The reason being is that the character reactions to food is not what you may expect. Or maybe you will once you see how ridiculously delicious the food actually is. What this show brings forth to the table is more than just a delicious meal though. Shokugeki no Souma is a satirical battle shounen that emphasizes more than just cooking. 
                              Imagine that you have a typical tournament-based battle shounen. Now replace the fighting... with food porn. The result is basically Shokugeki no Souma.
                              One positive thing I can say about Shokugeki no Souma is that it's an anime that knows exactly what it is - a ridiculously over-the-top sports/battle shounen with cooking as the centerpiece.
                              Shokugeki no Souma actually surprised me, i was really with the foot back if i would watch it or not but it ended up being very good.

                              Anime and manga are known to have the potential to make a subject that for most audiences is uninteresting to a compelling, enjoyable experience: such is the case of cooking. This theme has been explored before with less succesful titles such as ""Koufuku Graffiti"" or ""Bonjour Koiaji Patiesere"", but with Shokugeki no Soma it seems to have a huge success among the audiences, but why? 
                              This anime is a disappointment.I'm a big fan of the manga and was thoroughly saddened by this poor adaption.
                              Shokugeki no Souma. . . Where do I begin with this show? Well, let's start with the common description that's been drifting around the internet since its airing-- ""Food Porn"". It's an understandable title, really. Every episode features numerous mouth watering dishes that we the audience can't help but lust after. With most (if not all) episodes also featuring a foodgasm it's an apt moniker. That may cause some misconceptions however. By that description alone you may assume this to just be another throw away ecchi show. I won't lie, I had similar thoughts after the first episode that featured a truly terrifying scene involving          
                              Shokugeki No Souma or FOOD WARS is the number 1 ecchi/comedy/shounen of all time, period.
                              Culinary prowess has taken a decently large foothold in the world that we know today.  With many a aspiring chef coming to showcase their culinary chops, we follow the story today of an anime character named Souma, and his road to culinary greatness in, Shokugeki no Souma, Food Wars!  Let's dig in!
                              I honestly went blind into this anime and had no idea what to expect well except for food. But, my reason for continuing to watch this show was because of I can’t believe I am saying this – the parts where people become stark naked and have orgasms from the food they eat. Not to mention, that the tentacle porn like scenes also made me question how this show would go down. No kidding!
                              Before watching Shokugeki, I did not know how to cook. After watching Shokugeki, I don’t know shit about food at all.
                              THIS REVIEW DOES NOT HAVE ANY SPOILERS. Alright so, before writing this review I did watch until the end of the series and this review basically answers this question - Why should you watch Food wars? or Why did I rate Food wars 10? or what's good about it. I divided it into sections.
                              Gastronomy, a way for us to bombard our brains with sensations while stuffing our guts to survive. It started when lightning stroke a tree and the primordial humans sought it out of curiosity. Some have elevated cooking to art, yet others would consider it cruel to do so by regarding the famine that is grasping many others."
"One Christmas Eve, Hana, Gin, and Miyuki are rummaging for presents through heaps of garbage when they chance upon an abandoned baby in the cold winter night. Appalled at the pitiful sight, Hana's maternal instincts kick in and she insists on finding the baby's biological mother to demand an explanation. Naming the baby Kiyoko—meaning pure child—they begin their search using the possible clues left alongside her: a mysterious key and a single note. However, their plans are soon thrown into disarray as they get caught up in a series of unprecedented events.

Tokyo Godfathers follows the journey of the trio as they stick together through thick and thin, hoping to deliver Kiyoko to her true home, and find their very own Christmas miracle.

",8.29,8,238,747,200359,1738,"                              What else can I say... This movie had a great storyline, a huge unexpected twist near the ending, held mystery from the very beginning, had very witty humor (I caught myself laughing out loud many times), characters were well introduced, it was rather heartwarming as well, family-focused, gives definition to what life truly is, pacing and story progression was really good, art was outstanding, I really have to say that I enjoyed this movie A LOT. Made me remember the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Future but twisted it up a bit. This was a remarkable movie. I recommend it to everyone. I added          
                              I watch Tokyo Godfathers every Christmas. It's a fantastic Christmas movie, but it's not just a Christmas movie. It's also a fantastic family movie and a fantastic auteur film. It's Satoshi Kon's greatest movie, out of the few films he was able to make in his lifetime.
                              From the creator of Perfect Blue comes Tokyo Godfathers.
                              Satoshi Kon is widely considered an auteur of bizarre masterpieces. Perfect Blue, Paprika, and Millennium Actress are all strange, high-concept films to varying degrees. However, Tokyo Godfathers might somehow be his oddest film. This isn't due to the film taking the concepts of blurring reality and fiction to insane new levels while incorporating even crazier ideas. The film barely even touches the idea, and it barely even mentions the concept of film in any way. These are two of the greatest hallmarks of a Satoshi Kon movie, and they're largely absent. Therefore, this film is the biggest risk the late director had taken as it          
                              The holiday season is finally here, and with the holidays always come the festivities. Shopping, spending time with family, decorating the Christmas tree, cuddling with loved ones alongside the soft embers of the fireplace: these are all the ideals of a perfect Christmas. After all, there's nothing more to love about Christmas than the gifts or the food, right? Well, maybe if you're a middle-aged salaryman. To our three protagonists, they'd just be happy if they could find a leftover bottle of booze in Tokyo's garbage dumps. 
                              This movie is definitely a slow one to start out, but then it gets faster and more interesting towards the end.  Still, this movie is not the greatest ever, definitely not the greatest.
                              Tokyo Godfathers is a film directed by Kon Satoshi, who also directed the superb Perfect Blue, and co-written by Wolf's Rain creator, Nobumoto Keiko. With animation and production from Madhouse, whether it's the branch of Madhouse that ruins action scenes with random T & A shots or the branch that does stellar work remains to be seen. Yes, I have become convinced that Madhouse has one division to do animation for quality projects like Rainbow, Monster and the aforementioned Perfect Blue and another for their drek projects like Highschool of the Dead or Devil Hunter Yohko. Although in reality they probably have a lot more          
                              Critic’s Log - Earthdate: December 1, 2013. Review #72: Tokyo Godfathers.
                              I just sort of randomly requested this from my library on a whim, knowing what it was about but not quite sure what to expect. 
                              ""Tokyo Godfathers"" is a Christmas film. Tradition dictates that these films should contain elements such as light hearted comedy and family oriented themes. And that exactly the kind of film ""Tokyo Godfathers"" strives to be. 
                              It's a Christmas miracle!
                              Tokyo Godfathers is a rather unique film from Satoshi Kon as it differs from his other works in that the movie is not as heavy on the cerebral side. Set in Tokyo during the holiday season, the movie focuses on a trio of homeless people from different walks of life who come across an abandoned baby and journey throughout the city to learn of the whereabouts of the baby's parents. While doing this, each of these people come to grips with their tragic pasts as the movie explores the varying circumstances that led each of our main trio to wind up living on the streets.
                              Tokyo Godfathers is a work by Satoshi Kon, produced by Madhouse and was released in 2003. It is an original story set in the not-so-beautiful setting of Tokyo and deals with the themes of abandonment and family.
                              STORY: Overall, the story was pretty good. I find that altogether the story is pretty heartwarming, and pretty easy to understand. One thing that disappointed me was that, in the end, an event takes place, (I wont mention how far towards the end, or who), that really leaves you hanging, mainly because a lot of this is going on during the main story. Other than that the story was great!  
                              Well...Hmmm.. Tokyo godfather. What can I say?  "
"With its armies sweeping across the continent, the Empire seems unstoppable. After securing victory over the remnants of the Republic's army, the Empire's ultimate victory is finally within reach. However, dark clouds are gathering in the East. The communist-led Russy Federation is mustering troops on its western border, preparing to enter the war. Supported by a detachment of Allied volunteer magicians—among whom is Mary Sioux, the daughter of a soldier killed by Tanya Degurechaff—the Federation is determined to spread the communist creed and bring the Empire to its knees.

Meanwhile, Tanya and her battalion return to the imperial capital from the southern front. Upon their arrival, they are tasked with investigating troop movements on the border with the Federation. Any escalation of violence at this point may lead to new conflicts, plunging the world into a devastating global war.

",8.28,8,239,927,161764,764,"                              Spoiler-Free Review!
                              The long awaited sequel to the Youjo Senki series, this movie brings in a new character and antagonist to light. Once again, our sociopathic salaryman loli finds herself in a complex predicament reminiscent of our world’s historical world wars, facing the interference of being x at the worst possible times. Like the original series, Tanya’s squad 203 sets out to face enemies that appears impossible to win against, according to their political and strategic heads, and the battles are reflective of the nature of difficulty.
                              Just personal scratch.
                              While the movie I feel is good, I am somewhat disappointed at it. It pains me to say this since i'm a big Tanya fan. One of my big problems for the movie is that, while the movie is action packed, battles are quite often short or skipped, then summarised. I feel like I was constantly being teased with those battles with really no pay off until the final big battle. Another problem I have is with charactor growth/arc. I don't want to spoil anything so I won't go into details. I feel like the main atagonist Mary Sue's arc was just way to speed          
                              The anticipated sequel of Youjo Senki has finally arrived & starts off immediately from where it left off (along with some “spoilers” of the future events). From start to finish, the movie has Tanya kicking butts left & right, the Infamous loli smile and Tanya kicking butts again but this time with style. Although the story and characters felt pretty bland to me but had a great time watching it nevertheless.
                              ITS FINALLY BACK!!!!!
                              A few months late to writing a review. Youjo Senki's film debut offers the same great animation, humour, story and action that fans of the series have come to expect, dialled up to 100. The film manages to encapsulate everything that's great about Youjo Senki and is fun throughout. I was certainly not disappointed.
                              I'll keep it short.
                              In the approximate time it takes Tanya to turn a battle around I saw the series and the movie lol.
                              Subarashi!
                              After watching the movie, I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed it. If you liked Season 1, hope you're ready for some new content in ""Loli Hitler VS The Commies.""
                              This review will include **SPOILERS**
                              I can still feel the dread curling in my stomach as I watched each and every moment of this wonderful movie. As an avid action fan, I couldn't help but be thrilled at Degurechaff's victories and dread her losses/missed opportunities. The story jumps right in without any recap, so it's best to watch the previous series, but let's be honest if you're here for this movie specifically you would've watched the series. The music and art are spectacular as always with the sounds always amped up for dramatic effect or quieted down to amplify the sense of death/not blow your ears out which I appreciate(a          
                              The only think I didn't like about this was that the CGI was at some points bad, but that's a common problem within most anime... just look at Dragon Ball Super: Broly.

"Joe Yabuki is a troubled youth, whose only solution to problems is throwing punches at them. What he lacks in manners and discipline, he makes up for with his self-taught fighting skills.

One day, while wandering the slums of Doya, Joe gets into a fight with the local gang. Although greatly outnumbered, he effortlessly defeats them, drawing the attention of Danpei Tange—a former boxing coach turned alcoholic. Seeing his potential, he offers to train Joe into Japan's greatest boxer. At first, Joe dismisses Danpei as a hopeless drunk; but after the trainer saves his life, he agrees to live with him and learn the art of boxing. Unfortunately, Joe's personality makes him an unruly student, and he often falls back to his old ways.

To survive the harsh world of his new career, Joe needs to trust his mentor and master the techniques taught to him. However, the road to becoming a professional boxer is rife with struggles that will test his mettle to the end.

In many ways, it does hold up as the benchmark that it is regarded as being - but in many other ways, it requires a ""good for its time"" disclaimer, as do many of its contemporaries.
                              Welcome to what I call one of the most epic animes ever. Try to imagine a Japanese version of Rocky, and this is what you get. But I say Rocky is the American version of Ashita no Joe since Rocky came out in 1976, and the original manga of Ashita no Joe started in 1968 and ended in 1975. But anyway, they share the same charms and are both iconic to their respective nations in their owns rights. The story is reasonably paced and easy to follow, and tells a life story about a young man&rsquo;s career and his struggles in and out of the

                              Warning! This review contains spoilers, so I recommend that you finish the first season before reading this review. 
                              I really wish I could recommend Ashita no Joe anime cause the manga’s story deserves to get a good adaptation and have more people experience it. Unfortunately, both as an adaptation and on it’s own show, AnJ is just bad.
                              Note 1: I am not english speaker
                              Script - Joe is that type of show that proves quality as timeless. How could it be for a story from the late 60s about a boxer become so important, poignant and meaningful to me in the long term? I have no idea, but I'm pretty sure Ikki Kajiwara knows that well enough to come up with one of the best sports tales ever known and that in my humble opinion wasn't surpassed ever since, at least not by any anime or manga. But what's Joe all about? It's about Joe, your not average underdog who's searching for meaning and is trained by an old          
                               How can I describe in words the very high qualities of this work of art, a classic of Japanese culture that until today, is a symbol of references and inspirations of its archetypes. The anime, Ashita no Joe, has a great quality in its characters, especially the main one, which starts out as a damn annoying youngster to a young man that you will definitely love for the rest of the play, not only in Joe (main) but in his other main ones too, having their development and charisma only lifted over time. Ashita no Joe also shows her technical side with regard to

                              Ashita no Joe is simple the best ''sports"" series
                              Ashita no Joe - The First Shonen Anime and the Best!
                              Ashita no Joe is a anime that aired in the 1970's and is arguably one of the founders of sports anime as a whole. But calling this series just a sports anime would not be doing it justice. While yes the story does mainly focus around Joe's boxing career, intermixed with this is fantastic drama, superb character development, and absolutely gripping suspense.
                              Joe is a classic boxing anime that started in spring 1970. It was made by Mushi Productions and directed by Osamu Dezaki. The show follows Yabuki Joe's road from a juvenile delinquent kid, all the way to becoming a pro boxer. Joe is a rude and quick tempered guy who is quick to get into fights. Joe packs a serious punch though, and this catches the eye of ex-boxer Tange Denpei who wants Joe to become a boxer. But because of Joe's troublesome nature he gets sent to juvie. There he meets boxer Rikiishi Tooru, who becomes Joe's rival. 
                              After completely binge watching 79 episodes of this boxing anime, I can say that it is a heart wrenching sports story. Never have I watched an anime where I started out hating the main character (Joe Yabuki) as much as I did and then find myself rooting for him. The development of Joe from when he first shows up in the Tokyo slums up until the very last moment of the show is a rare progression of a character if I have ever seen one. 
                              I'd like to preface this review by saying, I finished watching Ashita no Joe ages ago, quite literally the day before MAL went down so it wasn't until now I could write this review. I also recently bought the Tomorrow's Joe Blu-Ray and watched it as a refresher, so I remember everything pretty well. "
"Kaiji Itou is a good-for-nothing loiterer who spends his days drinking beer and stealing hubcaps—that is, until he ends up being tricked by his former co-worker. Unable to suddenly repay his friend's huge debt all by himself, Kaiji is offered a shady deal to participate in an illegal underground gamble on a cruise ship. This turns out to be nothing more than the beginning of his new life of hell—thrown headlong into a life-threatening roller coaster of mind games, cheating, and deceit.

Based on the first entry of the famous gambling manga series by Nobuyuki Fukumoto, Gyakkyou Burai Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor follows our unlucky protagonist as he is forced to fight not only other people, but also the mysteries of their psyches. Kaiji finds out the hard way that the worst sides of human nature surface when people's backs are against the wall, and that the most fearsome dangers of all are greed, paranoia, and the human survival instinct itself.

                              Kaiji, maybe is one of the genius anime that would be rarely be consumed these days. Many reasons for it, like people these days are just loooking for anime which have cute girls (or we can said seeking for MOE). Cant blame on it since anime industry now are using cute girls for their sales and of course for seeking profit.  Anyway, there is no cute girls in Kaiji so please step out if you’re looking for it. But honestly you would miss a show that would make hold your breath from the beginning to the end.
                              Edit: added more stuff and reworded some things
                              Many say that slow Anime series are always the boring ones, and they might be right in what they say, because who has the nerve and patience to sit through a twenty minute length of an episode with barely any action and dialogue that keeps being shoved into their faces? This is what people usually think of when they think of slow paced Anime series: No excitement, no intriguing arcs and no endearing characters. All in all, most people think that slow paced Anime series are not enjoyable, until they watch Kaiji Ultimate Survivor. Kaiji Ultimate Survivor proves that a series that relies heavily on          
                              What happens when you take the &quot;No one win's but I&quot; attitude and you place it into the hands of a bunch of desperate, shameless losers?  Why, you get Kaiji of course!
                              I chose to write a review about this anime because people have to know how good it is.
                              Kaiji Ultimate Survivor explores human vices, the temptation of evil & the shattering of hope all through the usage of gambling. Kaiji is a psychological thriller building much tension as Kaiji's thoughts on society & goodwill are put into question.
                              Kaiji was a very interesting series for me, in that I found it to be so incredibly hit-or-miss, it's difficult to review.
                              With the various 10’s all dominating the top reviews for Kaiji on MAL, I found it even more necessary to get a review written of my own for this series.  Gyakkyou Burai Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor is an anime focusing on suspense and intense twists and turns along the way of its storytelling.  This series had me on the edge of my seat at times, but I became bored with it at others due to certain segments being drawn out longer than necessary.  Let’s break down each section individually.
                              Kaiji isn’t a mainstream series like Naruto or Bleach. If your high school has an anime club and that is where you hear about the series you watch, then you probably haven’t heard of Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor. However, if you spend time on MAL and read through suggestions, you have probably at least heard of Kaiji as a sophisticated and highly lauded work. I will be examining this 2007 anime that is already widely viewed as a timeless classic. Instead of my usual format, I will be breaking the review into pros and cons because Kaiji is a special series, so I figure it deserves          
                              This series does not get alot of love. If you don't enjoy enjoy thinking alot about your anime, you will not like this.
                              Kaiji is another gambling series done by the same people who made Akagi. If you happened to read my review on Akagi, you will notice how disappointed I was. But the same cannot be said about Kaiji. This time the producers realized their mistakes and fixed it. Now, this is a gambling series done right. Thumbs up.
                              Kaiji is an anime you would probably avoid at first glance. To be honest, I did too when I first saw it. It stayed in the back of my mind for a few months until a friend told me it was great and I found out that the artist and creator was Korean. So, with a bit of reluctance, I started viewing Kaiji and I was blown away. The artstyle quickly became very enjoyable and I didn't mind the pointy noses or weird eyes after the first episode. If you are avoiding this anime due to the odd artstyle, do yourself a favor and stop          
                              First off, the reason that I am writing this review is that I feel this series is too overrated, the two current reviews here are both exemplary of that.
                              Murphy's Law, whatever can go wrong WILL go wrong. This is the basic premise surrounding almost any anime related to games. As you watch a show like Kaiji, you already know that over the course of whatever game they are playing, things will go badly. The key to these shows it to surprise you anyway, to be caught off guard by the things that go wrong, and to be impressed when the good guys overcome the odds. "
"Unlike his friends, Takumi Fujiwara is not particularly interested in cars, with little to no knowledge about the world of car enthusiasts and street racers. The son of a tofu shop owner, he is tasked to deliver tofu every morning without fail, driving along the mountain of Akina. Thus, conversations regarding cars or driving in general would only remind Takumi of the tiring daily routine forced upon him.

One night, the Akagi Red Suns, an infamous team of street racers, visit the town of Akina to challenge the local mountain pass. Led by their two aces, Ryousuke and Keisuke Takahashi, the Red Suns plan to conquer every racing course in Kanto, establishing themselves as the fastest crew in the region. However, much to their disbelief, one of their aces is overtaken by an old Toyota AE86 during a drive back home from Akina. After the incident, the Takahashi brothers are cautious of a mysterious driver geared with remarkable technique and experience in the local roads—the AE86 of Mount Akina.

                              I like watching sports anime. People who know me and have accepted the fact that I am a hardcore couch-potato find this hilarious. But the irony doesn't end there. I am a member of minority who does not possess a driving license nor has the faintest clue about driving. 
                              I just finished this series and I KNEW I had to review it right away! Holy shit this series was a trip! Initial D is a series that everyone has heard of, but not as many people have actually watched it. It's not in the top 600 most viewed series on MAL, yet it's somehow so famous that non-anime fans know about it. We all know it's that racing anime with the CHEESIEST OST in existence that spawned all those memes. It's also one of the only pre-2000 series in the MAL top 250. The others are all series like Rose of Versailles, Galactic Heroes,          
                              At first, I&rsquo;ll admit that I did not think I would like the concept at first, but other factors which I will further elaborate on would keep on pulling me into this franchise and would like it more and more. I know it&rsquo;s not the most exciting or appealing anime, and that I&rsquo;m not the biggest gear head, but I felt something special about this one. Even though Takumi is not exactly the most appealing anime character of all time, it&rsquo;s kind of weird that his lack of charisma in some ways makes him charismatic at the same time because he does all his talking          
                              ""Initial D is a good series. Please give it a try. Don't let it die as a ""good meme"", it deserves more than that."" - some random ass dude in the youtube comments. 
                              Vroom Vroom, if you're into street racing then you'll love initial D. Tak is so gosh darn thicc and irresistible, and my homeboy Shingo can hit a drift faster than anybody can smack that nae nae. Whevever my homeboy Tak does a drift everyone goes zoo wee mama, including me. Bunta is smarter than any Rick and Morty and he smokes really cool. Because of him i've become a heavy smoker and my life expectancy has gone down to 30 years. My boy itsuki sucks at drifting, but he is such a qt π and he does the most epic fails xD. Overall, I'd give          
                              Yeah, this is one of those shows that have a niche audience that I'm not gonna have interest in continuing further with. I've heard quite a bit about Initial D since college where it was popular with street racing fans and even served as a gateway drug to anime for some. It even gets poked fun of for its subpar animation in some comedy anime like Lucky Star and School Rumble, which I'll cover a little later in this review.
                              A friend told me about this Series, the other day. I was skeptical when he explained what it was about. He said it was about street racing and mainly about the cars. To be honest, I am not all that interested in cars. I am like the next person and have a mediocre interest, but not enough where I would be overly excited to watch a series about cars. 
                              To start off this review, I have to say; the saying ""it's not for everybody"" has never been more accurate for anime.  As a huge car enthusiast, I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed this anime and finished it in only two days (first stage).  Because most cars are automatic nowadays, most people won't have any idea about how manuals work or even about the lost art of double clutching or toe/heel techniques.  Seeing little things like this was totally nostalgic and made the show just that much better for me.
                              First Stage review
                              Takumi Fujiwara is an average 18-year old high school student with an average job as a gas station attendant, and a not-so-average hand in the family business. To help his father's tofu shop, Takumi has been delivering tofu in his father's 'Eight-Six' Trueno to a hotel at the peak of Mt. Akina. Every night at 4 a.m. He's is brought into a world full of street racing and eventually over time feels compelled to become the best drift racer in all of tokyo. He is soon plunged into a world of competition and contests against some of the greatest racers in the japan prefecture.
                              So its pretty clear I am a fan of anime due to being on this website and of course I am a fan of cars. Combine the both and you have a recipe for success! It surprises me how a simple story about street racing can be so good! 
                              Let me state first off all that I don't really like cars that much. My dad likes it a lot and frankly, I still don't know why. Even now, after watching the series, it hasn't increased my interest in racing. So one would think that a guy like me, a guy completely oblivious to racing, would drop a show like this immediately.
                              Just finished Initial D, and I have to say it was a wild ride, it was a lot of fun. The races were pretty much the only attraction to this show, but they were filled with a lot of hype, tension and excitement. Just watching the cool drifting and thinking about how a certain character was going to win was a lot of fun, the racing was great. 
                              ""Initial D"" is a good sports anime about racing and definitely worth watching. The high school story is rather boring as it has been done many times and much better, but the racing aspect of this show is unique, pulls in watchers, and will get your heart racing.  The animation is an older style and not as fluid as it is from 1998, however the older character designs are a refreshing change from the near identical character designs of many current anime.  Also the racing scenes are in CG so that may be off putting to some.  As I have not watched          "
Music video for the song Kawaki wo Ameku by Minami.,8.28,8,241,3921,17409,171,"                              The song is remarkable but the visuals generic, flat and boring. As music VIDEOS go it deserves better. The OP this song comes from (Domestic Kanojo) while not fantastic either is way more visually interesting; it's rather unfortunate that the OP doesn't portray the entire song. This is not a music review site it's an ANIME site so I'm not sure if you expected for me to judge it on the basis of the music alone when the entire point of this video seems to be the creation of visuals that complement the song. Well it at the very least ""moves"" to the music in          
                              I have already stated this in my Domestic Girlfriend anime review, but since it's clear that vast majority of users have not read it, I will repeat myself: Its opening song is easily the best song from Winter 2019 anime lineup. I was surprised to find out that its full version, 'Kawaki wo Ameku' -- now with its own animated music video -- had a separate entry on MAL database where it had also slowly risen to the top 100 anime list in a short time. But even more so, I was surprised to agree with the consensus on how well-made it is.
                              In my opinion this is the best opening of this season."
"With the Interhigh Championship finally over, Seirin's basketball team refocuses their efforts, training harder than ever to get the chance to participate in the Winter Cup. Both Kuroko and Kagami see old friends walk back into their lives, providing a challenge both on and off the court.

As new skills are developed and new alliances created, enemies from various teams—giants of high school basketball such as Yousen, Shuutoku and Touou—stand in the way of Seirin's steadfast attempts to get to the top. All of these schools prove to be formidable foes whose abilities progress exponentially, while Kuroko struggles to find a balance between his resolve to play as part of a team and his desire to win. 

With old wounds reopening, new challenges to face on the court, and a new set of foes—the ""Uncrowned Kings""—vowing to defeat the new hopefuls, will Seirin ever be able to achieve their dream of beating the Generation of Miracles?

                              The long awaited second season of Kuroko no Basuke- if you found the first season enjoyable, then I assure you... the second will not disappoint.
                               Kuroko no Basket is actually one of the most exciting sports anime I've watched so far, indeed, some people may say it like ""damn those characters can play fcking godly!"" for most kiseki no sedai players, but that's what makes the show more interesting right?
                              Sports have always been a popular topic for debate. Every game is different that shows new elements and surprises. Some of these include plays that will be memorable for years while other includes players that makes in impact in the business. In order to make an impact in basketball, one must have the passion and desire to not only win but play for everyone including themselves. The fundamental concept is that sports should also be played not just for competition but also to develop one’s own character. In Kuroko no Basket 2, we witness characters in a different light as they step up to the          
                              Kuroko no Basket Season 2
                              Kuroko no Basket season 2 will not disappoint you in any way. It is as good as season 1 and in some aspects one may claim that it is better.
                              Kuroko no Basket Season 2 continued right where Season 1 left off, and in fact, the entire story got even better. The basketball matches became even more exciting with the addition of ""the zone"" and there was more basketball action instead of character development/chatting. But there were even more characters to enjoy watching. Kuroko no Basket Season 2 was all in all so much fun!

                              This is one of, if not, the best shounen sports anime I’ve ever seen. Sports anime that are based around American sports, can often fall into the category of being comically poor representations of the sport they’re portraying. KuroBasu has already established itself as being a show that, while dramatized, still offers an informed view of how basketball actually works. The 2nd season of the show continues to build on a strong foundation of the first season, adds compelling dimensions to the characters, and an ever increasing intensity in the games.
                              I enjoyed watching KNB season 1, but season 2 was a great disappointment.
                              Kuroko No Basket season 2 is the best out of all the seasons. It has Kagami vs Aomine the most exciting match ever, and it featured both teams at full power. Shows a little bit more character development to Murakibara, the Aomine hype is still there but not as much anymore. It has excitement, character development, and intense AF matches. It has the most exciting breathtaking matches out of the three seasons, and I felt like the characters improved the most in this season. Certain characters like Himuro have been introduced and he fits in the story really well, plus Aomine vs Kagami in the          
                              Kuroko no Basket is one of the shows that one can't criticize easily ,it was  very interesting . i really enjoyed the exciting moments throughout the anime 
                              Kuroko no Basuke 2nd season, I'll be writing this review with the idea that you've seen the 1st season.
                              Kuroko no Basket
                              I never thought I would like Kuroko no Basket. I am a lazy teenage girl, sport just isn't my thing, and yet here I am completely hooked on this anime that revolves around sport - I've found myself rewatching matches over and over and I went as far as to read the whole manga in a day because I couldn't wait for the next episodes to come out. Everything about this series adds up."
"After celebrating their victory against Al-Thamen, Aladdin and his friends depart the land of Sindria. With the end of the battle, however, comes the time for each of them to go their separate ways. Hakuryuu and Kougyoku are ordered to go back to their home country, the Kou Empire. Meanwhile Aladdin announces he needs to head for Magnostadt—a mysterious country ruled by magicians—to investigate the mysterious events occurring in this new kingdom and become more proficient in magic. For their part, encouraged by Aladdin's words, Alibaba and Morgiana also set off in pursuit of their own goals: training and going to her homeland, respectively.

Magi: The Kingdom of Magic follows these friends as they all go about their separate adventures, each facing their own challenges. However, a new threat begins to rise as a great war looms over the horizon...

                              Note: I'm writing this review under the assumption that you've seen Labyrinth of Magic (the first season), so if you haven't, I'd suggest watching that first and then reading this review. There will be minor spoilers from the first season. You have been warned.
                              If I had to describe Magi, it would be more than just about magic. Sure, there are wands, hats, and spells along with magical kingdoms of witchcraft and wizardry. What sets Magi a bit different is its conventional way of presenting the series in a world building form. From the start, it’s easy to notice that Magi takes the tone of an adventurous tone following protagonists Alibaba, Aladdin, Morgania, and. Hakuryuu Ren. No exception is the fact that these characters all have gone through hardships and became who they are today. Magi: Kingdom of Magic explores not only the identities of these characters but also          
                              Yeah you read my ratings right, its that brilliant.
                              I'll start by saying that I'm both surprised yet not that this anime isn't as popular as it could've been (by far). As my first review, this might be paced awkwardly so bear with me. That being said, I've watched dozens of animes and can easily say this one is review-worthy :3
                              The realm of ""Shonen"" Anime & Manga is encompassed by two major things: Conformity and Mediocrity. The term itself; ""Shonen"",  immediately conjures a vast plethora of negatively inclined connotations, many of which are based off of only a small array of relatively insipid and generic titles, thus leading to an offhanded generalization that ""It's shonen, it must be bad."",  leaving many other unknown titles failing to receive the attention they may or may not deserve.  This seems to have muddled a lot of the thoughts of the average anime viewer, and so when one is suggested a title, say, ""Magi: The Kingdom

                              Magi: The Kingdom of Magic is the second season of Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic. For those of you who have not watched the first season, I highly recommend it unless you have zero interest in the fantasy-action-adventure genre. For those of you who have watched the first season, the good news is that Magi II does not disappoint. Everything that you enjoyed and liked about Magi, whether it be the diverse cast of characters, the battle orchestration, or the plot development, Magi II delivers. 
                              This series or aptly put the second season of Magi franchise is filled with themes of exploration and adventure. The story is a unique spin on Arabian Nights and creators have made it highly intriguing and fascinating by giving new shapes to our favorite characters. I liked it because I was excited by seeing the new Avatars of my beloved characters. It was exciting to see an all star squad of heroes. 
                              -
                              If it’s only enjoyment that you are after, then Magi: The Kingdom of Magic may suit your taste and entertain you well but if you are looking for an anime that has depth, then this may not be the closest one. Whether which is which, don’t get your expectations too high!
                              If you haven't watched Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic, then read no further but if you have, continue as want.
                              A catastrophic collapse and blunder is what the kingdom of magic can be described as. It takes a weird direction in terms of storytelling, character building and world building and centers it around a conflict that is brought upon due to mere selfish desires. The first season subtly built its world through political conflict, internal strife between characters, and eccentric disney like environment/setting. The Kingdom of magic deviation from it's predecessor seemed like a wild decision because any viewer can tell from the first few episodes that Magi was taking a new approach in how it continues to build the world and characters.

In reality, they are just an everyday trio of ordinary guys trying to pass the time, but who said everyday life couldn't be interesting?

Boring, if you ask me. I used to think that a pure comedy show revolving around high school students life is so common and dull, my perception changed after I watched Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou, I will refer it as Nichibro from this point. The title may give you a doubt, I wouldn't be surprised if you're skeptical, what's so great about watching a comedy anime revolving around highschoolers' everyday life? I'd say Nichibro stands out because it succeed in delivering what it offers, that is comedy.

                              Pros: Great comedy, short length, skit and episodic format make it easy to pick up
                              The story actually does not deserve a 10, but each episode had its own individual story that was pretty creative and all-out hilarious. This was probably the funniest anime I've seen, especially the starting scene. The opening song is great and the characters are really likable. This is not a sentimental anime that will make you cry, but just a comedic anime made for laughs. If you just want a funny anime this is my favorite. 
                              Words cannot describe the ingenuity behind what seems to be very common and ordinary everyday practices that we sees them as 'jokes'. Every single skits have been re-watched more than my re-watch of Christopher Nolan's Batman films and the Star Trek series. The show has me grinning like a fool for hours to end, even after I've finished the show and wished for a season 2. 
                              This anime is obviously about High School Boys and their daily lives, or should I say, the highlights of their daily lives? 
                              I haven't seen many anime to begin with, and I sure as hell did not know what to expect from a highschool themed anime after series like FMA:Brotherhood, Neon Genesis Evangelion, Death Note and the likes.
                              Ah, slice-of-life. If you are not one to enjoy putting yourself into the character's shoes... well you should at least give it a try for this anime. Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou is quite different from other comedy anime because rather than having a continuous plot, it has various skits. I am not exaggerating when I say this is my all-time favorite comedy anime (I have not watched Gintama yet so maybe my opinion will change).
                              First off, I died watching this show. If you're looking for a comedic anime this one is pure gold. The situations or little skits it shows, will most likely crack you up because its just stupid. Though the show doesn't really have much of a plot it mostly just exist for comedic purposes. 
                              M'kay, this kinda bored the crap outta me, now I know that there are those of you out there who totally love this type of genre but I wasnt feeling this at all. "

This special episode is not for someone who is completely new to the anime (contrary to the title). This is for those who have watched this show in its entirety. And it will spoil a lot, if you were to watch this show. 
                              The whole episode is somewhat satisfying I rated it as 9. For me, the overall aesthetic of the narrative and phasing are a bit abrupt, but the sequencing of events are on point and so the story for the whole series became clearer/ clean.

There's several minutes of comedic buildup involving the usual trio to the eventual announcement, and then the remaining runtime is teaser trailers for future episodes. It wasn't awful; the comedy is what you'd expect from Gintama(references to running gags and some 4th wall breaks), but the actual amount of non-ad content was too minimal for me to get much entertainment out of it. Might have been better if I'd watched this back when it was released, but as of now, I'd recommend skipping this and starting to the second season.          "

Normally it takes more than a month for me to watch series this long. Usually I get bored before the ending and start new random series so in the end it can easily take like a year for me to complete all of it. How long did it take from me to go trough all of Major then? 6 fucking days.
                              Before you read this review, I would like to say that before watching Major I have never watched or played in a baseball game before. (My country has no baseball love &gt;_&gt;) Despite that, I knew some of the basics from a few video games I've tried a little of before. I cannot vouch for those who are already familiar with baseball as I will be reviewing from the point of view of a newbie.
                              I started watching Major with the expectation that it would be your stereotypical sports anime.  And if you boil it down to its bones, it sort of is.  But it's the meat of the story, the actual conflicts and the actual relationships and the actual characters makes this a really entertaining series to watch.
                              I was MAJORly excited to watch Major. I was afraid of it being a MAJOR disappointment, but it ended up being MAJORly fun! 
                              Major is a definite must-see for anyone that enjoys sports anime/manga.  The plot is pretty much your typical addictive shonen sports anime, but there is some noteworthy drama elements in there as well. I personally enjoyed the series very much, some parts were definitely tear-jerkers, the rest was adrenaline packed baseball. 
                              Holy cow. Watching this Anime was one of the biggest mistakes I have ever made. Ever.
                              I don't know what was wrong with me but it took me time to watch Major though to be a sport genre anime sport which is my favourite anime genre, and no, it's not the baseball game, I already learned from Cross Gamer that baseball have great deep playing than tennis soccer or basketball and specifically because of that it is very enjoying sport, it was not also the length of the franchise - the more the anime is long I more love to marathon it, and still I don't know what kept mo so long to watch Major.
                              I signed up on AnimeList especially to give this review, I just got through the 3rd season of Major after watching S1-S2-S3 almost non-stop.
                              Okay, disclaimer, baseball is one of my favorite sports. I never got to play it growing up because I had track and that was in the spring, but it's one of my favorites. I religiously follow my favorite baseball team in the summer. But that's not the point of this anime.
                              I can't believe I haven't stumbled upon this anime until 2018 ... I confess I've seen all of it in less than a month and OMG it was sooo good.
                              ""Never judge a book by its cover.""
                              Baseball. It has alot of mixed reviews when it comes to sports, but its just sports and its always amazing when you see someone give it all they have for the love of it.

                              This is how i review about Anime i watched and i will try my best to make my review short 
                              definitely worth a look, binged the series in a whole day and it brought me to tears at least 3-4 time. The first thing that caught my eye was the plot/storyline, just something intriguing and giving you the feeling of 'oh my, what's next' Secondly the characters! Probably one of the best protagonists you can have, Hasn't frustrated me once and have made me cry a few times. Hopefully, this review can give you a little insight of the anime, this is lowkey my first ever review online so I was lost for words at the number of times I saw 'not enough words'          "
"Having bid farewell to his former teammates at Kaido High School's baseball club, Gorou Honda returns to his hometown eager to continue playing.

Left with no other options, Gorou joins Seishuu High School, where his childhood friend Kaoru Shimizu also attends. However, Seishuu has always been an all-girls school until two years ago, so there is not yet a dedicated men’s baseball team.

But nothing will stop Gorou in his pursuit of Koshien. He must now create a baseball team from scratch with the seven male students at Seishuu, but all of them are complete amateurs! He decides to train the incompetent team up to nationally competitive levels, but such a feat is easier said than done. Will Gorou once again perform miracles?

"Shinichi Chiaki is quickly making a name for himself as the principal conductor of the revitalized Roux-Marlet Orchestra, and Megumi ""Nodame"" Noda has made leaps and bounds as a pianist at the Conservatoire de Paris. However, tensions mount between the two as Nodame feels left behind by Chiaki's growing success and his close friendship with legendary piano prodigy Rui Son. Disregarding her teacher Professor Charles Auclair's advice, Nodame enters another piano competition in an attempt to jumpstart her own performance career. 

Meanwhile, those around Chiaki and Nodame are at their own crossroads. Rui begins to doubt herself after hearing Nodame's playing and being denied tutelage from Auclair; Maestro Franz von Stresemann faces the reality of his mortality; pianists Yunlong Li and Tatiana Vishneva feverishly prepare for a competition, while the latter also struggles with her growing feelings for oboist and fellow student Yasunori Kuroki. 

As Chiaki, Nodame, and their friends continue on their respective journeys, they must not only strive to stay true to themselves, but also remember where it all started.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]",8.27,8,249,1296,110904,430,"                              Nodame Cantabile is truly a master piece because it got you hooked up from the 1st season till the 3rd season ending with beautiful music and awesome storyline it makes a really great anime.
                              This may be quite unfair but I really want to rate this show based on all 3 seasons and I am going to do just that. 
                              So, I just finished watching Nodame Cantabile Finale, the last season of Nodame Cantabile, and so my memory is still fresh about it, not that the anime is short forgotten, not by any given means, because this may well be one of the most memorable anime that I will ever be given the chance to watch.
                              *SPOILER FREE*
                              Paris-hen and finale could well have been made into one longer twenty something episode series as Finale directly follows from Paris-hen. If this was done Paris would have been better without affecting Finale.
                              Spoiler Alert!
                              I've watched this anime back when I was in elementary and now I've rewatched all 3 seasons having graduated from college. The experience watching this anime with different perspective of course is in itself different. Back then, all I knew was the comedy and romance genre of this anime. I was fascinated with the idea of music and Paris - that was the initial vibe I got from Nodame Cantabile. 
                              I'm not really fond of writing reviews, but I had to make a exception for Nodame Cantabile.
                              The first series to take the spot of ""personal favourite"" in my heart has been none other than the Nodame Cantabile series. This last part of the series proved to be an enjoyable watch like its prequels, however was lacking in the conclusiveness and depth of character development. I feel several plot articles were rushed and the end to not fully satisfy (hence needing me read the Opera-hen). 
                              Anime and Quality Films?
                              Nodame Cantabile: Finale only took me a day to watch through, and part of that is because it's an incredible addition to the NC series as a whole.
                              Finally, after putting it off for so long due to school, I was able to complete Nodame Cantabile. 
                              At last, we can see the closure to the one of much seen series of today’s anime.
                              Nodame Cantabile Finale is the third and final season of the series. This review assumes everyone reading has watched or is at least aware of seasons 1 and 2."
"Holo is a powerful wolf deity who is celebrated and revered in the small town of Pasloe for blessing the annual harvest. Yet as years go by and the villagers become more self-sufficient, Holo, who stylizes herself as the ""Wise Wolf of Yoitsu,"" has been reduced to a mere folk tale. When a traveling merchant named Kraft Lawrence stops at Pasloe, Holo offers to become his business partner if he eventually takes her to her northern home of Yoitsu. The savvy trader recognizes Holo's unusual ability to evaluate a person's character and accepts her proposition. Now in the possession of both sharp business skills and a charismatic negotiator, Lawrence inches closer to his goal of opening his own shop. However, as Lawrence travels the countryside with Holo in search of economic opportunities, he begins to realize that his aspirations are slowly morphing into something unexpected.

Based on the popular light novel of the same name, Ookami to Koushinryou, also known as Spice and Wolf, fuses the two polar genres of economics and romance to create an enthralling story abundant with elaborate schemes, sharp humor, and witty dialogue. Ookami to Koushinryou is more than just a story of bartering; it turns into a journey of searching for a lost identity in an ever-changing world.

                              A sensory description accompanied by fields of gold swaying as the west wind moves. A reference to a European legend so obscure most people living where the legend was current will have never heard of it, and well-used to boot. A depiction of change, of progress and of its accompanying alteration of people's perception. All in a preamble spoken in a soft voice.
                              Spice and Wolf is a Supernatural, Romance, Adventure anime set in a sort of fantasy, European, Medieval world. The story itself revolves around a young travelling merchant (Craft Lawrence), who encounters a legendary wolf god, in the appearance of a cute girl (Holo/Horo) and they end up travelling together. However for those expecting plenty of wolf action or full-on romance may be disappointed. Instead it basically follows their journey from town to town, helping each other on complex business deals, whilst coming across major developments and dilemmas. Of course there are pockets of action &amp; minor romantic developments but those don&rsquo;t play much part until          
                              I saw this anime because of a few recommendations online and several glowing reviews, however upon watching Spice and Wolf I have to wonder how old the writers of these reviews are that they can find this enjoyable. If you've read any other review on this show, you'll know it is praised for its ""character depth"" and its use of economics. Let me warn you ahead of time, I have seen puddles with more depth than these characters. They are extremely 2 dimensional, the dialogue might as well have been written by a junior high student, and the monotonous tone of the voice acting is          
                              ""Presented a whole new definition for anime. One of a kind story-plot. Intriguing character relationships.""
                              ""We won't laugh until we get the money, we won't cry until we go bankrupt.""
                              Overview:
                              Wolves are beautiful creatures to look at. You see them prowling around the woods with their pack and rule the territory that they claim as their own. There is no doubt that they have been the focal point in some anime shows over the years, but when have you seem them being used as an intelligent focal point in a show's narrative? Out comes Spice and Wolf, a tale that follows two of our heroes in their journey involving mercantilism, to convince us once and for all that you can pull off a simple concept and make something brilliant out of it.
                              It's an anime about economics. And cheating out of economics with a giant wolf.
                              In one word, spectacular.
                              Personally I did not especially enjoy &ldquo;Spice And Wolf&rdquo; for what it was originally advertised, its dealings and plots involving medieval economics. Those sounded promising but proved to be a bit too difficult for me to fully grasp and really enjoy. Sure, the various aspects of economy, trading and business were interesting and quite unique to see portrayed in an anime series like that, but in the end they did not seem to be able to bring it in such a way that it provided grasping plot material. The fact on most occasions they resorted to standard action events (double-crossings, betrayal, attack by wild wolves,...)          
                              At first I was baffled what kind of anime is S&amp;W and would it leave an impression on me when I watched it. Happily enough, it did and with a fresh genre that it introduced for today's generation.
                              Usually, when one thinks of fantasy, sword-wielding heroes and epic battles are the first things that come to mind. Indeed, these are the norm for the genre. While there are some great stories that fit into this description, such as Lord of the Rings, or Berserk (to name an anime), the genre can feel quite stale. In this sea of monotonous tales, Spice and Wolf provides a refreshingly different take on the genre. It is a charming, laid-back tale that treads in territory scarcely explored in fantasy: Economics.
                              The driving force behind any action we take can be attributed to the profit as a result of said action. Whether that profit is tangible or intangible, our lives are loosely based on a ""avoid punishments and collect rewards"" mentality. Yet, it is strange. We sacrifice our health in order to acquire wealth only to spend that surplus to recuperate our well being. In that sense, it is seemingly irrational for us to work without pause in with the hope that our efforts will be handsomely rewarded.
                              Spice and Wolf is a peaceful journey through a stylized, medieval Europe.  The story follows Lawerence Craft, a successful merchant, as he travels a winding path North to take his companion, the wolf-god, Holo, back to the home she has nearly forgotten."
